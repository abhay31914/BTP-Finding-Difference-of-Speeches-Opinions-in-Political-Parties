Speaking with Mohammed Wajihuddin, Aagha discussed why, despite being born in Karachi, she wants an Indian identity, why she supports PM Modi and opposes triple talaq – and why she blames the Pakistani authorities for the shocking murder of Sufi singer Amjad Sabri:
How do you react to Sufi qawwal Amjad Sabri’s murder in Karachi?
The violent death of Amjad Sabri, an artiste who gave so much to music, is shameful for Pakistan. He memorably sang the famous qawwali ‘Bhardo jholi meri ya Muhammad, tere dar se na jaoonga khali’ – but what has Pakistan given him? Bullets in his chest.
He was a man who did so much social work for the poor and who reportedly asked for security but was denied it – shame on the Pakistani authorities for treating artistes like this.
Is growing Talibanisation of Pakistani society stunting art and creativity?
It’s been over 15 years since i did a film in Pakistan, so i’ve not really tracked the art scene there.
But one thing is clear – nowhere do art and artistes get so much respect as in India. Here, creative people are worshipped. Bade Ghulam Ali Khan settled here. Ghulam Ali commands so much respect among Indians. Rahat Fatah Ali Khan is much in demand.
This is a country where art is valued – and artistes prosper.
How difficult was securing an Overseas Citizen of India status, given your own Pakistan connection?
Well, if i connect it with the film Nikaah i’m best known for, a Nikaah is better than a live-in relationship. Now, you can say i am officially wedded to India – though India has never been foreign to me.
This gives me hassle-free visits and only cements my bond with India. The bond goes back generations – my maternal grandfather, Jugal Kishore Mehra, who starred in the first Heer Ranjha (1932), had doted on my mother Nasreen. Mehra’s sister was Prithviraj Kapoor’s mother. Both my maternal and paternal grandparents were from Amritsar.
It’s wrong to say i am of Pakistani origin – i was born in Karachi but that happened because at that time, my parents happened to be there.
I hold a British passport – but India has always been a home. Even today, i stay in my mother’s house in Mumbai.
Since i hold a British passport and earned some respect due to my creative work, i received OCI status easily. Many people, including home minister Rajnath Singh and MoS (Home) Kiren Rijiju, cooperated.
How do you analyse Narendra Modi’s administration – and talk of intolerance in India?
PM Narendra Modi is leading from the front. He is a leader with immense energy and commitment to his people. My daughter and i heard him speak in Afghanistan and the US Congress – that he’s a brilliant orator was never in doubt but with his recent speeches, he’s proved he believes in inclusion.
My respect for him also grew after i saw the initiatives he’s taken for citizens – especially the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign.
And India is very tolerant. I have never felt insecure here.
Your admiration may be construed as opportunism – especially from certain Muslims who criticise Modi for not cracking down on Hindutva zealots.
Well, India is the best country on earth for Muslims.
India’s multiculturalism is the biggest bulwark against communal divides. Muslims in other countries are killing their co-religionists – here, they live in relative harmony. There is hardly any Shia-Sunni rioting in India.
Muslims must avoid confrontations and avail the opportunities which are there for those who grab them.
One confrontation is the current debate on triple talaq, an issue highlighted in your 1982 movie Nikaah – is it time to now stop instant divorce?
Nikaah was a path-breaking film, much ahead of its time – cases were filed and attempts made to stall its release. Director B R Chopra had to change its original title Talaq, Talaq, Talaq under pressure from Muslim outfits.
Triple talaq is un-Islamic in that it’s not sanctioned by the Quran – it’s a way to perpetuate patriarchy where men want to control women.
I’ve personally suffered divorce and know how painful it is. I often think, if my religion gives so much dignity to women, why do men deny women their rights?
Men have made their own rules – and pass them off as God-given.

Appeasement charges ruled the day. Both sides in Parliament screamed betrayal of the ‘weaker sex’ – if that description is not itself discriminatory. 
BJP said Congress and other opposition parties were giving in to vote bank politics to deny women their rights – as if women do not have votes. Congress and the rest said the government was reluctant to do enough for women. Somewhere there was a formal rejection of criminalisation. But all statements were ex cathedra and without sound reasoning. 
What was lacking in logic was sought to be made up by sound and fury. Without disrespect to BJP their case boils down to ‘use gender justice to inflict injustice on Muslims’, or kill a bird twice with the same stone. It is therefore important to understand the entire matter.

Talaq is effective even if said once (of course with such conditions as just cause and after mediation by representatives of both husband and wife). But during the iddat of three months – during which the wife cannot remarry – it can be taken back by the husband. After a month or two it can be repeated to reaffirm but can still be taken back. 
However when it is said the third time at the end of iddat it becomes final, though even without the third time talaq becomes final when iddat expires. The only difference between two pronouncements and three pronouncements is that the couple are free to remarry in case of the latter but not in case of the former. 
The triple instantaneous talaq is – or was – essentially talaq of the three times but said at one sitting instead of over three months. So essentially the only difference was that the husband denied himself the right to take it back or indeed to remarry the ex-wife after iddat. For the woman there was no real difference so long as the husband’s obligation of the iddat period were observed as they must.
Now the Supreme Court has declared triple talaq to be void. That means, as has been thought from times immemorial, that triple talaq pronouncement is treated as a single talaq as such but the man would still have the iddat period to either take it back or pronounce it again. There is no other difference.
However, the NDA government’s legislation revives triple talaq to declare it void afresh. Either way, there is no legal consequence of pronouncing talaq three times at once other than the effect of having said it once. In the circumstances, it makes no sense to impose criminal liability on something that has no legal consequences. 
Even if as a policy decision it is felt that some deterrent is called for, it could have been done without resorting to criminal culpability. It is meaningless to compare this with other criminal acts, because in each such case there is a consequence whereas after the Supreme Court judgment there is no consequence of pronouncing talaq three times at the same time.
We must be careful that there is no case against talaq per se or the entire Islamic system of marriage and divorce, described by Justice Rohinton Nariman as “astonishingly modern”. The learned judge clearly had in mind that contrary to the widely believed fact, Islam provides for a woman’s right to seek talaq by delegation, khula or dissolution of marriage, fask or annulment, mubaraat or dissolution by mutual consent. Besides for the marriage itself the woman has a right to mahar or consideration to give her consent. The nikahnama (marriage contract) is integral to the wedding ceremony and is signed by witnesses in addition to the parties.
As a matter of good public policy, criminal law must not intrude into personal lives of citizens unless there is a pressing ground for it such as physical violence. Many grounds of cruelty within a marriage are sufficient for divorce but certainly do not qualify for criminal prosecution. There is good reason for that because no civilised society approves of watchdogs in the family home. 
It is sad that some people point to what other countries do as though we have to permanently remain followers rather than show the way to an enlightened legal system. With triple talaq gone it is a waste of time to decry people for being sympathetic to triple talaq or seek punishment for those who foolishly utter it despite its ineffectiveness. 
Shorn of the noise and harangue the issue is not really about the empowerment of women, because in that case the government should have been looking at enhancing the benefit and protection granted by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 and other protective legislation. Ironically the present legislation is titled the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2017. 
The real intent is clearly to chip away at personal laws to bring in the uniform civil code. If that be so let there be at least an honest debate, and let the right view prevail.

The Quran does not encourage these practices, contrary to common perception, but patriarchy gives them social sanction among a few Indian Muslims. Either way, they have no place in our constitutional republic. Whatever form our various family laws have, marriage is a formal union between two individuals with certain rights and obligations, and it must be fair to both partners.
Legal reform should ensure equal rights to men and women across religious communities. The aim should not be to make marriage more binding on unwilling parties, but to make the terms better. Whatever our cultural differences, individual rights are sacrosanct. In a recent judgment on khap panchayats, the Supreme Court has made it clear that no custom or community writ can override the marriage of consenting adults.
Of course, social practices are not easy to extinguish by law alone. Moreover, even our codified family and customary laws disadvantage women in various ways in marriage, divorce, property and so on. Provisions on conjugal rights and adultery and division of matrimonial assets continue to harm women. All of them need to be made compatible with egalitarian constitutional principles. Even as we hope for a comprehensive and common family code that applies to all Indians, irrespective of faith, the courts now have to make sure that nobody is deprived of their rights in the name of religious or social custom.
Right now, the Domestic Violence Act does provide redress to all Indian women across communities, if subjected to polygamy or coercion. But the Muslim women who have petitioned the court want a clear strikedown of these practices within their community. The court must hear and amplify the voices of these women, rather than the patriarchal ulema who appoint themselves the sole spokesmen of the Muslim community. It must also extend that effort to all communities and acknowledge women’s agency and rights, no matter what social force stands in their way. No protective father or vengeful partner, no possessive caste or religious order, should stand in the way of individual rights.

     On the topic of nikah halala  (a custom by which a woman has to marry and consummate a marriage with someone else before remarrying her previous husband)I am reminded of a filmic story. The husband's best friend agreed to marry the dame and to divorce her later. He duly performed the first part of the agreement, but not the second.  (Note: the script was written by the dame, who hated her husband, and loved his best friend)....  Read More

This time, in contrast to the anxiety, stagnation, and hollow promises of the pre-2014 era, the public has seen the ability to reach targets ahead of time with strong leadership, trust in people, their cooperation and self-confidence. Undoubtedly, the Modi government has bridged the gap of six decades in six years and has laid the strong foundation of a self-reliant India.

Making India the world’s foremost economy from the “Fragile Five”, taking India out of the shadow of terrorism and preparing the country for a decisive fight against this menace, making sanitation a habit and culture of every Indian, pledging to transform the villages and lives of poor farmers in the true sense, India has now seen its ability to convert challenges into opportunities in the very first term of the Modi government. The first year of the second term has assured the people of the country that their dreams would be realised.
The BJP-led central government has implemented every promise in its manifesto. Its resolution has not only validated the importance of manifestos, but also strengthened the roots of democracy. Several historic decisions like abolition of Articles 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir, paving the way for construction of Shri Ram Temple, liberating Muslim women from the curse of triple talaq and giving citizenship rights to deprived sections of society through CAA: The Modi government has rectified the historical mistakes after Independence.
On the other hand, through the world’s largest health insurance scheme ‘Ayushman Bharat’, about 50 crore poor people of the country are relieved of the burden of treatment costs, empowerment of crores of poor women through Ujjwala scheme, financial assistance of Rs 6,000 annually to farmers, housing to every poor and access to banks through Jan Dhan account are some of the all-encompassing decisions of a New India. In this way, the Modi government has become an unprecedented example of coordination between ‘creation and reform’. It must be kept in mind that all the important bills were passed by both the Houses of Parliament, despite BJP not having majority in the Rajya Sabha.
The decisive assault on terrorism and corruption by the Modi government has instilled a different kind of confidence in the country. Terrorism has been blunted through the UAPA and NIA Act. India’s aggressive foreign and defence policies have put the country in the front row and there has been a complete change in the world’s view about the country.
In the first year of the second term of the Modi government, many decisions were taken giving a boost to India’s economy in spite of the global recession. These include paving the way for FDI in civil aviation, reducing corporate tax, merger of banks, moratorium on NBFC loans, reforms in the Companies Act, easy loan arrangements for the development of MSME sector among others. The decades long pending Bru-Reang Refugee and Bodo issues were also resolved in the first year of Modi 2.0. Similarly, the landmark decision was taken to create the post of chief of defense staff (CDS), again pending for decades. The interests of farmers and businessmen of the country were protected by opposing RCEP, whose importance is further underlined by China’s role in the coronavirus situation. Foreign investment was not only attracted by creating a defence industry corridor, it has also saved millions of crores of foreign exchange.
Pension schemes for farmers, labourers and small entrepreneurs, creation of a new ministry of Jal Shakti, one country one ration card, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the decision to increase the MSP of crops more than one and a half times, developmental scheme for aspirational districts, Ujjwala and Saubhagya Yojana as well as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for ODF India have established that economic growth especially in terms of GDP can also be achieved with the help of welfare schemes for the poor.
The Modi government has announced special economic package of more than Rs 20 lakh crore for people, economy, employment, agriculture and industries affected by lockdown that has been imposed to prevent coronavirus infection and this has heralded a new dawn for a self-reliant India. So far, more than about Rs 60,000 crore have been transferred to the accounts of the poor, labourers, farmers, widows, elderly and differently abled people in just two months through various schemes. A provision of free ration for the poor for five months has been made and a separate provision of Rs 40,000 crore has been made under MGNREGA.
While we were completely dependent on imports for PPE kits, ventilators and N-95 masks in early April, today we are able to mass produce them. Now, around five lakh PPE kits and 2.5 lakh N-95 masks are being made in the country every day. The indigenous versions of the ventilator are being manufactured by many institutions in the country at prices much lower than the market price. More than a million corona beds have been made available and we have also achieved a capacity of 1.5 lakh tests per day.
India has succeeded in stopping the spread of corona to a great extent due to the lockdown at the right time. Under Modi’s leadership, India is moving towards becoming a nation where equal and right opportunities for education, employment, medical facilities and advancement will be available for everyone. In the last six years, India is moving fast towards becoming a self-reliant nation by bridging the gap of six decades. Modi is the hero of this journey.

In response to the Supreme Court’s query as to the government’s stand on a Muslim woman’s petition to outlaw triple talaq, the government has taken the clear stand that the procedure violates the Constitution. It has added, to boot, that this sort of divorce is not an essential part of the Muslim religion. This is most welcome. All political parties, instead of waffling in fear of inviting the wrath of the Muslim clergy, should take the same stand without equivocation.

The BJP might or might not seek to use the triple talaq petition to polarise the electorate with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections early next year. The Samajwadi Party and the Congress, which hope to corner a share of the 18% Muslim vote in Uttar Pradesh, have argued that it is a sensitive issue and should be left to the religious community. This will not do. As Arif Mohammad Khan told this newspaper (Oct 20), the clergy will resist the move whichever party holds office — it had pressurised the Rajiv Gandhi government to legislate to void the progressive Shah Bano judgment that had upheld constitutional values of equality and justice over Muslim personal law.
The rights guaranteed to minorities are not an exception to, but part and parcel of, the democratic rights the Constitution enshrines. In a conflict between minority custom or religious practice and basic democratic rights, it is custom and religious practice that must yield. This is secular democracy and all parties must support it.

On the heels of BJP’s political dominance, an attendant quest is to understand how RSS locates its ideology in 21st century India. How does it now view emotive issues such as Ram Janmabhoomi movement and uniform civil code (UCC) from its position as the ideological anchor of the ruling party? Sunil Ambekar, a pracharak in RSS and the national organising secretary of its students wing ABVP, has tried to articulate the organisation’s current views through a book which details its world view. He speaks to Indrajeet Rai on the Sangh’s viewpoint on issues old and new:
Is Hindutva essentially anti-Muslim?
Hindutva is not divisive. It never was. It is a unifying factor. The ‘tatva’ in Hindutva always looks for unifying factors in different communities. In fact, Hindus and Muslims have same ancestors. We may look different and may have different praying styles today, but our ancestors were the same.
The RSS is not against Muslims. Sangh is against any kind of separatism. In fact, we opposed Partition. We wanted to keep Hindus and Muslims together. We are not against anyone.
Hindutva is not against any religion or any person, be it Muslims or Jews. The Sangh is against Islamic terror. Not only RSS, but the entire world, including Muslim-majority nations, are raising their voice against Islamic terror.
What about some important Hindutva concerns like Ram Janmabhoomi temple, cow protection, UCC and Article 370?
Let’s wait for the Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya. We have waited so long for the court verdict to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The RSS will abide by the SC judgment.
What if the SC verdict is not in favour of making a Ram temple?
Whatever happens will be within the constitutional framework. We will explore all constitutional means to build the Ram temple.
What about ‘Yeh toh kewal jhanki hai, Kashi, Mathura baaki hai (Ayodhya was just a glimpse, Kashi and Mathura remain unresolved)’?
Let’s just discuss the Ram temple issue for now. We should wait for the SC judgment on Ayodhya.
Article 370 is for all practical purposes abrogated. Once the temple issue is settled, will RSS work for the enactment of a UCC?
Till now, there has been no fair debate over the need for a UCC. Only in last few years, have we started discussing it. The idea of a UCC is to redress injustice against any community. These demands are being raised from within communities. Take the issue of triple talaq. The demand to scrap the practice of triple talaq was raised by Muslim women. The government and court came together and abolished the practice.
The enactment of a UCC is one of many issues that need to be resolved. There are many other pressing problems that we need to address. For instance, the problem of rising population is a concern for all. Environmental challenges are same for everyone. How to stop animal slaughter is an issue for all. ‘Save tiger’ and ‘save cow’ are equally important for me. How can ‘save tiger’ be secular and ‘save cow’ be communal?
There is a kind of hypocrisy and political agenda behind raising selective issues. Some people are making a selective list of killings and raising a hue and cry about it, but they are not discussing terrorism and Naxalism. No one is making a list of terror and Naxal violence victims. Don’t play politics over these issues. The RSS chief has talked about lynching in his Vijayadashmi speech. Lynching is not our tradition; it is an alien concept.
You have discussed family and emerging modern relationships in your work. What does RSS think about rights of the LGBTQ+ community?
The RSS is working on thousands of issues. We should discuss about farmers, rural and many other important issues. All these issues are important. But I think we should have a humanitarian approach towards the LGBTQ+ community.
We all know that RSS and BJP share a close relationship. How much has the BJP-led government at the Centre helped in the growth of RSS?
The Sangh works in an organic way. We approach people through our branches. Now, people are joining us through our website too. RSS kept growing even when it was banned. The Sangh is growing at its own pace. The Sangh keeps growing in spite of all odds.
What do you have to say about the ongoing power tussle between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra?
This is not my subject. I don’t think I should comment on this.

     Can a political rule stem from a pseudo-religious faith... stewed in identity politics... superficial holy cosmetic cover... most of the present regime tops are hard-core RSS cadre in the past...? Genuine politics focuses on multiple issues... upgrades.. drawing best of stalwarts from crucial fields... into the decision making apparatus...? Dedicated devotees focus on inner realms... while politics is an outer pursuit on specifics progress excellence in arenas of economic/scientific reckoning....? How can both be mixed...? Political rule... roles of institutions... their key slots chosen on political loyalty other things being equal... or even compromised to an extent... the deep rot in systems & processes yet to be revisited at large... can the politically motivated mis-adventures sustain for long... while scenes unfold in bitter angles - cover up or hypocrisy - talk sweetly, do the opposite -- take care of the national steam & spirit... can the Sun rays be covered by a colored huge blanket.....? :-) GOK...

It does not require an Islamic cleric or a constitutional scholar to find this practice abhorrent, discriminatory and disrespectful of women. It was thus little surprise that the Supreme Court outlawed instant triple talaq, a judgment hailed for empowering women in their struggle for gender equality.

But that is unfortunately where praise for the judgment must begin and end. Scarcely has a judgment with such a progressive outcome been underpinned by such regressive reasoning. The dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Khehar and Justice Nazeer considers triple talaq, despite being discriminatory, to be protected by freedom of religion in the Constitution. To offset this result, they recommend legislation by Parliament on this issue and before such legislation, prevent Muslim husbands from pronouncing triple talaq.
Justices Nariman and Lalit, in their majority view, consider Sharia law to have been statutorily incorporated by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. Given that all laws enacted by the legislature have to be in conformity with the Constitution, they hold Section 2 of the Act, to the extent that it enforces triple talaq, to be arbitrary. Justice Kurian, the swing vote, agrees with the conclusion of the majority that triple talaq is invalid. However he comes to this conclusion not on constitutional grounds, but pursuant to an ecclesiastical finding that triple talaq has no basis in the Quran.
The dissenting opinion is surely astonishing. If personal law can be constitutionally protected, then it is commonsensical that such personal law can also be challenged on constitutional grounds. Further, if it is constitutionally protected, neither can a Muslim husband be disallowed from exercising his fundamental right to pronounce triple talaq nor can Parliament be expected to come up with a law that says otherwise.
On the contrary Justice Kurian’s swing vote holds, arguably correctly, that instant triple talaq is against the tenets of the Quran and consequently not part of Sharia law. Given it is not part of Sharia law, he considers it outlawed by the Act and hence invalid. To resolve the matter at hand, this is sufficient. However, as an approach to resolving knotty questions of personal law, this enquiry would require judges to delve deep into religious texts to ascertain their true meaning.
The hazards of such an exercise are well-known to the judiciary from what followed in the aftermath of the Shah Bano judgment (1985). Sacrificing constitutional adjudication at the altar of religious pontification from the Bench is an unwitting dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution.
In contrast, a more conscious dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution takes place in the majority opinion of Justices Nariman and Lalit. By holding that the Court has the power to strike down parliamentary legislation as arbitrary under Article 14, it has converted a question of the rights of Muslim women into a contest for one-upmanship with Parliament. This is not what a landmark judgment for gender equality looks like – on the contrary its express silence on the core question of discrimination, speaks louder than its words.
Even when it has spoken – to partially outlaw Section 2 of the Act as arbitrary – it is conceptually flawed. Its finding compounds a conceptual misadventure that began with Justice Bhagwati’s view in Royappa (1973). Royappa held that governmental action could be challenged as arbitrary under Article 14 because the right to equality, enshrined in Article 14 mandated the rule of law, which was the antithesis of arbitrary state action.
Two examples demonstrate why bringing arbitrariness in through the backdoor of equality in Article 14 was faulty. If all spectrum licenses are cancelled with inadequate reasons by the state it is arbitrary, but hardly an act of inequality; conversely if universities have different rules for men and women in the interest of safety, the rules are unequal, but hardly arbitrary. Simply put, equality and arbitrariness are not the same thing.
Using arbitrariness as a sword to scythe through parliamentary legislation, risks the danger of collapsing the whole of the Constitution into one article. If Article 14 means arbitrariness and arbitrariness means nothing but the rule of law, then simply replacing the mass of provisions with Article 14 should do. This result means that the Damocles’ sword of a free-floating judicial determination of arbitrariness now hangs over every parliamentary and state legislation in this country.
In terms of upsetting separation of powers and arrogating powers to itself, this judgment trumps even the NJAC case. Politicians in a celebratory mood would be well-served to recognise that the Constitution is no longer supreme, the judges are.
In the final analysis, it is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women. On a matter critical to the lives of women in India, when five male judges of the Supreme Court rule on arcane questions of constitutional and ecclesiastical law instead of calling out personal laws as discriminatory, one knows that even if a victory has been achieved, the battle for gender equality will continue to remain a long and hard one.

The Supreme Court judgements on Sabarimala, triple talaq and Section 377 have shaken the backbone of many custodians of culture. Traditions are the manifestations of culture. These subjects are occupying a lot of media space, apparently due to multiple schools of thought. It was almost two years ago that I had penned in a blog post Packaging a Culture that the intangible cultural heritage – oral expressions, language, arts and crafts, rituals, traditions and practices, festivals and foods – travels on fluid grounds. The recent developments had made it imperative upon me to revisit my thoughts on the subject. However, the chores of routine – home or work – continued to interrupt the flow till the time I surrendered before an innocent question some days ago.
I had taken my daughter to the National History Museum to enable her to complete an assignment on Indus Valley Civilisation as a part of the school task. Upon visiting the Harappa and Mohenjodaro Section of the museum, we came across a skeleton where beside the preserved cadaver, some artefacts such as pots had been placed.

Her primary question on the relevance of pots was answered by the Explanation Note beside the skeleton.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-111364"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blog-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1378"" height=""1034"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blog-2.jpg 1378w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blog-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blog-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blog-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px"">
Her curiosity was beyond the basics.
She asked me, “How did they know that the food kept in these pots will be eaten by the dead person? When the person was dead, how could she eat?”
I politely told the little inquisitive soul that it was only a matter of their faith.
She was unfazed and insisted on a proper explanation.
I tried to hush up through a vaguely crafted statement that could see me through the ordeal, supported with my fatherly command. I told her that those people believed that the person had not died but moved to another place beyond this planet.
She looked unconvinced but moved ahead quietly. I was relieved. Suddenly, after 3 or 4 artefacts, she turned back to me and said in an emphatic voice, is their faith true?
The question was crisp but the answer was hazy. It was a small statement for the girl but a giant effort for the man (to reply!). I took the opportunity to accumulate the supporting evidences before answering. Did any exist? I pondered. How do we conclude the veracity of faith? Her question churned the inside of my mind.
Faith is an individual doctrine which evolves into a tradition as the co-believers increase. The manifestations are plenty – the religion, the superstitions, the astrology, the festivals and so on. In fact, more than 70% of total sales in our country happen during the Diwali season is an ample evidence of millions of individuals’ faith. But is that faith true? Someone perhaps needs to scientifically study the performance and longevity of the purchases made during the ‘auspicious’ period versus those made during the not so auspicious days. I relied on one such manifestation to answer the innocent question.
I asked her, “Do you remember that during Christmas season, you used to keep a wish-list under the pillow and next morning you would wake up, with loads of gifts around your bed? Who brought them?”
“Mama-papa” pat came the reply
But you believed that these came from Santa Clause
“Yes, because I felt happy thinking that there was someone called Santa”
“There you go”, I jumped with joy. She unveiled a different perspective and brought some harmony in my discordant thoughts. Faith, I inferred, is the harbinger of happiness. It is not a digital entity to be categorized as true/false. It is an individual’s construct of mind with no discrete values. It would therefore be futile to argue whether the faith was true or not.
We returned from the Museum without answering my daughter’s question.
As we sat in the cab for a drive back home, the newspaper carrying an item on Sabrimala decision carried my thoughts to the scholars, the guardians and the messiahs, currently engaged in endless debates. I was wondering when would they realise that the intangibles bear no framework, no skeletons; are fluid and fuzzy; and breed happiness beyond logic. I also mused whether it is a coincidence or some matter of faith that my daughter who unveiled a lesson of happiness is named Khushi….

     It definitely did add some Khushi to my mind at least.

Today, it’s against government’s triple talaq bill. Hasina Khan, one of Beebak’s founders, explains their reservations to Sugandha Indulkar:
 <img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-97723"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/edit-Haseena-Khan.jpg"" alt="""" width=""850"" height=""621"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/edit-Haseena-Khan.jpg 850w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/edit-Haseena-Khan-300x219.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/edit-Haseena-Khan-768x561.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"">
Why are you opposing the triple talaq bill?
We are not affiliated to any political party. We also do not support any Muslim religious organisation opposing the triple talaq bill. Having understood this, we firmly believe that the bill is a mere eyewash.
Real problems are faced by Muslim women who are denied fundamental rights – like freedom to pursue a successful career, not to be held at the mercy of their own families or mullahs, et al. Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution which awards certain fundamental rights to all Indian citizens do nothing for these women, who are governed by sharia – the Muslim personal law.
Bebaak Collective appeals to the government to pass a bill which works towards ending the disparity between Muslim personal law and the laws mentioned in the Constitution. Triple talaq bill makes no mention of these rights. It holds no promise of bettering the lives of Muslim women.
Do you mean to say the Constitution is not higher than the Muslim Personal Law? 
I always have had faith in Indian democracy. In the past, in each case, government had taken into confidence several civil rights groups and women’s groups, thereafter appointed a committee to examine closely all the provisions of a bill and then tabled it. In each case, right from the 2003 amendment to the PCPNDT Act (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994) to the 2005 Domestic Violence Act, to Section 498A under IPC – women’s rights groups have worked closely with the government and helped include effective provisions in the bills. This ensured that such bills truly work for women. The current authoritarian stand of the government isn’t acceptable in India.
Why are you opposing criminalisation of triple talaq specifically?
We are against criminalisation, primarily because it is inconsistent with the very provisions of the bill. On October 10 we met minorities minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, before which we had met Vijaya Rahatkar, chairperson of the Maharashtra State Women’s Commission. We requested the minister to create a committee to represent Muslim women which would have highlighted the plight of such women.
Divorce is a civil matter which cannot be made into a criminal matter. The bill states that a Muslim man who pronounces a talaq can be imprisoned. The bill does not have detailed provisions and definite clauses about how they will be implemented.
What is the government trying to do? It is not addressing the issues faced by Muslim women. Is it trying to target the Muslim community at large and mocking at the Muslim personal law? Why is it paving the way to criminalise a civil issue? Is this not a saffronisation policy? Why weren’t Muslim women’s groups allowed to discuss the nuances of the bill before it was tabled?
Let me enumerate why we are opposing criminalisation: There is no rationale to criminalise the practice of talaq-e-biddat (triple instantaneous talaq); since marriage is a civil contract the procedure to be followed on its breakdown should also be of civil nature; the bill is limited to triple talaq and does not address matters related to polygamy, practice of halala (remarriage of a Muslim woman) and other issues of discrimination faced by women in marriage and family; and criminalisation of instant triple talaq will further stifle the voices of Muslim women instead of offering them avenues for justice. All we want is an honest bill which will keep a civil issue within the civil domain.
Aren’t law and justice above religion?
Law and justice should always be above religion. Religion is a very personal matter – related to one’s belief and faith.
You think this bill will worsen the condition of oppressed Muslim women?
If the divorce is declared void, which means the man and woman are still in marriage, the question of subsistence allowance cannot emerge. Secondly, if the husband is imprisoned, from where will he provide for the subsistence allowance? Thirdly, will the woman be allowed to live in the married family after such a ‘void’ divorce? Where will she go, if she is thrown out by the husband’s family as their son is jailed because of the talaq?
The status of such a woman isn’t clear at all: is she still married because of a talaq which has been declared void, or is she divorced? How will such thoughtlessly made provisions do any good to anyone – either the oppressed woman, her children, or her family?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first Independence Day speech in his second tenure was remarkably communicative and packed with ideas. It had the hallmark of an encore. It began as a report card, not just of 2014-19, but also of the first 10 weeks this government has been in office.
Thereafter, the speech took on the shape of a policy statement and programme intent, backed by vital announcements that included the appointment of a much-deliberated chief of defence staff (CDS) — ironically, a poll promise made in the Congress manifesto. Interspersed with this was moral assertion. Modi used the podium of the historical symbol of power as a bully pulpit.
Portions of the speech where he ‘ideated’, carried the stamp of his ideological upbringing and commitment — conveyed subtly, a skill few in his political fraternity possess.

It was with the use of these elements and ideas on Thursday that the PM deftly appropriated spaces once the reserve of civil society (for instance, organic farming, reducing plastic consumption, etc). This underscores Modi’s repeated success in making groups — which otherwise would not endorse his views for political reasons — partners in the nation’s development and progress.
Skillfully, Modi stressed current concerns while leaving out those which cause political discomfort.
The speech again underscored the challenge the Opposition is up against. Modi’s statements on international challenges, coupled with his reach-out to select countries and refusal to respond to others, were testimony to the daunting task before forces inimical to India. No threat was held out. But every adversary, within India and outside, was made aware of the demographic and electoral backing for Modi and his ideas. Thursday’s speech stood in stark contrast to the one in 2014. Back then, Modi had nothing to show but a stunning mandate. In 2014, he raised hopes that those who did not vote for him, could also be part of his vision of a New India. This time, he presented his re-election as proof that people already had reposed ‘vishwas’ (faith) in him.
This appears at odds with the advice he meted out to NDA lawmakers after being re-elected their leader — that the principle challenge hereafter was to secure everyone’s trust. In 2014, Modi had listed the challenge as being that of ‘fulfilment of necessities’, while the priority in 2019 is ‘fulfilment of aspirations’ — a bit far-fetched, considering the people’s every ‘necessity’ is yet to be fulfilled.
Modi’s speech did not go beyond what he and home minister Amit Shah had already stated on the suspension of Articles 370 and 35(A) of the Constitution. Likewise, he spoke from the already articulated script when dealing with the criminalisation of instant triple talaq and amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Because these matters were referred to in the ‘report card section’ of the speech, Modi may justify not laying out the challenges to be faced on these fronts. But he lost an opportunity to address concerns of those not in sync with government on these matters — indicating that talk of reaching out to non-supporters still comes across as lip-service.
Unsurprisingly, Modi made no specific reference to economic challenges and planned initiatives — barring reiterating the $5 trillion economy objective. Aware that a spurt in private investment remains uncertain, Modi promised a major boost in public spending: Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure. This, he confidently explained, would generate jobs and put direly required earnings in the hands of people.
Modi performed a neat balancing act of ‘making amends’ for a Budget that had worried India Inc by stating that ‘wealth creators’ should not be looked at with suspicion and that they, too, were the ‘nation’s wealth’.
Given the serious economic challenges India is facing, such words may, at best, evoke a round of applause but will have little lasting impact if not followed through to show results.
Just as ‘unity in diversity’ was a recurring theme in all governments before Modi’s, this time, he repeated his unitarist mantra, especially in the next BJP objective of ‘one nation, one poll’. This administration, and Modi personally, will give greater push to this idea. Further ‘presidentialisation’ of Indian elections can only help one man.
Aware that few would find fault per se in his arguments for population control, Modi presented the need to have ‘small families’ as patriotic duty. With no talk of any roadmap on Thursday for picking up this Malthusian challenge, though, expect more on ‘less children’ from the prime minister — and from ‘emboldened voices’ from the Hindu Right believing themselves to be articulating his views from less responsible platforms beyond Lal Qila.

     Two important targets, a GDP of $ 5 trillion and infrastructure spending of $ 1.4 trillion, need to be fleshed out. While no one will mind if this journey takes seven years instead of five, NITI Aayog could break these overall numbers into actionable plans. From which sectors of the economy will major growth in GDP be generated, compiling an inventory of viable, bankable projects in infrastructure that can be taken up on priority, this detail would be useful. What else the government can do to not just acknowledge India Inc as wealth creators but help them at a particularly difficult time....  Read More

This law criminalizes the extra-judicial talaq of Talaq-e-biddat also known as Talaq-a-bain or triple talaq which was unilateral, irrevocable, one-time triple pronouncement of talaq available to Muslim men in India. The practice of talaq-e-biddat is highly debated among Muslim scholars and some of them reiterate that this is void of any religious sanction. This was a practice followed by Sunni Muslims but more than 22 countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia have abolished Triple Talaq. This mode of talaq was condemned and shunned worldwide because it is instant, irrevocable and provides no opportunity for reconciliation.
The ideal form of extra-judicial talaq recognized under Islamic Law is Talaq-a-ahasan. This requires a man to pronounce divorce on his wife during her tuhr (period of purity) i.e. at a time when she is not menstruating, and thereafter wait for Iddat period which is three tuhrs or approximately three months. This waiting time of three months has been prescribed to give the husband an opportunity to revoke the talaq, which he may do expressly by verbally revoking the talaq, or impliedly by resuming cohabitation or in any other manner which shows that they continue to be man and wife. This Iddat period may extend beyond three months in case the woman is pregnant. Then it shall extend till the birth of child or termination of pregnancy, whichever is earlier. The talaq becomes final after the completion of iddat, but they are free to marry again. There is no bar of Halala, which applies in case of talaq-e-biddat. In case of talaq-a-ahsan the man is permitted to remarry his wife a second time and also a third time, but if he divorces her for the third time then the bar of Halala will apply to him.
Halala was meant to be a punishment for the man who would divorce his wife three times as then the woman would be prohibited for him and not available for him to marry unless she married another man, actually consummated the marriage with that man, was divorced by him and then completed the iddat. Nikah Halala is derived from the term ‘Halal’ which means permissible. Thus, it was not sinful to remarry one’s triple divorced wife if she had been divorced by her second husband. Over time, Halala became the worst nightmare for women who were divorced by their husbands on their whim and them compelled to undergo halala in order to be deemed fit for remarriage with her earlier husband. This made them miserable and totally at the mercy of unrepentant, callous and unrelenting husbands.
Triple talaq allowed the husbands to divorce their wives on a whim and without assigning any proper reason. In the case of Shamim Ara v. State of UP (AIR 2002 SC 619) the Supreme Court had held that “the correct law of divorce as ordained by Holy Quran is that Talaq must be for reasonable cause.” In the case of Masroor Ahmad v. State (N.C.T of Delhi) & Another (2008 (103) DRJ 137) Justice Badar Durrez Ahmad of the Delhi High Court observed that “Reconciliation before the procedure of the divorce is of utmost importance and is in concurrence with the Holy Quran. It is of utmost necessity to follow the procedure of divorce as written in Quran and proper reasoning to be given before the commencement of the Divorce.” Talaq-e-biddat offered neither any opportunity for reconciliation, nor did it require the husband to cite any reasonable cause. Thus, it was clearly contrary to the tenets of Islam.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 declares that any pronouncement of talaq (meaning talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce) by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal, and such husband shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. (Section 3 & 4 read with section 2[c]). Thus, such a talaq will be deemed to be non-existent and devoid of any consequences for the woman. The law further protects the rights of such woman by providing that she shall be entitled to custody of her minor children and receive an amount of subsistence allowance for herself and her children from the husband. In the event of his going to jail, she may recover such amount from his property.
The declaration of triple talaq has been made a cognizable offence, but the right to register complaint in such cases has been given only to the woman upon whom talaq is pronounced or by any person related to her by blood or marriage. The offence has also been made non-bailable and requires the woman to be compulsorily heard in such matters. Bail shall not be granted to a husband accused of pronouncing talaq-e-biddat under this law unless the court, after hearing his wife upon whom such talaq has been pronounced, is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for granting him bail. The offence has also been made compoundable at the instance of the woman. Thus, if she wants, she may enter into a compromise with her husband, with the permission of, and according to the terms and conditions determined by the magistrate. The law has specifically allowed the woman to prosecute her husband in such cases and expressly ruled out the involvement of any outside person in such cases acknowledging the private nature of the crime. Sections 198 and 198A of the CrPC deal with prosecution of offences against marriage given under the IPC, but this law has a non-obstante clause which excludes the application of those CrPC provisions in cases of talaq-e-biddat.
After the enactment of this law, Muslim women are upbeat and looking forward to criminalizing of bigamous marriages and outlawing the practice of Halala. Maybe this will pave the way for a Uniform Civil Code in the near future. India is a secular country, we have personal laws (Religion based) that govern us in matters of marriage, divorce, maintenance, inheritance, adoption, guardianship, succession etc. But, the Constitution is above all and no law, that is unconstitutional, that violates the basic human rights of our people, can be, or should be allowed to continue. Prior to 1955 polygamy was not prohibited among Hindu’s too. There was an uproar when Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 had declared Hindu marriages to be monogamous. Such a move should not be seen as being against any religion. This is about protecting the human rights of women, granting them a respectable and equal status within the institution of matrimony. Enactment of law is a positive and laudable step, but awareness and social acceptance are crucial for its successful implementation. Let us embrace the winds of change whole-heartedly.

From neutralisation of Article 370 to triple talaq, how does the opposition deal with the agenda of the ruling camp?
There are a number of areas that Congress should focus on. We must continue to be a strong and constructive opposition, offering an alternative narrative of our own, calling for an inclusive India. We need to also explore pragmatic coalitions to strengthen the anti-government space. At an ideological level, we must not make the mistake of allowing the BJP to monopolise the nationalist narrative. Congress must proudly articulate its own nationalism, even in the face of the bigoted polarising agenda that the present regime seeks to promote, and remain vigilant on security and foreign policy issues that could be mishandled by the BJP government. Our nationalism is inclusive, a distinct contrast to the divisive “Hindi-Hindutva-Hindustan” agenda that is dividing the nation. And finally, we must articulate a vision for the future that embraces the aspirations of India’s majority – the young. They need to hear what we can do for them, especially in areas where the Modi government has so far failed them, like education, skill development and job creation. We need to implement policies in these areas in the states we rule and then advocate them at the Centre.
How does Congress deal with forthcoming issues like Ayodhya or Uniform Civil Code?
I don’t think the problem in either of these situations is necessarily the issue in itself but in its implementation. The UCC, for instance, was even considered by Jawaharlal Nehru to be a good idea in principle, but one that can only be implemented by taking all communities along. If it were to be imposed without consulting all stakeholder groups and purely as part of a larger communal agenda (as has been the case on multiple occasions with the present ruling regime), then it will be resisted at all costs. The stand that I believe that Congress should and will take goes beyond individual issues such as Ayodhya, UCC or even triple talaq and the abrogation of 370. We believe in an India where all voices matter and should be heard. Which goes to say that when forces unleashed by the present regime seek to undermine the founding principles of this idea of India, whether it is with Ayodhya or UCC or any other issue, we must reject and resist these forces.
Do you think these issues could again trigger disarray in Congress as Article 370 did?
With regard to Article 370, I am not prepared to concede that the different opinions that were expressed within the party were a source of weakness or disarray. We are not hostage to the same kind of insecurity that is evidently present in the present ruling regime, where the whiff of a dissenting opinion is seen as a threat to the duopoly of the Modi-Shah regime. The manner in which it was implemented, the way our own fellow citizens were overnight clamped down upon by their own government, does not bode well for the future of our country.
 Do you think there is a way out of the post-2014 polarised polity?
I do believe that Congress can offer the country a way forward from and beyond the politics of polarisation practiced by the BJP. There simply exists no other national alternative to the domination of the ruling dispensation – either in terms of a pan-Indian presence or in terms of the core ideology that animates it – other than Congress. I would welcome a continued emphasis on our economic arguments. The cracks caused by economic and fiscal ineptitude are not just showing but threatening to break out into an all-out eruption.
Tactically, has frontloading of critical political issues, triple talaq and 370, by BJP in its second tenure caught the opposition by surprise?
I do believe that the return of the BJP at the helm of government and the breathtaking speed with which it has subsequently introduced and cleared far-reaching legislation such as the RTI (Amendment) Bill, the UAPA Bill, triple talaq legislation and the abrogation of Article 370 during the last session of Parliament, have presented a fundamental threat to the future of our democracy. All this was done without constituting any Parliamentary Standing Committees, so that a record number of Bills were pushed through with only minimal parliamentary scrutiny. Far more worrying, however, is the remarkable shift in pace in the ruling party’s ambition from their first innings to their second. They have gone from whispering about changing the Constitution to openly undermining it and from asserting control over independent national institutions to openly using them as instruments of their political agenda. The Opposition has largely been united in their rejection of these forces that the government seeks to compel all Indians to follow.

     Shashi Tharoor and his Ghandy Congress party's agenda is an 'inclusive' India without Hindus, or Hindi. That is their sadistic definition of inclusion! He falsely accused the Modi government for wanting to create a Hindu Pakistan. However, Mr. Tharoor actually wants to create another Muslim Pakistan in India. The only reason he wins election in Kerala is because the minority is in majority there who they are managing to fool. So why should he care about Hindus? Hindus are meant only for dividing and looting and being treated as second class citizens in India. That is what the Ghandy Congress and its slaves want to do. He presents a demeanor of being very educated and 'liberal'. Could the interviewer have asked Tharoor why he and his party never raised their voice against polygamy practiced legally my Muslims in India?...  Read More

When the time came for his replacement to be appointed, there was a difference of opinion among the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, not just on the choice of incumbent but on the system itself. The Soviet Union, under Nikita Khrushchev, suggested the office be shared by a troika of three secretaries, one representing the Western powers, one representing the Communist bloc, and one from the neutral non-aligned nations.
The Western powers under America’s President Kennedy pointed out that a troika was the Russian term for a team of three horses pulling a wagon or a sled. Kennedy noted that the Russian three-horse troika did not have three separate drivers, each wanting to take the vehicle to a different destination.
“To install a triumvirate or any panel or rotating authority in the UN administrative office (of Secretary-General) would replace order with anarchy, action with paralysis, confidence with confusion.” Kennedy stated.

However, Kennedy was able to change the Soviet Union’s stand by presenting its foreign minister Andrei Gromyko with a book of Russian fables by Ivan Andreevich Krylov. One of Kennedy’s speech-writers Ted Reardon had brought to his notice a copy of the book at the suggestion of Walter Besterman, a staff assistant to the House Judiciary Committee, who remembered Krylov’s fables from his childhood in Poland. Besterman showed Reardon a story in verse in the book where the poem narrated the comic chaos of what happened when a troika of a swan, a crab and a pike (a fish) attempted to pull a wagon.
In translation, the poem said, ” When partners with each other don’t agree/ Each project must a failure be,/And out of it, no profit come but sheer vexation./A Swan, a Pike and a Crab once took their station/In harness, and would drag a loaded cart;/ But when the moment came for them to start,/They sweat, they strain, and yet the cart stands still;/What’s lacking?/The load must, as it seemed, have been but light;/The Swan, though, to the clouds takes flight,/The Pike into the water pulls, the Crab keeps backing./Now which of them was right, which wrong, concerns us not;/The cart is still upon the selfsame spot.”
After reading the fable, an overjoyed Kennedy immediately called his government printing office in Washington and arranged to have several copies of the book of Krylov’s fables reproduced and handsomely bound. When the Soviet foreign minister Gromyko called on him in the White House, Kennedy handed one of the deluxe editions to him, opened it to the fable of the swan, the pike and the crab, and watched him read it. “It’s a delightful little book,” Kennedy said. “I want you and Mr Khrushchev to share it as a gift. I have a special copy for you to bring to him and one for you, too.”
Gromyko burst out laughing and walked out of the room with the two copies of the book. Ten days later, the Soviet Union announced it was dropping its troika proposal and that it would offer no opposition to the selection of a single successor to Dag Hammarskjold, thus clearing the way for U Thant’s election as Secretary-General of the United Nations. This incident is narrated in detail in the book “Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye–Memories of John Fitzgerald Kennedy”, authored by two of the assassinated President’s closest aides, Kenneth P O’Donnell and David F Powers with Joe McCarhy.
In the present context of India in 2019, there is a valid concern that governance in Maharashtra could come to a standstill under the troika of not the Swan, the Pike and the Crab but the Bow and Arrow (the party symbol of the Shiv Sena), the Clock (the Nationalist Congress Party or NCP), and the Hand (the Indian National Congress or INC)?
The ideology of the NCP and the INC is diametrically opposite to that of the Shiv Sena. The Shiv Sena subscribes to Hindutva, the NCP and the INC don’t. The Shiv Sena was launched in the 1960s by the late Balasaheb Thackeray on the platform that outsiders (meaning those from outside the state, including those from south India, Bihar and UP) were not welcome to settle down in Mumbai and Maharashtra. The NCP and the INC rely on the good will of voters in all states. The Shiv Sena is vehemently against what it calls minority appeasement whereas the NCP and the Congress maintain that they believe in what they term as secular and inclusive values. There is also a fundamental divergence on issues like Triple Talaq and the Citizenship Amendment Bill. The NCP and the INC have in the past regularly criticized what they term as the fascist tendencies of the Shiv Sena.
Perhaps the one thing the Shiv Sena could agree on with the NCP and the INC is on shrilly articulating anti-BJP slogans like “Chowkidar Chor hai”.
Unfortunately, in the case of the three-party (troika) government in Maharashtra, Chori, like Charity, could begin at home. Maybe in the ministries coming under each of the three parties there will not be a standstill but some movement of files, especially in cases where there is money to be raised for party funds. Maharashtra is, of course, the richest state in India and an economic powerhouse. For the Shiv Sena and the NCP, Maharashtra is also the only state where they are in power.
But, then, a BJP-led Maharashtra government involving the Ajit Pawar-led faction of the NCP could also have been focussed on making money. One just has to go by what the BJP has said about the NCP and Ajit Pawar in the past. During the 2014 assembly election campaign, the BJP prime minister Narendra Modi described the NCP as the Naturally Corrupt Party. The BJP chief minister Devendra Fadnavis termed Ajit Pawar as one of the most corrupt leaders in India.
So what on earth induced Fadnavis to try and form a government with Ajit Pawar? The Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar experiment was aborted only when the aging NCP founder Sharad Pawar prevailed upon his party MLAs to stay with him. Even Sharad Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar has now returned to the fold.
Perhaps the only way out of these bizarre alliances (whether the Shiv Sena-NCP-INC one or the aborted Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar get-together) is a fresh assembly election in the hope that ideologically-incompatible coalitions will be replaced with a responsible government which is accountable to the people of Maharashtra.
The only question that remains is one of how long the people of Maharashtra will have to live through a period of troika-induced confusion before relief comes through a fresh election.

But the same vigour is missing when it comes to legislating UCC. For an issue festering so long, discourse has not progressed yet to drafting actual UCCs for jurists, lawmakers and citizens to weigh in on. In their absence public opinion is often shaped by ignorance and polarised views: barbs that one community is being exempted from equality before law and scaremongering on the other end that UCC will infringe upon religious freedoms. From shoot ‘n’ scoot strategies – using UCC as a convenient peg to beat up on one’s political enemies – it is now time to progress to show and tell.
The Union government is awaiting a Law Commission report on UCC pitched as a “comprehensive exercise of the revision and reform of family law”. UCC will conflict with Sharia and even the government codified laws of Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Jains and Parsis. Many women are still unable to exercise their rights under these codified laws. So the danger of UCC sliding off the reform agenda is very real.
Central to piloting UCC is consensus that religious personal laws cannot dictate or regulate matters of marriage, divorce, alimony and inheritance. Can a BJP-led government overcome conservative opposition to conceive a “secular” law that enforces complete separation between state and religion, as many Western nations have done? Those who argue this is not practicable in India suggest that equal rights for women can be achieved through legal pluralism and personal law reform. For example, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a petitioner in the triple talaq case, wants government to codify Muslim personal law first as it did for other communities.
It is not that UCC models do not exist. The Special Marriage Act 1954 already governs matters of marriage, divorce, and alimony outside the pale of personal laws. There is no reason why the age of consent, restrictions on polygamy, grounds for divorce, or rules for inheritance should differ for religious denominations. Over time the evolution of religion in patriarchal societies created unequal laws. While waiting for the Law Commission report, government and civil society can get to work to codify a UCC. The issue needs informed debate, not politicking and tu tu main main.

     India must draft common civil code. At present no body is sure how many civil codes are there for different casts, communities and regions. It is anarchy.

Speaking with Rohit E David, Shayara discussed her fight against triple talaq, the significance of Shah Bano, Rajiv Gandhi, PM Modi, politicians pandering to men – and people saying ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’:
What are the struggles you’ve undergone?
I have been through a lot. There are many who are saying now that i am a non-Muslim because i have contested triple talaq – but my difficulties started with seven abortions that were forced upon me. My in-laws used to trouble me for dowry too.
Right from the day i got married to my former husband, he used to say, i’ll give you talaq. Going through life in this way was a tremendous emotional struggle for me. I used to keep mum in front of my husband but this eventually led him to only abuse and torture me physically. By 2015, the persecution had increased a great deal.
All of these incidents had a very frightening impact on my children. Both of the kids are with my former husband now. I want to ask, has Muslim personal law ever thought of what befalls children whose parents have been given triple talaq?
I’m now fighting for the custody of my two kids, who are 13 and 11 years old respectively. I haven’t even spoken to my kids since i came to my maternal home. My in-laws don’t allow my children to speak with me.
I am extremely worried about their well-being.
Could you tell us about the triple talaq you got from your husband?
Last year, i had come over to my parents’ house in October – one day, i got a triple talaq through the post. The postal talaq had the signatures of two witnesses as well.
I then decided to take up the fight and file for maintenance.
Shah Bano got legal justice which was revoked by government then – do you think you’ll get justice now?
I know that in 1985, Shah Bano was denied justice – i have full hope that i will get justice now.
Rajiv Gandhi’s attitude to Shah Bano created history – do you have a message for Prime Minister Narendra Modi now?
I only want to tell and urge PM Modi that the Constitution should be the same for Muslims and Hindus.
It’s my request to him to completely erase triple talaq from India.
Do Indian politicians cynically pander to men, ignoring women – making them more vulnerable? 
Yes, absolutely. And men don’t consider women equal to them either – especially when it comes to the Muslim community. I can tell you that there are many Muslim women who live in fear every day of getting triple talaq from their husbands.
The men in our community fully exploit women.
I have great hopes now that triple talaq will be abolished in our country. Along with this, the ‘Halala’ tradition, which demands that if a repentant husband wants to remarry his divorced wife, she has to be another man’s wife first before a final comeback, should be repealed completely.
I want the coming generation to benefit from my verdict. I don’t want them to undergo exploitation like i have.
It is my request to all Muslim women who have got triple talaq from their husbands to come forward and fight against this injustice.
Do you consider triple talaq un-Islamic?
Yes, it is un-Islamic. In the holy Quran, there is no mention of triple talaq.
This law came into effect thanks to maulvis, who wanted to set things for themselves.
Has the time come to amend religious laws in the country?
Of course – for the simple reason that they are outdated now.
Hindu laws, when it comes to divorce, are pretty strong. Hindu women don’t have to undergo bahu vivahs or halala.
Make laws equal for every community.
Speaking of communities, we’ve heard much on intolerance in India – is there more communal intolerance today than before?
No, i don’t think the situation is like that. There is no communal intolerance between Hindus and Muslims.
What about the ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ slogan controversy?
I feel all Muslims should say ‘Bharat Maa ki jai’ – there is nothing wrong with us raising this slogan.

But some aspects leading to the verdict are disturbing","August 26, 2017, 11:29 AM  IST","Economic Times","By Jhuma Sen
Shaista Ambar, the president of the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board, had stated in 2016 that “Indian Muslim women will walk with the Quran in one hand and the Constitution in the other”. A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday, while disposing a batch of petitions that challenged the constitutional validity of instantaneous triple talaq (talaq-ul-biddat), held the practice to be un-Islamic as well as unconstitutional. This mirrored Ambar’s statement.
While the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) and the Bebaak Collective, two Muslim women’s groups that were parties to this petition, had relied on ecclesiastical and constitutional interpretations respectively to establish the practice to be patently discriminatory against women, it was disappointing to find a ‘diverse’ constitutional bench in its split 3-2 verdict unable to articulate a jurisprudence of gender justice, or evolve a framework of constitutional governance by making religion, non-discrimination and the Constitution speak to each other.
While the progressive outcome of the judgement is indeed laudatory, one can’t help but note the limited — and, in some cases, regressive — reasonings extended by the bench to arrive at its findings.
The minority opinion of Justices J S Khehar and Abdul Nazeer on the question of the validity of triple talaq found the practice discriminatory.
Yet, it advocates instant triple talaq’s protection by holding that “the stature of ‘personal law’ is that of a fundamental right”. This is truly inexplicable. Personal law is neither a fundamental right nor is it protected by Article 25 of the Constitution, which protects individuals, not ‘laws’.
Then they went on to add that personal law is only bound by “public order, health and morality” inscribed in Article 25(1), implying that instant triple talaq does not offend gender equality and non-discrimination, which go at the heart of constitutional morality. Indeed, in Paragraph 193 of the judgment, Chief Justice Khehar reasons that “it is not open to a court to accept an egalitarian approach, over a practice which constitutes an integral part of religion”. And yet, he carefully avoided establishing that instantaneous triple talaq is an essential practice of Islam, as mandated by the essential practices test itself.

Arbit, Bit by Bit

For a constitutional court to reason thus, although, in a minority opinion, that religion is ‘a matter of faith, and not of logic’, and is protected from constitutional scrutiny, is distressing. Tomorrow, if a community decides that bride-burning is a matter of faith, and it follows no logic, will a constitutional court not rise to the occasion, scrutinise it and declare it unconstitutional?
The majority opinion of Justices R F Nariman, U U Lalit and Kurian Joseph adopted different reasons to invalidate instant triple talaq. Nariman, writing for himself and Lalit, concludes that the practice is unconstitutional because it is arbitrary.
He finds the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, had codified all Muslim personal law, including the practice of triple talaq, which rendered itself to constitutional scrutiny.
He reasoned that because instant triple talaq allowed Muslim husbands an unbridled power to divorce their wives, without any possibility for reconciliation, it must be arbitrary, failing the test of Article 14 of the Constitution that mandates equality before law. Thus, arbitrariness becomes the reason for invalidating triple talaq, whereas non-discrimination based on sex inscribed in Article 15, which ought to have been the primary reason, remained secondary. One can only consider this as a lost opportunity for the court to articulate a gendered reading of the Constitution.
It is astounding that the judges did not entertain the question of non-discrimination. Indeed, the express silence on the question of non-discrimination is telling in the face of the fact that the campaign to abolish instant triple talaq is inextricably linked to the emergence of Muslim women’s activism over the last decade or so. The petitioners in this case bare testimony to that.
The second strand of the majority opinion from Justice Joseph offered a crisp reasoning to invalidate instant triple talaq as un-Islamic. He effectively reiterated multiple high court judgements leading to the 2002 Supreme Court judgement in the ‘Shamim Ara v State of UP’ case, which had invalidated triple talaq, to rule that instant triple talaq is invalid as it leaves no scope for reconciliation as required by the Quran.
What is bad in theology must be bad in law, he held. It would have been interesting to see what opinion Joseph’s ‘swing vote’ would have provided about the elephant in the room — uncodified personal laws — and whether they are subject to the test of the Constitution. But Joseph avoids the subject.
Nariman’s Point

Perhaps the avoidance stemmed from the court’s reluctance to deal with this question headlong in the decades following the infamous Bombay High Court decision in the 1952 ‘State of Bombay v Narasu Appa Mali’. In this case, the court stated that uncodified personal laws are not laws within the ambit of Article 13 of the Constitution. So, they need not be tested against its provisions.
The saving grace of this missed opportunity is Justice Nariman observing that the wrong of ‘Narasu’ could be corrected in an appropriate case in the future. One can only hope that such an appropriate case is heard in Nariman’s court in the near future.

     Despite the positive ruling, the judicial thinking of the Supreme Court judges was fragile, unsubstantiated, contradictory and even outright dangerous for India&#039;s future.  But somehow in the end the result came out to be okay.  And that is India, isn&#039;t it, all muddled but still standing!...  Read More

The PM didn’t make him a minister, so Shatrughan Sinha became a trenchant critic of the PM. He bolted to the Congress, thinking that the Congress would win and he would finally win his coveted ministership.
 
But the Congress is disintegrating. He sees no future for himself there. Now he’s praising the PM to the skies. The PM’s independence day address. The PM’s handclasp and apparent bonhomie with Trump. But will the PM want Shotgun back? Unlikely, for the PM prizes loyalty above all else.
 
Shashi Tharoor too is trying to placate the PM. But he has been trying to do so since 2014, when the PM first came to power. After Sonia spurned Tharoor for the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Tharoor has been sulking. He says one thing in support of the PM one day, then backtracks, then repeats himself. Clearly he too wants out.
 
Sonia can put him out of his misery and expel him from the Congress, whereby he will remain a freelancer MP able to join the BJP, but Sonia faces the same predicament that she faced in 2014. That time forty-four minus one was forty-three. This time fifty-two minus one will become fifty-one. So Tharoor’s fate hangs in the balance, as it has for the last five years. He wants to bolt, but Sonia won’t let him bolt.
 
Unclear though are the intentions of the old-warrior Jairam Ramesh. He has said that the Congress should not demonize Modi. Really?! Ramesh has traditionally been part of Sonia’s inner circle. Has he been shoved to its outer edges?
 
Demonizing the PM is all that Sonia has done since 2002. Demonizing the PM is all that she’s doing now.
 
Then Abhishek Singh Singhvi, Congress party spokesperson of all people, said that the PM had done some good things in his first term, such as the Ujjwala scheme.
 
Where are Ramesh and Singhvi going with their narrative? Like Shotgun, and maybe even like Tharoor, do they want to quit the Congress and join the BJP? Or are they merely speaking truth to power, in this case the Gandhi family.
 
If Rahul Gandhi had focused laser-like on how poorly the economy is doing and what he would do to better it, he might have won another 100 seats and formed the government. It was his lack of political nous that he focused so strongly on Rafale. Sonia has much more political nous than him, but she probably was pleased with the PM is a thief campaign because it ridiculed the PM. Whatever ridicules the PM makes Sonia happy.
 
Priyanka too has much more political acumen than her brother, but she probably went along for the ride out of sibling fealty.


 
Rahul’s outburst in his resignation tweet was amazing. He blamed Congress leaders for not supporting him enough to demonize the PM. And then Priyanka, in a previously-held Congress Working Committee meeting, reportedly lashed out at all the senior Congress people (barring of course Sonia and Rahul) in the room, that all the murderers of the Congress were sitting in the room.
 
Priyanka has an inner Sanjay Gandhi in her, which she would do well at most times to restrain from coming forth.
 
Mani Shankar Aiyar is the Gandhi loyalist par excellence. He is an inveterate baiter of Modi’s. Now he too has supported Ramesh’s stand.
 
What exactly is happening in the Congress? Ramesh and Aiyar cannot be expected to want to defect to the BJP. But the senior leaders are now seeing that the Congress under Sonia is persisting with the disastrous chowkidar chor hai campaign that Rahul ran.
 
In the meantime, the PM is going from strength to strength, with the abrogation of 370 (which too has rendered the Congress asunder), Triple Talaq, and of course the absolutely riveting presentation of the UAE’s highest civilian award to the PM.
 
With even Aiyar going against the party line of Sonia and Rahul, the last bastion of loyalty within the Congress has been broken. The Congress has become like a Trojan horse. Its soldiers, captive within, want to be let out and be able to breathe at the very least.

This is not a bad rule to go by when it comes to matters spiritual and temporal. That said, when there is an apparent overlap between Caesar’s and God’s affairs, some balanced judgement is called for to decide the rules of which realm should apply. At present, the courts are deciding at least three cases in which the constitutional guarantee of gender equality is at odds with the claims of faith. The practice of triple talaq, by which a Muslim man can divorce his wife by the simple expedient of pronouncing talaq — even by Skype or a text message — three times is one. The entry of women to Haji Ali in Mumbai and to the Sabarimala temple in Kerala are the other two. Except when basic temporal rights are violated, the courts should leave religious reform to evolve from within.

The Constitution guarantees equality and the freedom to profess, practise and propagate any faith. Whether the content of a religion is democratic or not is not for the state to decide, but if its practice violates any citizen’s temporal rights, the state has the duty to quash that violation. Thus, caste discrimination might have religious sanction but violates the right to equality and so is impermissible. The same principle would militate against the practice of triple talaq. But when it comes to intra-faith gender discrimination that does not violate temporal rights, should the state interfere? Specifically, should the court order the ordaining of women Catholic bishops, that men and women pray together in mosques or that Akshardham swamis welcome female presence? Just as it does not make sense for the court to pronounce on the legality of Krishna’s marriage to 16,008 wives, it does not make sense for the court to intervene in the internal customs of faiths.
That men, and not just women, should fast for their spouse’s longevity would be a legitimate demand within the faith, but not for the court to order. There is space for social reform outside the state’s ambit and the courts should leave that well enough alone.

     Supreme court has been established as a protector of justice and violation of basic human rights requires it's interference as it tends to establish bench marks with its decision. We may take centuries to finally establish a just society if left on every individual as we don't have standards to question our beliefs, and that is what a decision by an established constitutional body like supreme court does, it sets an example for us to change our prejudiced beliefs which have been effecting our societies from inside as well as from outside. If tomorrow a women is thrown out of her marriage just by saying talaq thrice , she won't just accept her fate and suffer silently,she will know that what has happened to her isn't her destiny but an act of injustice and she will come forward to fight it off....

Muslim men in India have used this ‘innovation’ to ruin the lives of women and they want it to continue the same way. Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill was introduced in the parliament by the Modi government not to interfere in the religious matters of Muslim community but to empower women by removing this distorted practice and punishing the culprits for their criminal act.
The bill was introduced for the mothers and sisters of our Muslim community, to uphold their dignity, respect and right to equality. There is no space for compromise in the instant talaq as it doesn’t leave any scope for that. This mindless practice allows Muslim men to terminate the marriage in a jiffy, leaving aggrieved woman with her children helpless and shelter less. So the only objective of this bill was, is and will be to stop talaq-e- bidat forever and provide succour to aggrieved Muslim women.
When marriage is solemnized in the presence of all the family members and friends then why triple talaq is given in a one-sided, secluded manner? This bill will strengthen the status of women and prevent their social and economic harassment. The opposition parties played double game on this issue in the parliament. They allowed the bill to pass smoothly in the Lok Sabha but taking advantage of their majority, created hurdles in the Rajya Sabha. They raised frivolous objections on the viability of the bill and tried hard to make the government bite the dust. Their clear intention was to appease fundamentalists whom they use as vote bank but little did they realize that their gimmicks would ultimately back-stab Muslim women and deprive them of long awaited justice.
When this practice was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in view of the constitutional guarantees and rights given to Muslim women as equal citizens of India, it is not hard to understand why opposition parties are playing dirty politics over this issue. Thanks to their blind support for Islamic fundamentalists, this pervert practice is still continuing unabated. Recently, two more cases of instant divorce took place in Uttar Pradesh. In one of the cases, the woman was deserted because of skin colour and in the other, she was thrown out because she demanded money for the treatment of her daughter. Such uncouth treatment with women is simply shameful and unacceptable. How can a civilized society allow such blatant injustice?
Uttar Pradesh has become the first State to authenticate the Central government’s draft bill that makes triple talaq a cognizable and non-bailable offence. Under the draft law, triple talaq given by uttering, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and WhatsApp — would be wrong or illegal and unconstitutional. The draft law, which provides for three-year imprisonment and a fine to a man trying to divorce his wife by uttering “talaq” three times, got the State government’s approval at a Cabinet meeting.
Politically motivated Muslim fundamentalists are attacking the Modi government for interfering in their religious matters but the fact remains that the proposed bill is not against their religion but the inhuman malpractice of triple talaq which according to Supreme Court infringes upon the fundamental rights of Muslim women. Whereas the Supreme Court declares triple talaq illegal, the bill provides the framework for the delivery of justice. When triple talaq is declared illegal by the Supreme Court, those who perpetrate such practice must be punished adequately and must provide compensation for their misdeeds.
Despite road block in the Rajya Sabha, the Modi government has expressed its 100% commitment towards this bill. If they really want to enact this law, they still have many options. The government can reintroduce it in the budget session after due consultation with the opposition parties. If the opposition parties try to vitiate the soul of the bill, then government can convene a joint parliamentary session to get it passed. Hope good sense will prevail on opposition parties this time and they will help government enact this historic law that empowers Muslim women.

A constant search for answers, a quest for knowledge, a starting assumption that we don’t know everything.
In a democracy parties compete through their respective perspectives on public welfare, each hoping to convince voters. In Hindu philosophy, the search is as important as the discovery. The seeker sets out to find the truth, encounters many answers, but on the brink of enlightenment is left humbled by the limits of his awareness. Even markets are about a quest for knowledge: prices are determined by supply and demand of the moment and a search for the just price.

Yet today India’s government believes it has all the answers and is the sole repository of knowledge. Self-doubt does not trouble the Narendra Modi-led dispensation, which firmly believes that it (and only it) knows what’s good for the people and, rather like Indira Gandhi’s sterilisation programme, the people have to simply be herded and goaded into obeying the mai-baap sarkar’s wishes. Any questioning or disagreement is either plain wrong or agenda-driven or equivalent to treason.
For example, the Centre’s newly enacted cattle slaughter rules have sparked controversy. They are seen to dangerously increase the use of state power, to limit constitutional liberties in the name of cultural nationalism. Centre may well claim that it’s only following a SC order but the fact is there was hardly any consultation or dialogue before an overnight announcement that has affected livelihoods and eating habits of millions of Indians.
Predictably, opposition ruled states and states with large non-Hindu populations have stormed into protest, but the message is clear: government knows best. Dissenting voices are irrelevant; majoritarianism trumps any other consideration.
On Aadhaar card too, Centre has made an ally of the courts to push its diktat that Aadhaar is a must while filing income tax returns. But was Aadhaar ever meant to be an instrument of fear or a device to dominate citizens’ lives? No, the limited aim of Aadhaar was simply to ensure better delivery for welfare schemes, not to be a regulator or inspector or a vehicle of surrendering private information.
The fact that Aadhaar amendments were pushed through as a money bill to avoid any discussion in Rajya Sabha shows that government had already made up its mind, was in no mood to listen or introspect or if need be change course. Like the religious fanatic who lives by absolute certainties, this government believes its knowledge is absolute.
On triple talaq the PM speaks of the need for a dialogue, yet government has made no attempt at spurring a detailed conversation with stakeholders. Here too government is using the courts to declare executive intention.
In Kashmir any attempt by civil society groups to push for a dialogue has been deemed as anti-national and sympathetic to separatists. When a group headed by BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha travelled to the Valley and prepared a report they were effectively snubbed by New Delhi, with the PM refusing to even meet the senior BJP leader.
Recently a group of eminent civil servants signed an open letter expressing their concern about the bludgeoning binary being created between ‘nationalists’ and ‘anti-nationals’ and the bulldozing of debate. Typically their views have been disregarded. Even demonetisation, that epic announcement that changed the life of every Indian, was reportedly decided on by a very small group; no one, not even the chief economic adviser, had the chance to disagree.
BJP president Amit Shah recently called Mahatma Gandhi a ‘chatur bania’ (clever trader). But has the BJP government learnt anything from the father of the nation, has it learnt the true meaning of his chatur-ness?
Gandhi never believed he had all the answers, his was a constant quest. From satyagrahas to non-cooperation to the sheer brilliance of gigantic mass mobilisation over a humble handful of salt, Gandhi endlessly explored, sought knowledge and tried to learn from contrarian views.
Who else but a Mahatma would invite his enemies to the highest positions, asking staunch critic Jinnah to be prime minister of India or suggesting to Nehru that another implacable detractor BR Ambedkar be appointed as head of the Constitution’s drafting committee?
Gandhi realised that the human condition is based on the words, I don’t know, I don’t have complete knowledge but am trying to know and trying to find out. In the same spirit, Hindu scriptures debate endlessly.
None other than the divine Krishna had to explain to Arjuna the need to go into battle through argument and persuasion in the face of Arjuna’s constant questions. Did Krishna simply command Arjuna to do his bidding? Did he issue a diktat and demand it be instantly obeyed? No, in Indian tradition even divinities must dialogue, debate and persuade, and listen to opposing points of view.
When a government believes that it has a monopoly on the truth, that there is no need for any course correction, it inevitably makes every differing point of view illegitimate and intolerable. It also turns its back on the Gandhian inheritance, even as it seeks to appropriate Gandhi’s charkha and spectacles for its various schemes.
Gandhi kept admitting his mistakes and kept searching for what he called the truth. Today when state power bears down on citizens’ lives in an unprecedented way, government must hark to the chatur bania’s quest and ask why exactly Amit Shah has been forced to admit he was so ‘chatur’ (shrewd). That was because Gandhi started with the assumption that he did not have all the answers and instead sought dialogue with as many as he could. It’s a lesson Modi sarkar would do well to imbibe.

He made an impassioned parliamentary defence of the Shah Bano judgment, the last such landmark case on Muslim women preceding the Supreme Court’s latest 3:2 judgment which has ruled instant triple talaq as unconstitutional, before resigning. Khan spoke to Rohit E David and Nalin Mehta on how ‘talaq-e-biddat’ violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women, gender equality and reforms in Muslim personal laws:

How do you read the Supreme Court’s judgment on triple talaq?
The abolition of triple talaq by the Supreme Court is a big victory. I welcome this verdict. I honestly feel that we are not in a position today to make a realistic assessment of the positive fallout this judgment would have on the future of Muslims.
If a divorce between a Muslim man and woman has to happen, it will take place. The real problem was that a Muslim girl grows with this consciousness that after marriage her husband can turn her out of the house by simply saying triple talaq. This was really oppressive for Muslim women. This apparent law on triple talaq had distorted the minds of the Muslim world. Now, they will see a new Muslim community growing up in India which will not have the fear of triple talaq among them.
With the abolition of this law, Muslim ladies will have the courage to report against their husbands, if they abuse or mistreat them.
Is the Supreme Court’s ruling that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women a great victory for progressive Muslims?
This is a great victory for every Muslim woman. The Supreme Court has held this decision to be arbitrary. Now, when it comes under the arbitrary category, this cannot come under the fundamental rights of a Muslim. I have not read the judgment in detail but there is six months’ time for the government to bring up detailed legislation.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been opposing the abolition of triple talaq. Do you think they are on the wrong side of history?
In 1986, their decision was different but in the Supreme Court whatever Kapil Sibal has said on their behalf, particularly the affidavit which was submitted when the arguments were concluded, is different. They have also recognised that it was an unjust practice and they want to abolish this practice.
The Muslim Personal Law Board had said that Parliament has the authority. If it wants to reform the laws, it has full rights to do so. Their new stand is totally different from the position they took in 1986.
Isn’t this decision a great step for gender equality?
Yes, absolutely. It will not only liberate Muslim women from the threat of triple divorce but it will also impart a sense of equality and empowerment.
Doesn’t this judgment by the apex court make Indian Muslim personal law more compatible with personal laws relating to marriage and divorce in orthodox Islamic countries?
Of course. Almost all Muslim countries have already got rid of this practice. Triple talaq was undoubtedly part of their practices earlier. Now, this law finds no standing in any court. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh which had the same laws on triple talaq had reformed their laws in the 1990s. It was high time, and thankfully India has done this now.
The last time triple talaq was held problematic in the Shah Bano case, it was overturned by Parliament and you resigned. Have your views been vindicated?
I don’t look at this whole issue from the view point of my personal vindication. I’m very happy that oppression and suppression which was being practised in the name of religion has come to an end.
Do you think that a section of Muslim clerics is holding back progressive reforms?
Try to understand the Muslim religion. My message is we should not hold back progressive reforms.

As someone who has backed the abolition of triple talaq, what do you make of the arguments given in its defence as a religious practice by AIMPLB?
Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it must go from India too.
But AIMPLB has also said that it will publicly boycott those who misuse triple talaq. Why does it then persist on defending the principle of it?  
AIMPLB’s call for boycotting abusers of triple talaq is not even a fig leaf because triple talaq in itself is an abuse. What pray is misuse of triple talaq? It is the same as misuse of molestation. These tactics are being used to stall the issue.
In the wake of the court case, AIMPLB’s claim that qazis will take the brides’ views on triple talaq is a charade. For years the community has been asking for a model nikahnama because in Islam marriage is a contract and can be negotiated by both parties based on gender justice. AIMPLB resisted it initially and then said let it be optional, knowing full well that that this cannot be feasible.
This is because a poor father in a village can hardly dare to ask his prospective son-in-law for a model nikahnama if it’s optional. It must be made mandatory to give women the rights that Islam accords them.
Do you think calling for a ban on triple talaq is an idea whose time has come?
The fight against triple talaq has been waged by very brave Muslim women such as Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan members. They have brought the issue centre stage. So when, in 2016, Shayara Bano petitioned the Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of the practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy, several women’s groups emerged from the community such as Awaaz-e-Niswaan, Sahiyar, Muslim Mahila Manch, Pehchan, Muhim, Parvaaz Sangathan, and, more recently, Bebaak Collective.
They joined forces and articulated a new radical politics, at once with progressive and feminist groups. It was a demonstration of the support system created by the women’s movement over the past three decades.
There is a concern that the call to ban triple talaq is a precursor to the demand for implementing a uniform civil code. What is your view on this possibility?
Personal laws of all religions discriminate against women on matters of marriage, inheritance, divorce. The framers of our Constitution believed that imposing a common civil code in the wake of Partition would create greater insecurity amongst the minorities. It was hoped that with the passage of time the need for reform would come from within the minorities which would be a better option. Unfortunately that has not happened and over the years it has become a stick to beat the minorities with, with a view to fuelling communal tension. I believe the time has come, sooner rather than later, when a blueprint of a common civil code (not uniform but common) that culls out the best laws from all religions based on gender justice is placed for a national debate.
Do you feel that AIMPLB should not be given the right to take decisions on behalf of Muslims?
AIMPLB is an NGO that is a respected body amongst some sections of the community. But to retain its position it is imperative that it read the writing on the wall and accord women equality and justice, or else it will become redundant.

     advantage of triple talaq: triple talaq is a blessing in disguise at least for some of the fair sex: consider the following (possible) tinsel town story. the husband was tricked to utter the word thrice, in the presence of his wife (of which he was unaware). as per custom, his ex-wife should be married and divorced by someone else, before he could remarry her. his friend readily came forward and duly performed the first, but backed out to perform the second, as per the plot of the dame, who hated her ex-husband and was in love with the &#039;friend&#039; of her husband. the new couple lived for very long and enjoyed their life blissfully, until they joined the almighty (by whatever name called). no girl was prepared to marry the ex-husband, and he remained single throughout his remaining life, spending sleepless nights and regretting that he did not have a second wife. moral of the story: don&#039;t be unfair to anyone, especially your better-half....

The dropout rate of Muslim girls had decreased from 70% to roughly 30%, he said. He pointed out that schemes like building more toilets and starting new gas connections help all households, and also mentioned the triple talaq law the government had brought in.
Any effort to soften the mutual hostility and suspicion between the government and the Muslim community is worthwhile at this point. But if the PM sincerely cares about Muslim women, a lot remains to be done. Muslim women are triply disadvantaged in India – on account of being female, from a minority community, and overwhelmingly poor. While the discourse often focusses on religious conservatism or personal law, attributing great disempowerment to cultural markers like the hijab, the fact is that Muslim girls need the same things other girls do – to study, work, and explore the world.
The increased presence of Muslim girls in school is the consequence of concerted policy. The Right to Education Act, minority scholarships, schemes like bicycles for girls and free sanitary pads did a lot to increase retention. Today, when these gains are being lost in the pandemic, the government would do well to widen opportunity with targeted policy. Their wellbeing is also linked with that of their families and communities. If the government cares about Muslim women, it must show that it cares more about Muslims.

Only about a fourth of the country was Muslim, and in a democracy they would be outnumbered.
Jinnah, the Ali Brothers, and others argued that Muslims had been the masters of Hindus, and would not become subservient to them. Jinnah proposed Urdu as the sole national language to the Cripps Mission, a diktat that he repeated when Pakistan was born, and which ultimately led to the creation of Bangladesh.
Today, the population of the subcontinent’s Muslims is about 600 million. Some are suggesting that the three nations–India, Pakistan, Bangladesh–should reunite. How feasible is this?

In a reunited India, Muslims would be about one-third of the population. Muslims tend to vote en bloc, so they could easily keep the Sangh Parivar out of power. The prime minister acknowledged as much in 2014 when he refused to entertain the idea of a reunified subcontinent. How ironic though that the very people who call out for an Akhand Bharat do not realize what it might have in store for them.
Hindus in India argue that Muslims here are doing fine since hardly any Muslim wants to migrate to Pakistan. Doing fine is one thing, and accepting your lot is another, although it is certainly true that many Hindus want to leave Pakistan for India. Charges leveled against Muslims are many, openly by the Sanghis, and surreptitiously, by many liberals.
One such charge is that Muslims procreate much more rapidly than Hindus and in fact are aiding and abetting in the subcontinental reunification project. Sanjay Gandhi made population control a dirty word, for Hindus and Muslims alike, and ever since then no government will touch the hot potato. There seems evidence to suggest that Muslims grow more rapidly, but there is also reason to believe that the government sanitized Muslim growth figures in the latest census so as not to cause a scare.
The second charged leveled against Muslims is that they are disloyal to India and loyal to Pakistan. As an example, during Indo-Pak cricket matches they support our neighbor. But seriously who is measuring who’s supporting who, and that too how accurately.
Then there is the ultimate loyalty test: They have poor representation in the army, not because the army is communal, but because they themselves are, not wanting to engage fellow Muslims in battle. The Sachar committee pegged the representation of Muslims in the army at around 2%, way below their overall representation in the population of about 15%.
But seriously, this is a tricky one. Many army regiments, even those with even a small contingent of Muslims have a mosque and an imam. Further, the army is not like the business sector: it’s engaged in a life-and-death fight with Pakistan, which calls its soldiers warriors of the faith. Out of the fourteen Param Vir Chakras awarded posthumously, one has gone to a Muslim, Abdul Hamid.
While that is neither here or there, perhaps there’s scope for both the army and for Muslim leaders to ratchet up representation. So-called Muslim leaders like the younger Owaisi, Zakir Naik, and Imam Bukhari, do a great disservice in this effort by sowing doubt and discord.
Then of course there’s the classic question: If Pakistan was meant for Muslims, India consequently was meant for Hindus, so why do they not quit India for Pakistan? Didn’t the Hindus of Pakistan quit the country almost en masse in 1947?
First, the founding father of the country, nor his key lieutenants, ever envisioned a truncated-India as only for Hindus. Second, most of the educated and/or rich Muslims migrated to Pakistan, leaving the poor, huddled masses behind. Until 1965, Pakistan prospered because of jute exports and American aid. Muslims still kept migrating there. But now, with the killing fields that Pakistan has become, who would even think of going there?
But counters the prosecution: If you could leave in the good times, why not so in the bad? Well, if the Karachi riots had not broken out in 1947, Hindus wouldn’t have left, and were it not for Partition’s mayhem, Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus would never have deserted their beloved Lahore. So what is sauce for the geese must remain sauce for the gander. In any case, Partition is done and dusted, and we are 70 years too late for this puerile debate.
And finally there is the forever beef question. Would any layman be allowed to chomp pork in Pakistan? So why allow people to partake of beef in Hindu-majority India, an animal that Hindus hold so close to their heart?
Hindus are largely unworried when Parsis, Christians and even other Hindus consume beef but see red when Muslims do so. Secularism is enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution, its most important page. Cow protection is in the Directive Principles of State Policy.
In the Constituent Assembly, some hindutva types wanted to impose a beef ban. But members from the Northeast stood up to protest. Beef was their staple diet. If banned, they would secede from the Union. So it was shoved under the Directive Principles, wherein lie most things that should stay still-born, or at best, flicker only dimly in the darkness of the night.
States banning beef under this cover may not be violating the letter of the Constitution, but certainly the spirit they are.
There are of course many other issues. Triple talaq, polygamy, and so on and so forth. But the main counter to the Muslim question should be: Why compare India with Pakistan? Per capita GDP wise they are still fairly similar, but Pakistan is an avowedly Islamic nation where the president, the prime minister and the army chief cannot but be a Muslim. India is a relatively secular nation where leaders can, and do, emerge from any faith.
Nations evolve. In California and Texas, there is a fear amongst whites that what they won from Mexico in war, they will lose peacefully because of the fast-growing Hispanic population. But by discriminating against a minority, one only enhances its ghetto mentality and resentment.
If Jats, Marathas, and their like can demand OBC status, when, let’s be honest, they have never been disadvantaged in independent India, why does the state quibble in giving a small share of reservation to India’s poorest community, its Muslims? Do you want them to feel Indian or not?

     the last statement is not only insane but dangerous. reservations on the basis of religion. well on that basis only pakistan was created. still, muslims should  get reservations as sc(if he is doing that work).all other reservations on the basis of religion alone can not be accepted. if muslims as muslims feel they are discriminated against,they are free to leave for pakistan....

Can a woman facing savagery at the instance of another woman at home seek relief under the anti-domestic violence law? Can a wife’s repeated threats to kill herself if her husband does not accede to her irrational demands be seen as matrimonial cruelty enabling him to seek divorce? Will the word ‘talaq’ texted on a cell phone to a married Muslim woman by her husband instantly dissolve her marriage?
To these and many other crucial questions of social significance the response of our rulers over the years has virtually been “let the courts decide.” Since independence they have been shunning their responsibility to bring about social reform and throwing the ball into the court of an already over-burdened judiciary.
A government not comfortable with the need or demand for a particular social reform can find easy ways to keep it hanging in the air. Where there is a will there’s a way, it is said — in this case where there is no will there is a survey. Eliciting public opinion, making wider consultations and waiting for initiative to come from the concerned group of citizens are common alibis for prolonging inaction. Reference to the Law Commission is a risky option since, manned by judges and jurists, it can disappoint. And if this escape route is ever used there is nothing to worry – we have a plethora of national commissions but their recommendations are not binding on the government and, unlike those of NHRC and NCM, this one’s are not even to be placed in parliament ‘with action taken or why not taken’ reports..
The present government is being enthusiastically complimented and vehemently critiqued by different sections of citizens for its “bold stand” in relation to the issues of uniform civil code and Muslim personal law, but the fact is that it has not initiated any action in either case on its own volition. The reference of the uniform civil code issue to the Law Commission in July this year and the affidavit on Muslim divorce law filed in the apex court last week have been in response to judicial concerns. In October last year a bench hearing a case under Christian law had – in an implicit reference to the ruling party’s advocacy of a uniform civil code before the polls – asked the government “what happened to it, if you want to do it then why don’t you frame and implement it.” The government’s rejoinder was “it is a very sensitive issue and needs wider consultation” – and eight months later it referred the issue for that purpose to the Law Commission.
Quite often questions whose answers are already given, unequivocally, in the constitution of the country are posed by the governments to the apex court. Early this year some divorced Muslim girls challenged constitutional validity of certain aspects of their misinterpreted and awfully misused personal law, and various organizations within the community intervened to support or oppose them.
Clubbed together, all these matters are now under hearing. As the state is the opposite party in all these petitions, the court as per procedure directed the government to file its reply within a stipulated time, which it did last week. This is being hailed with zeal, and opposed with vehemence, by different sections of the society. Both are wrong, as the government in fact had no other option — saying “no comments” was not permissible under judicial process and avoiding any reference to the constitution in the reply would have been legally questionable. What was said in compliance with the court’s direction to reply to the petitions was by compulsion of law and procedure and not an eclectic choice.
“The fundamental question for determination by this court is whether in a secular democracy religion can be a reason to deny equal status and dignity available to women under the constitution of India” said the government in its reply, but this question is already answered in the constitution in no uncertain terms. In Part III relating to fundamental rights Article 25 which provides for the right to freedom of religion says at the outset that this freedom will be available to the people subject, inter alia, to “the other provisions of this Part” — and those “other provisions” include the right to equal protection of laws and gender justice.
Article 25 further says that religion will not come in the way of social welfare and reform. This is not meant just to shield the custodians of state authority if they ever muster courage to enact a law likely to outrage bigots — it overtly casts a fiduciary duty on them to make laws for this purpose without being scared stiff by irrational religious sensitivities and idiosyncrasies in the society. But who cares? All ruling parties opt for a total dereliction or calculated selectivity in this regard, guided always by their political interests.
The constitutionally mandated job of providing for social welfare and reform is to be performed by the executive organ of the state through its legislative counterpart. The third organ of the state, the judiciary, is not primarily responsible for it. Ordinarily, judges have to interpret and not make the law, but are often driven to that job by endless inaction on the part of the other two organs of the state.
Former chief justice of India RC Lahoti once referred to the three organs of the state as “pillars of democracy serving the society” and added that “an obligation is cast on one pillar to be ready to additionally bear the burden if another pillar becomes weak or for some reason or the other is unable to bear the weight.” In the matter of social welfare and reform — especially in the case of minorities — the judiciary often finds it imperative to bear such additional burden. It amounts not to excessive judicial activism or overreach but to discharging a constitutional obligation.

The recent Supreme Court verdict making instant triple talaq illegal is a big step towards ensuring gender justice. But those who claim it will swing Muslim women votes to the BJP may be way off the mark.
The Congress had gone against the Shah Bano verdict to please Muslim clerics and prevent the loss of votes of Muslim men. Despite that, most Muslim women continued to vote for the Congress. They were guided by the opinion of men in their family. In many cases, the diktat of the patriarch on which party the family should vote was impossible to defy.
Three decades have passed since, and Muslim women are freer to make their own decision as to which party they would vote for. But it would be naïve to believe that they will vote for the BJP only on the basis that the party backed the cause of banning instant triple talaq.
For starters, the BJP may be seeking more credit than is due for the verdict. Second, it does not have a very impressive record as far as pushing for gender justice goes.
The battle against instant triple talaq was fought mainly by Muslim women who went to court against the practice. The BJP played cheerleader. Later, the party hailed the verdict as one that would ensure gender justice in Muslim families. The BJP saw an opportunity of getting additional (Muslim) votes.
It is not just Muslim men who closely follow the issues the BJP espouses; Muslim women, too, who are impacted closely track the BJP on such matters. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the ‘Shamshan vs kabristan’ (crematorium vs cemetery) issue at a rally in Fatehpur during the Uttar Pradesh election campaign in February, both Muslim men and women bristled.
Many have cited Modi’s raising the issue of instant triple talaq during the same poll campaign having swayed the Muslim women vote in western UP for the BJP. While the party itself has doubts about this claim, the issue did serve to polarise the electorate.

A liberal, educated Muslim woman will be more independent in deciding whom to vote for. The views of male family members may influence them to a lesser degree. This electorate is likely to also think about the BJP’s stand on gau raksha (cow protection) lynch mobs and other matters that can affect it before casting its votes.
Instances of instant triple talaq are not high. However, it is not just opposed by Muslim women affected by it but also by liberals, including liberal Muslims. According to rough estimates, only 2-3% Muslim women vote for the BJP. Mostly Shias have been inclined towards the party to some degree. They have never practised instant triple talaq.
All parties, be it the Congress or the BJP, should take up this issue primarily as a fight for gender justice. Although the Congress has supported the Supreme Court verdict in the case, its own attorneys-cum-politicians fought the court battle against the criminalisation of the instant talaq.
This makes its stand nebulous. Muslim women still do not have equal rights to divorce. A Muslim man can divorce his wife over three months. Khula, the Muslim woman’s right to divorce, does not compare with talaq-e-hasan or talaq-e-ahsan, which still gives the man far more powers than to a woman.
The BJP needs to work more to ensure gender justice and equal rights for all women. Sadly, most of the time its leaders are obsessed about the uniform civil code rather than looking at problems that women face per se. If the party is sincere about gender rights, the BJP should also work to ensure these rights are also delivered to non-Muslim women, Hindus included, on matters of education, inheritance, rights over children, and marriage (involving dowry, etc).
The BJP should not commit the mistake that the Congress did of being guided by vote-bank politics while dealing with the rights of Muslim women. It should fight for gender justice for all women, irrespective of their religious persuasion.

The conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for rape is no less momentous than the recent Supreme Court judgements banning instant triple talaq and upholding privacy as a fundamental right. While the latter are historic in their sweep, the import of putting a cult leader with enormous political, social and financial clout behind bars for 20 years should not be underestimated.
The verdict is a trendsetter on two counts. One, it destroys the aura of invincibility surrounding cult leaders who take advantage of the blind faith of their followers to camouflage the sleaze that passes off as spiritualism behind the cloistered walls of their ashrams. The CBI court judge has affirmed that no one, not even a godman, is above the law.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-91901"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/graph.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""439"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/graph.jpg 630w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/graph-300x209.jpg 300w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/graph-52x36.jpg 52w"" sizes=""(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"">
In the process, he has struck at the nexus between cult leaders and the political class that nurtures and protects them because of the vote bank they offer in their huge followings. Elections have become so competitive that politicians and political parties have no compunction about cultivating thugs, criminals and charlatans to stack up vote blocs to get to the winning number.
Two, like the instant triple talaq judgement is for Muslim women, the Ram Rahim verdict is hugely empowering for women followers of shady cults and sects. These women, many of whom renounce the world at a young age to become devotees, often at the behest of their families, are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse. And they have no recourse for justice because of intimidation by the head of the cult, as well as their families.
Let’s not forget that the case against Ram Rahim was based on an anonymous complaint from one of his victims.
Despite repeated pressure from leaders across the political spectrum, investigators and the court chose to believe her version of events rather than Recounting the day she was summoned by Ram Rahim to his bedroom, the victim quotes the Dera chief as saying that she had dedicated her wealth, body and soul to him when she became his disciple and he had decided to “accept her offering”.
Her letter say she had a revolver on his pillow, and when she resisted his advances, he threatened her and her family with his political clout. She goes on to say that to the outside world, they may look like devis but they were living like “harlots” inside the Dera. When she sought help from her family, she was rebuked because of her parents’ great faith in Ram Rahim. The stiff sentence for Ram Rahim, and the tough talk against government and political leaders by the CBI judge as well as judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court, will hopefully embolden other victims of sexual offences to seek justice for themselves the way these two heroic women have done.
Two more cult leaders are in prison on rape charges, Asaram Bapu and Swami Nithyanand. Like Ram Rahim, they too boast of powerful political connections. The conviction of the Dera chief raises hopes for an honest and speedy trial in these cases too.
It is unfortunate that we had to witness a bizarre degree of political indulgence towards Ram Rahim even as he stood convicted. If leading lights of the state administration appeared as protectors and apologists for the cult leader, there was also absolute silence from the Opposition and other parties on the sheer courage of the two victims who chose to speak out under great pressure and danger.
The political class blotted its copybook yet again with complicity and abdication of responsibility.

     Of course the two ladies who pursued the case in spite of the risks involved deserve highest praise but what about others who continued to suffer and dared not speak out and continued to suffer not only themselves but joined Baba to make others his prey.

Reflecting the ideals and promises of a political party, a manifesto gives a vision for the future which can be realised through a partnership of the party’s leadership and the people. Despite the lofty promises made in a manifesto, people do not read it in isolation but relate it to the party’s performance in the past. Promises can be made, but they have to be delivered in order to win the trust of the people. The Bharatiya Janata Party, under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, strongly believes that this sacred document should be a “Sankalp Patra” wherein the commitments made are visionary yet implementable.
This time too we have presented our Sankalp Patra to the people where we have promised a “Sankalpit Bharat, Sashakt Bharat”, implying a “Committed India and a Strong India”. However, this effort marks a major shift in the way manifestos are prepared, by connecting with over six crore people, thereby transforming it into Bharat ke Mann ki baat.
The BJP manifesto also establishes a strong link with commitments made in the past, and gives a report card on the government’s performance in all sectors. PM Modi writes that the Sankalp Patra gives “a glimpse of the challenges of the yesteryears, the indomitable efforts made by 130 crore Indians to overcome those challenges and our collective vision for the future”. It narrates the success story of a nation, which accomplished in five years the promises left pending for 60 years due to misgovernance.

Whether it be basic necessities like toilets, healthcare, bank accounts, housing, gas connections and electricity for welfare of the people or affirmative reservations for the economically weaker sections of society – all of these have been about ensuring holistic development. The last five years have been about laying the foundation stone for a superstructure. We are now well on the way to achieving it.
We have given the cleanest government ever and created a corruption free environment. Be it in the fair auction of coal blocks and spectrum, or delivery of government services through Direct Benefit Transfer. We have shown how 100 out of 100 rupees can reach the rightful beneficiaries. The taxpayers are assured that their taxes are being put to good use in the uplift of weaker sections of society, and not ending up in the pockets of a few. This legacy will further strengthen as it becomes the norm rather than a novelty.
On the other hand, we have the opposition promising the moon with neither any previous history of results nor any path or intent to deliver. I was seven years old when I heard the slogan of Garibi Hatao by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Then at the age of 21, I vividly remember Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi saying that out of every rupee spent by the government only 15 paise reaches the poor.
At the age of 40 I heard the same family say, “Congress ka haath, Gareeb ke Saath.” Today, I am over 50, and their latest slogan is Nyay for the Gareeb. The country is tired of empty slogans. The real Anyay was when one family misled the people for over 55 years and never delivered. It fell upon us to even deliver promises in their manifestos whether it be electricity for all or reservations for the economically weaker classes.
In our Sankalp Patra, we have committed to spend about Rs 100 lakh crore on infrastructure development over the next five years. As the world’s fastest growing large economy we have an appetite for investment and if we continue to increase capital expenditure we can surely achieve our target. The Rs 100 lakh crore will help create the best possible infrastructure – roads, electricity, railways, electric vehicles, defence, healthcare, education, gas, water and irrigation, etc. Most importantly, it will give rise to massive employment opportunities for our youth both as job seekers as well as job givers.
Our motto is “India First”, and the first chapter of our manifesto speaks about strengthening the nation. The fight against divisive forces continues and we are confident the people will support us against terrorism. We are delivering “sabka saath, sabka vikas”.
We have made commitments to every sphere of society – doubling the incomes of farmers with massive investment; empowering our aspirational youth with education, skills and livelihood opportunities; greater participation of women in public life through reservations in state assemblies and Parliament; ensuring dignity for Muslim women by abolishing triple talaq; dignity and justice for Dalits, tribals and backward classes; lower taxes for the middle class; ease of doing business for startups; a safety net for small shopkeepers and traders in their old age with a pension scheme; and infrastructure for the urban areas and rural areas.
Finally, the manifesto lists out 75 milestones for India at 75 in 2022. These will transform India and cover every section of our society. As India takes its rightful place as a world leader, the people have a clear choice between a mahamilawat government with the same stale promises, or the trustworthy promises and decisive leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Two words more loaded than me at happy hour. Should it stay or should it go? Everyone has an opinion about it and here is mine. I say don’t do away with triple talaq, instead do away with marriage. Think about this – if we didn’t have marriage we wouldn’t have child marriage, forced marriage, bride beatings, dowry harassment, bride burnings and we most certainly would not have divorce.
See the problem is that both marriage and triple talaq are man-made, designed by men to serve themselves. Think about this – the average Indian marriage requires a strict division of labour. He goes to work, which can mean anything from having a job to marginal employment (aka dad’s business) to being outright jobless. Regardless of his contribution his wife has to do all the housework, look after the in-laws, have sex whenever he wants, produce as many children as she can with zero maternity leave (because housework must go on), and she has to do all this with a smile on her lips or her performance review won’t go well.  And because she gave up working outside the house so she could work inside the house she is at her husband’s mercy.
As for triple talaq i actually think it was designed by college boys because that is exactly how immature men will end any relationship – unreasonably.  Of course this is not the purview of Muslims, although you guys have carved yourselves a wee bit of a niche here. All that said, based on my Twitter research the angriest critics of triple talaq besides the feminists tend to be middle-aged, divorced, Hindu men who would have much rather screamed talaq three times in their wives’ faces.  These guys are upset that they had to deal with the law, that they have to pay alimony, and most of all that some other guys are getting away with it.
And this is why triple talaq must go (OK so i changed my mind). In a culture that is skewed to giving men a better deal the fact is they will act like college boys if they aren’t being watched. Men are clearly not hard wired to do the right thing by their women and so the law has to make them do it. Here is hoping it will. And once we sort this out we can come back to banning marriage.

     the author is not a comedian, she is a twitch. there was no valid or invalid reason to connect triple talaq to college boys or every man out there. it&#039;s the mistake of women that they were worthless enough since ages to only be treated as a property, neither they did any role in the evolution of the society nor contributed to any major technological or scientific changes that would have fetched them a dignitary place through the historyit doesn&#039;t take 10 millennia to realize that you&#039;re also a human with your own identity and own rights. women got subjugated because that&#039;s what got them wealth, position and pleasure from their masters. they were the reason patriarchy exists, you should blame your own female ancestors for this, not the men. men did everything to evolve the society so eventually they took everything in their hands.nowadays girls themselves are dying to marry because that&#039;s the only way they have to get easy money &amp; comfort without doing anything, as they used to do since ages. college girls see their boyfriends as a career option, richer he is, more settled she gets.you should write following the present trend of the society, not by the middle ages....

On Tuesday a divided five judge Constitutional Bench of the Court declared triple talaq unconstitutional – a verdict that the Union government argued for and welcomed. On Thursday, a unanimous nine judge Constitutional Bench declared that all persons in India have an inalienable fundamental right to privacy. The Union government precipitated the formation of a nine judge Bench and argued vehemently that no such right existed.
As things turned out Chief Justice Khehar, who retires this weekend, will do so with the satisfaction that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed its commitment to protect fundamental rights with a resolute 9-0 verdict. While the court was unanimous it still took 547 pages to spell out its position. While Justice Chandrachud carried three other judges with him, five judges concurred but wrote separate opinions.
So the court delivered six separate opinions and decoding the plurality to ascertain the majority view on several points of law is likely to engage lawyers, law students and legal academics well after Chief Justice Khehar has retired. I will present here the key findings of the court and indicate where there are different views on these issues.
All judges agree that privacy is a fundamental right in the Constitution. Justice Chelameswar makes it clear that while the text of the Constitution does not expressly provide for such a right it may be implied from the phrase ‘personal liberty’ in Article 21. Justice Chandrachud and others go further to locate this privacy right in a holistic reading of Article 14, 19 and 21. Justice Nariman is very precise in locating the three dimensions of privacy in three different configurations of constitutional articles: privacy of the physical body in Article 19(1)(d) and (e) and Article 21; informational privacy in Article 21 and privacy as personal choice and autonomy in Articles 19(1) (a) to (c) and Articles 20(3), 21 and 25.
While such a listing may appear to be legal arcania, this is evidence of the depth of the court’s commitment to the protection of the scope and content of the privacy right. When legislation is challenged for a privacy violation it’s constitutional provenance that will determine its relative priority to other constitutional values as well as the exceptions and limitations to the right.
The scope of the privacy right varies between the various opinions. Justices Chandrachud and Nariman sketch out a fully developed privacy right that protects individual data and information from state and non-state actors, personal autonomy and intimate personal choices as well as the protection of personal dignity wherever that may be infringed. Together they form a majority view on the scope of the privacy right.
They also agree that model of constitutional interpretation and conclusions reached in the infamous ADM Jabalpur emergency detention case needs to be expressly overruled so that such view may not be resurrected in Indian constitutional law and politics. They were at pains to clarify that such a privacy right was not the obsession of the wealthy and privileged – an expression of post-materialist values – but was at the core of the protection of the autonomy and dignity of the poorest citizen of this country. They understood privacy to be a foundational value – the core of a liberal Constitution – on which the constitutional values of dignity, fraternity and liberty could be achieved.
The rhetorical and legal force of these conclusions would leave most observers curious about the radiating effects of this opinion. What does this decision mean for the Aadhaar case and the Koushal case which was discussed in oral arguments? While the judges did not decisively rule on the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar law and remanded the case back to the Constitutional Bench set up for this purpose, at least four judges took a view that would shake the constitutional defence of Aadhaar.
Justice Chandrachud, who spoke for four judges, was clear that the only limitations that could be imposed on privacy were on national security, criminal enforcement and welfare distribution grounds. While the tenor of Justice Nariman’s views would raise similar doubts on the constitutional validity of Aadhaar he did not express this unequivocally.
At least six judges took the view that the privacy right protected individual choices and autonomy on intimate personal choices. Justices Chandrachud and Kaul expressly referred to the Koushal case and were clear that the case was wrong to the extent that it did not pay adequate attention to the privacy right. Justice Nariman’s endorsement of the core value of personal autonomy and choice to be the foundation of all constitutional rights and values leaves little manoeuvring room for the five judge bench that will review this case shortly.
Justice Khehar inherited a court that was locked in two simultaneous battles: with the executive over judicial appointments and its hostile approach to constitutional litigation represented by the previous belligerent Attorney General. Secondly, there was an unresolved internal battle over the collegium process with dissension and dysfunction. With the decision in KS Puttaswamy, Justice Misra will receive a court that has rebuffed executive government belligerence and resolved internal dissension to the extent that Justice Chelameswar and Justice Khehar both endorse a robust constitutional right to privacy. It will now be his turn to protect the court and guide it through the creeping majoritarianism of our times.

Muslim men who use the abomination to impose a spirit-crushing misogynist shackle on women will go to jail. Even the Islamic faith, as argued by the NDA in the Supreme Court in the context of the Shayra Bano case, declares this practice a “sin.” Leading Muslim rights activists will tell you that a Muslim man who expediently spells out the three odious words to consign his wife to a life of abandonment can be condemned to a 100 lashes under Shariat. In other words the bill, which has now become an Act of Parliament, makes a breach of religious morality punishable through the agency of the Indian Penal Code. But as Faizan Mustafa, VC of the National Academy for Legal Studies and Research, argues the “law is dictating to the orthodox Hanafi Muslim woman to continue in a relationship she considers sinful. If she thinks that, as per her sect, her marriage has come to an end, (then) forcing the continuance of sexual relations is nothing but tyranny unleashed by the law, which seriously undermines individual choice and autonomy.”
This is why some leading scholars believe criminalizing triple talaq signals an inexorable progression towards the adoption of an Uniform Civil Code. Or a future where the law of the land prevails over personal religious laws. This inconsistency points to a profound hypocrisy: The State cannot invoke faith in court to argue that the Hindus have a claim to the Ram Janambhoomi site even while suggesting that criminalising triple talaq is gender justice. In other words the State cannot be selective. Homosexuality is deemed a sin under Christian canonical law and the coda of some other religions. But the Indian State has rightfully decriminalized gay sex by watering down the provisions of Article 377. The Supreme Court said the definition of religious morality cannot underwrite discrimination as that violates the Constitution. The verdict ensured that in this case too faith had no option but to supplicate before the clear-eyed logic of law.
This principle was also invoked when the land’s highest court overruled the whims of conservative Hindu men and the high priests of Kerala’s Sabarimala temple. In the long drawn-out Sabarimala legal battle the temple’s high priests revealed in the top court that they were ordained by the Lord Ayyappa himself to ensure that he never had the occasion to lay an eye on a menstruating women below the age of 50. The defendants said that Sabarimala’s resident deity could not afford to be tempted by the guiles of such women thus they shouldn’t be allowed to enter the shrine. Women activists raged against this injustice. The Apex court, once again, sided with the women, thereby refusing to sacrifice the imperative of gender justice at the altar of religious belief.
The arguments used to push through the Triple Talaq Bill and the logic the State employed to ensure the ‘progressive’ verdicts in the Art 377 and Sabarimala case have set a durable precedent. Now, when the Supreme Court has agreed to conduct day-to-day hearings in the long pending Babri Masjid-Ram Janambhoomi case, how can the State ignore its own activism? It can hardly justify its defence of Hindu claims on the disputed site by falling back on the imperative of belief without sounding partisan.

     The writer needs to urgently read and educate himself, Sita Ran Goel's monumental research work - "" Hindu Temples : What Happened to Them : The Islamic Evidence - Vol - 2 "". The writer also appears to be ignorant of the fact that the Muslim side represented by the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee had given an undertaking that if ' it can be proved conclusively that a Hindu Temple pre - dated the Babri Masjid at the very same site, the AIBMAC will withdraw all claims to the site '. This is quoted in the Affidavit given by the Narasimha Rao Govt. to the Supreme Court. The judgement of the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court of 30 Sep 2010, clearly proves that a LARGE Hindu Temple pre dated the Babri Masjid at the same site. Yet the AIBMAC has gone back on its words. And, the secular Macaulay English media will blissfully sidestep that issue and delve into irrelevant aspects like Triple Talaaq, Sabarimala etc. Balderdash...

The Maharashtra government too endorses this stand. It should now enforce the rule of law and ensure that the gates of the Shani Shingnapur temple in Ahmednagar, among others, are open to women. Meanwhile the Supreme Court has decided to hear a plea by Shayara Bano, a Muslim woman from Uttarakhand. This will be a litmus test of whether gender discrimination, on the basis of patriarchal interpretation of religion, can be permitted in India.
Bano’s petition argues that divorce through triple talaq should be declared unconstitutional as it allowed some Muslim men to treat women like “chattel”. In response to the Supreme Court’s directive, the Centre will have to place before it the report of a high level UPA-era committee which sought a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq, as well as polygamy. Commissioned by the ministry of woman and child development in 2012, the report recommended specific amendments to the Muslim Marriages Act 1939 and suggested mandatory maintenance to the wife and children in cases of divorce or separation.
These recommendations are sensible and must be accepted. Triple talaq has after all also been banned in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh. While religious freedom must be protected, personal laws must also conform to minimum standards of justice and fair play. Vice-President Hamid Ansari wondered aloud last Saturday “whether a more complete separation of religion and politics might not better serve Indian democracy”. While the wider demand for a uniform civil code needs broader consensus and debate as well as a conducive and non-threatening atmosphere, equality for women in all religions should be non-negotiable.

The Union cabinet on Thursday approved the inclusion of provisions of restricting the right to register a police complaint against husband, to only wife, her blood relations and her in-laws. It also allowed the provision of conditional bail and reconciliation between the couple. All the amendments ensure that the law will not be misused while victims get due justice.
Introduced after the landmark 3-2 verdict of the Supreme Court against the tradition of triple talaq, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, could not have been unassailable but for the pressure mounted by the opposition. By agreeing to make these changes in the bill, the government and the opposition together have demonstrated that only in a democracy there are considerable and effective checks and balances.
The bill, though passed in Lok Sabha, remains pending in Rajya Sabha where the government lacks required numbers to push it through. Now that the BJP government has made the amendments, the Congress-led opposition must support the bill on the last day of the monsoon session today and help it make it a law.
In the process, it will establish that after all the wrangling; Indian democracy functions optimally and flourishes year after year, because of the inbuilt mechanisms of give and take between the government and the opposition. But more than anything else, the opposition must stand by the Muslim women victims and show that it is willing to work with the government, for the sake of people’s interests.

"1616953535-173","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=triple+talaq","The Liberals need to win back their credibility","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/india-as-i-see-it-a-soldiers-view/the-liberals-need-to-win-back-their-credibility/","The Liberals need to win back their credibility","November 19, 2019, 3:27 PM  IST","Col N Bhatnagar","Since the time Mr Modi has caught the imagination of the countrymen and emerged as one of the popular leaders there has been a raging debate on some contentious issues like Nationalism, Ultra Nationalism, despondency amongst minorities and as a result we had an Award Waapsi episode in 2014-15 and thereafter an Intolerance campaign, as a mark of protest by those who claim to be liberals.
I do not think those who protested and have been opposing Mr Modi’s rule on these aforesaid issues gained anything substantial because Mr Modi has once again come back to power in 2019 with a bigger mandate.
It is not very difficult to identify a conservative, because he usually derives inspiration from the past, established practices, norms, customs, traditions and so on. As per the definitions given in various dictionaries, one can safely define a Conservative, as someone who promotes traditional social institutions in the context of culture, religion and civilization and they usually oppose new ideas and often seek a return to &quot;the way things were ; Shariat rule, Ram Rajaya, Caliphate rule etc.
From purely behavioural point of view, one can easily identify the Conservatives, the moment they open their mouths and at times even by the dress they wear. On the other hand, a liberal can only be recognised when he puts forth the ideas and views.
For instance, A Muslim CONSERVATIVE would normally have a beard, wear a skull cap, will speak about ; Muslim interests only, in favour of triple talaq, in favour of Burqa, about governing the society through Shariat law, dress code, Islam being in danger. Similarly a Hindu conservative would usually ; have a tilak on his forehead, saffron thread on his wrist and will talk of HINDUS’ interest, establishing Ram Rajya, following traditions and practices as written in old religious scriptures, and so on. This is applicable to members of other religious communities as well.
As a norm, Most of the conservatives wear their religion on their sleeves and their sentiments get hurt on slightest of criticism and even by cartoons. A liberal on the other hand does not carry any burden of the past. He is open to new ideas, respects and allows different types of beliefs and faiths, supports individual rights  and human rights,  democracy, secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
However, as everything cannot be categorised in this world into Black and White and will have to accept the existence of lot of grey also, hence there will be Conservatives who are a bit Liberals and so there can be Liberals also who may be a bit Conservative as well. I am for the purpose of this article addressing all of them as Liberals.
When we look back into our history, we find that Liberals have played an important role in various revolutions ; the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789, in overthrowing the tyrannous rule and ushering in parliamentary democracy. During 19th and early 20th century, it were the Liberals who spearheaded movements bringing about reforms in almost entire world be it Europe, Ottomon empire, USA and even in India reformist Leaders like Ishwar Chandra Vidya Sagar, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Harbilas Sarda put an end to old evil practices of Sati, suffering of widows and Child marriage. The democratic principles of equality, liberty, inclusiveness as we see today are an outcome of the efforts of liberals.
But astonishingly one today finds that those who are labelled as Liberals in India are doing a great disservice towards the society and at times appear to be more Conservative than the conservatives themselves. They are largely status quoists, sycophants and attitudinally have no conviction to change things around. And it is because of this reason that Indian liberals today are fast losing their credibility amongst the masses.
The reasons are not difficult to be found.
When these liberals were supposed to stand for Kashmiri Pundits whilst their Human rights were violated, our liberals remained silent and are now speaking up for the human rights of Kashmiris when Article 370 has been repealed. They were expected to oppose the unfair muslim law and support the cause of the Muslim women being tormented by triple talaq but they rather preferred to stand steadfastly in support of a status quo, despite the SC orders of 1985( Shahabano case). Thousands of innocent lives were lost due to repeated terror attacks but they never spoke out to bring about a change in legal provisions to tackle this violation of human rights of masses but they spoke out for a convicted terrorist. They should have stood for Taslima Nasreen’s and Salman Rushdie’s freedom of speech but they succumbed to the pressure of the conservatives and instead stood for the freedom of expression of MF Hussein. They remained selectively quiet or spoke selectively when some were picked up and lynched to death ; whether they were Hindus in Kerala and in West Bengal or Muslims in UP, Rajasthan and MP, as if those innocents deserved to die and shrugged off their responsibility by conveniently palming it off to respective states, as a Law and Order issue.
We can go on and on describing their spineless behaviour and sycophancy and it is this reason that the conservatives have struck back and have labelled them as ANTI NATIONALS. It is the outcome of their sycophancy and double standards, that a great liberal leader, Mr Nehru who stood for all those democratic norms that India is now known for is being blamed for wrong reasons.
The Liberals had ample amount of time and numerous opportunities in all these years, to return their awards and also start an Intolerance campaign, but they did nothing and chose a wrong time to do so.
However, notwithstanding the above, the society needs Liberals in sufficient numbers because it is they who can take the society ahead, It is the Liberals who can inculcate an attitude of scientific enquiry amongst the people, It is they who can prevent violation of human rights, it is they who can prevent those who govern, from abusing the power, It is they who can remove the obstacles that prevent individuals from living freely and enable them to fully realize their potential. It is they who can make India a pleasant place to live in. It is therefore extremely important for the well being of the society that the Liberals regain their credibility.
But for that to happen the Liberals must first have to inculcate some soldierly habits ; calling A Spade A Spade, and have to give up this habit of speaking up selectively.

“…The liberal alone can unite the country… No force can unite it except the voluntary human will. Fanatical Hinduism cannot by its nature mould such a will, while liberal Hinduism can…I do not know of a single period of Indian history when fanatical Hinduism was able to give India unity or well-being. Whenever India has been united and prosperous, the liberal in Hinduism in respect of caste, woman, property and tolerance has always predominated…”
“…Fanatical Hindus, no matter what their motives are, must break up the Indian State, should they ever succeed, not only from the Hindu-Muslim point of view, but also from that of caste and provinces… As long as caste is not completely erased from the Hindu mind or woman treated as an equal being with man, or property dissociated from the concept of order, the fanatical will from time to time play havoc with Indian history…”
“…Gandhiji’s murderer was the fanatical element that always lies embedded in the Hindu mind, sometimes quiescent and sometimes pronounced, in some Hindus dominant and in others passive… The fanatical claimed the murder was to save Hindus from Muslims, but the fact is that Mahatma Gandhi was killed because never had a Hindu delivered greater blows on fanaticism in respect of caste, woman, property or tolerance as he did…”(sic)
If you don’t read the date and writer’s name, these excerpts from the seminal essay `Hinduism’ (Hindi translation Hindu Banam Hindu) would appear to be a commentary on the sad state of affairs in contemporary India.
Socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia penned this treatise in July 1950 – three years after bloody partition of the country on religious grounds and two years after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by a Hindu extremist. But, despite the two tragedies, which Lohia described as a fallout of fanaticism, India did manage to establish a secular and democratic nation.
When Lohia wrote the essay, he was hopeful that liberalism would triumph sooner or later, but 70 years after, the war still rages on and contrary to his wish, the fanatical elements seem to be having the last laugh, pushing the society towards fragmentation.
The difference between Lohia’s time and now is that, when Hinduism is under siege with fanaticism poisoning every bit of our lives and majoritarianism posing threat to the democracy, there is no tall leader who can explain with moral authority why our founding fathers – from Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru to Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Shaheed Bhagat Singh – wanted “liberty, equality, fraternity and secularism” to be the cornerstone of our Republic and vehemently opposed a theocratic state proposed by Hindutva.
On Lohia’s birth anniversary today, a revisit to the document will help us understand not only the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva, but also why Hindu liberalism is failing and what liberals need to do to survive and defeat fanaticism within.
WHY LOHIA MATTERS
Lohia’s multifaceted life, achievements and even mistakes teach us how to protect our democracy.
As a student in Germany, Lohia saw the devastating impact of Fascism and extreme nationalism to humankind.
As a researcher, he deduced that economic models of mass production espoused by capitalism and communism were not suitable for India. Besides, both can produce dictatorship.
As a freedom fighter, he realised that independence from Britishers was not enough unless people are free from social and mental subjugation.
As a social activist, he learnt how inhuman practices and hypocrisy embedded in caste and patriarchy have degenerated Hinduism.
As a political worker, he discovered that democracy is not complete without dissent, civil disobedience and criticism and that a strong nation and balanced world order can be built only with the feeling of kinship.
As an original thinker, he concluded that democratic socialism that guarantees rule of law, social justice and individual freedom to every person is the best form of governance.
A humanist, Lohia was among the handful leaders who stood with Bapu to douse post-independence communal flames in riot-torn Kolkata and Delhi, while others were vying for fruits of power, won after a long freedom struggle.
A true patriot whose contribution in India’s freedom struggle was no less than his contemporaries’, Lohia refused a ministerial berth in Jawaharlal Nehru’s cabinet and chose to risk his life by fearlessly standing up against the bloodthirsty mobs blinded by religious intolerance.
A great dissenter, Lohia shaped Indian democracy by exhibiting the importance of Opposition at a time when Nehru had acquired the status of a demigod with a massive cult following, which, if had been allowed to roll on unhindered, may have undermined the hard-won freedom.
A human being, Lohia erred in his political judgements. He taught people to work for change with patience, but turned impatient in his pursuit for anti-Congressism and compromised with followers of the ideology that killed Mahatma. Perhaps, like Bapu, he too believed in hating the sin, not the sinner.
THE GREAT WAR
The war is raging not only between adherents of the two streams, but also inside the Hindu mind, Lohia wrote.
He said that the caste never died because Hindu mind is habitual of living with it. During liberal eras, people claim that they are against caste, but do not work against it. They are not vocal about caste by birth, but construct castes by vocations.
Similarly, liberal men indulge in vices, but want women to be virtuous. As long as law or custom and habits of thinking discriminate between man and woman with respect to property and marriage, the fanatical in Hinduism will not quite die out, he said.
Regarding property, Lohia said the sense of property in Hinduism is liberalised by its faith in non-accumulation and non-attachment, but fanatical interprets the theory of Karma in a way to give superior status to men of wealth, high caste and power.
Lohia rejected the notion that Hindus are inherently tolerant, but said the element of tolerance in Hinduism has always been stronger because it’s based on the principle of “unity in diversity” which believes that difference of opinion is to express a truth in different ways.
He also says that all these four core issues are intertwined.
WHY LIBERAL IN HINDU LOSING?
Lohia cites four major factors why liberal could not score a decisive victory over fanatical so far.
First – When fanaticism starts losing, it sneaks into liberal thoughts. As a result, liberals talk about liberalism, but the fanatical hiding in their minds prevents them from practicing what they preach.
Second – Liberalism is rich, but also lethargic and does not care about continuous splitting of the Hinduism into various sects, producing weakness in corporate living of the state, thus providing fanatical a chance to rise again
Third – Liberal had been open to thoughts within the country, but not to ideas from outside.
Fourth – The habit of thinking of an average Hindu mind with respect to caste, women, property and tolerance never changed.
Lohia also saw Gandhi’s assassination as the biggest gamble played by the retreating fanatical.
In the hindsight, we can now say that the liberal in Hindu mind was dominating at the time of independence and brought lasting social transformation through affirmative action for Dalits, equal rights for Hindu women, equitable distribution of property and rights to protect an individual from intolerance.
However, after Gandhi, only a handful of leaders worked to weed out fanatical from the Hindu mind. As “the habit of thinking” mind never changed, the fanatical survived, gradually taking control of minds and today making Hindus demolish liberal constitutional values that defined our independence movement. It has infiltrated into all sections of the society and pillars of democracy.
In politics, comforts of power turned liberal mind `lethargic’, even hypocritical. The liberal in the mind spoke in favour of women and tolerance and against caste and property to catch votes, while “fanatical within” used everything – from money and muscle to majoritarianism and from caste and communalism to crony capitalism – to retain or grab power.
On the social front, the liberal split into numerous groups. Debates were around Gandhi versus Ambedkar, Gandhi versus Bhagat Singh, Nehru versus Patel and Nehru versus Bose, forgetting that the common factor in all these great minds is liberalism. Often warring groups colluded with fanaticism to score over the adversary.
As far as openness to ideas from outside is concerned, the economic model of the West was blindly emulated, while turning a blind eye to their devotion to Constitutionalism.
The education system too ditched the liberal cause, particularly after the 90s’ economic reforms, which brought economic prosperity to a section of people, but increased inequalities and converted universities into suppliers of skilled workers and consumers for the bazaar. The decline of humanities and social sciences, left little scope for debates that once sensitised minds in their formative years. Cut throat competition for survival or for that matter fulfilling desires spared no time in life to reflect and analyse.
Such a situation produced a mindset that mistook corporate and upper-class lifestyle for liberalism. The `habit of thinking’ of an average Hindu mind never changed. It allowed lower castes in schools, but always questioned their talent. It lured Dalit voters, but never accepted upper-lower caste marriages. It advocated women emancipation, but always asked Caesar’s wife to be above suspicion and not Caesar, even though history tells us that it was Caesar who was unfaithful and not his wife. It talked about inadequacies of materialism, but commercialised religion, commodified women and monetised hate. It praised tolerance, but did not lose any opportunity to prove himself superior (right) and the other inferior (wrong). It used Gandhi’s name to get world recognition, but iconised his murderers. It took part in movements for social and gender justice, but also turned blood thirsty during communal riots, be it 1984 anti-Sikh, 2002 anti-Muslim or 2008 anti-Christian. It called for – ‘Insaniyat, Jamhuriyat, Kashmiriyat’ in 2000, but 20 years later robbed Kashmir of its identity.
With such a weak base, liberal façade crumbled in the 2010s, when `entire political science’ was fed into the Hindu mind through an orchestrated campaign. The 24X7 lessons on social and `godi’ media brainwashed Hindus into believing that liberalism is inherently corrupt and colludes with religious minorities to stay in power, which in turn break the country (property of Hindus) through separatism, terrorism and religious conversion of gullible Hindu lower castes and innocent Hindu women. The `new India’ is correcting all historical mistakes, hence those in opposition deserve to be crushed.
This explains why many of our friends, who appeared `liberal’ till sometime back, today don’t find it revolting…
When the supreme leader blesses the misogynists, and the hate mongers by following them on social media.
When Shamshan is pitted against Kabristan with an open call to “goli maron s…ko”.
When farmer and tribal movements are vilified as a handiwork of tukde-tukde Gang.
When dissent is threatened with rape and murder, even jailed without a straw and a sipper cup.
When assertion of Dalit pride in Bhima Koregaon becomes a threat to the nation.
WHY LIBERAL IN HINDU NEEDS TO WIN
Lohia believed that a country as vast and old as India with rich cultural, lingual, regional and religious diversity can stay united only when everyone gets an equal space and equitable support to prosper without losing identity. Liberalism can create such a feeling through its board outlook, but when fanatical imposes uniformity of any kind – be it religious, sectarian, racial, cultural or lingual – it always leads to fragmentation of the country, he wrote.
In other words – To live and let live is in the heart of the liberalism, while cut throat competition is the staple of fanaticism; liberalism unites by avoiding conflicts, whereas fanaticism divides by creating binaries; liberalism liberates, while fanaticism discriminates; liberalism means freedom, whereas fanaticism demands surrender of freedom; and liberalism makes one love fellow citizens and thus her/his country, while fanatical tells you how to love your country.
Likewise, liberal loves diversity, while fanatical moulds all in one format; liberal inspires, while fanatical incites; liberal allows you to take decisions, whereas fanatical takes decisions for you; liberal supports one to develop capabilities, while fanatical decides what one is capable of; and liberal provides space to all school of thoughts in a faith whereas fanatical dubs every thought against its version of religion as blasphemy.
Last, but not the least – Liberalism protects your soul and makes you a human, while fanaticism fills one with rage and hatred that destroys the soul.
* To protect constitutional democracy
Centuries of experience and experiments across the world have proven that people of a country unite willingly when they feel that the identity of every individual will be protected and preserved. However, when unity is enforced through uniformity, it leads to systematic alienation and discrimination of those who refuse to surrender their identity, resulting in degeneration of the society. Anything that generates hate, causes animosity and discriminates among people is anti-national and anti-Hindu, hence worthy to be dumped, be it a piece of law, religious scripture, social practice or political discourse.
However, today, a Hindu mind has mistaken the call of uniformity with unity. He has been swayed by the fanatical’s motto ‘Ek Desh, Ek Vidhan, Ek Pradhan, Ek Nishan’. The call gives an impression that India has separate laws for different communities and states – a major factor that is disuniting the country, hence uniformity is required to unite people.
The fanatical cites also examples of separate personal laws for religious minorities and special status (now nullified) to Jammu & Kashmir to support its argument to make Hindus believes that the liberalism followed so far has been `unjust’ to them and only `Hindu majoritarianism’ can restore India’s past glory. The `victimhood’ thus cultivated in the Hindu mind has harvested hatred towards religious minorities, while pushing aside the four core issues.
However, the entire proposition of the fanatical is nothing but deception because Hindus not only played a major role in making of the Constitution, but also have been its major beneficiary. In fact, India is already one – it has one set of constitutional values, one form of governance (democracy) and one Parliament. Also, the past was never glorious for a huge population which was treated like animals in the name of caste and the women caged in patriarchy.
Indian Constitution aims to create an equal society through equitable means. For this purpose, it allows a diverse set of laws not only for religious minorities, but also for lingual, social and regional minorities to protect their identities. These laws also protect Hindus wherever they are in minority. The Constitution also has special provisions for emancipation of Hindu lower castes and women.
These mechanisms actually unite people by providing a level-playing field to all. If today, India has a standing in the world in various spheres including science, arts, sports and defence, it is because our Constitution provides space to all in national building. Even mass movements – be it for freedom, land rights, employment and women emancipation or against caste discrimination, corruption, female foeticide and IPC section 377 – have succeeded because of participation of all communities.
Similarly, the federal structure provided in the Constitution grants unique status to every state in the union. Special provisions have been given to several states located on the country’s border and some regions within have been given autonomous status to ensure India’s security and address area specific issues.
* To prevent fragmentation
The fanatical in Hindu mind may rejoice today over the idea of Hindu majoritarianism, but he is shooting himself in the foot. The quest of uniformity will start a chain reaction wherein a bigger fish will eat the little ones. After doing away with religious minorities, the fanatical will make the group higher in numbers among Hindus to target lingual, regional and caste minorities within the community, thus leading to fragmentation of the society.
The process has already begun. People opposing CAA-NRC are called Pakistanis, farmers agitating against farm laws as Khalistanis and Hindus supporting these movements urban Naxal. Opposition to Hindi in the South and assertion of sub-nationalism in the East are dubbed as attempts to break the country. The recent law against `forced’ religious conversion is not just about `love jihad’ – restrictions on Hindu women’s freedom – but also to stop Dalit from religious conversion. Even Hindutva has two versions today – one is found in Mumbai and another in Nagpur.
* To save the country
The proponents of majoritarianism want India to be as powerful as the USA, but their actions are making the country a carbon copy of Pakistan. America is not an ideal and has supported fanatical worldover for profit. Even its own people have been a victim of the fanatical power. Racial and religious fault lines are also deep in the country. However, it is still the superpower because majority Americans celebrate diversity and liberalism. Also, all the American states have separate constitutions and flags, but the country is one because of the feeling of unity created by liberalism. On the other hand, the quest for majoritarian uniformity based on religion, sect and language has left Pakistan in tatters.
* To work for the welfare of all
The fanatical is also hurting Hindus by diverting public attention from the real issues and limiting their voting choices. When the economy was crashing, Hindus were rejoicing over the abolition of Instant Triple Talaq and abrogation of Article 370 and when prices of essential commodities were skyrocketing, they were celebrating Supreme Court verdict in favour of Ram Temple and promulgation CAA-NRC. Similarly, Covid-19 pandemic, migrant distress and Chinese aggression were drowned in divisive narratives manufactured around Tablighi Jamaat, Ram Temple shilanyas and Love Jihad. In fact, Hindus pursuing majoritarianism no longer remain Indian as preference to religious identity over country makes them guilty of the same crime with which they charge religious minorities.
* To take forward the legacy of freedom fighters
Those who justify Hindu majoritarianism by citing medieval era conflicts don’t realise that they are talking about the time when emperors decided people’s destiny, whereas today people decide the destiny of a nation. Empires that took help of fanaticism to sustain eventually crumbled. Even the concept of “a philosopher king” is now outdated.
Justification of Hindu dominance on grounds that democracy means rule of majority is also flawed. The progressive freedom fighters who fought against social, caste and patriarchal subjugation chose “social democracy based on rule of law” where every individual matters and not “democracy based on majority” where numbers reign. Today, Hindus have two choices – to remain prisoners of the past or follow freedom fighters who fought against caste and gender disparities and united people of all faiths by keeping aside historical conflicts.
THE WAY FORWARD
Lohia was convinced that only an ideological revolution – synthesis of spirituality and reality – can help liberal in Hindu mind defeat fanatical within and outside. The feeling of “spiritual oneness” – Hinduism’s best quality – that sees all life and things as one will remove inequalities, while scientific temper and secular thinking will resolve issues related to the “facts of the life” like food security, poverty, population control and equitable distribution of resources, even as the eclectic approach will help in adapting to the fast-changing world. He also believed that Hinduism is not a monolithic or political religion bound by doctrines or organisation. It is a confluence of memories, mythology, philosophies and customs, both good and evil. But, since no article of faith is compulsory, evil ones can be dispensed with.
In short, Lohia’s message is spiritualism enshrined in religion makes a man human, science helps mankind produce enough for everyone and secularism enables distribution of produce to all without discrimination. If anything in these is discriminatory, it needs to be dumped. This, if followed with sincerity, will defeat fanatical in Hindu mind once for all.
He also says that those calling themselves liberal cannot be genuinely tolerant towards Muslims if they do not fight against cast and property and in favour of women. A country cannot prosper without communal amity and unity. However, a mere political unity between Hindus and Muslim is not sufficient. A Hindu will have to emotionally identify himself with the Muslim or the Christian, not in religious practice, but by feeling their worries by putting themselves at their place. The path is full of dangers, but the long chain of action and reaction between communities can be broken only by forgiving and forgetting through this emotional bonding, he sums up.
The time has come for liberal Hindus to take up the challenge and fight the fanatical within before taking on the one raging outside.

During this period mainly the elites from each religious community be it Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Dalits, were spearheading the movements demanding political rights for their own community and each one of them wanted a slice of cake even at the cost of peace.
As a result in 1900s our Leaders had to overcome such divisive challenges in the form of Partition of Bengal, demands for separate electorate for Muslims, projected by Muslim League and for Dalits by Ambedkar and Hindu mahasabha for Hindus.. The question as to who first sowed the seeds of division is difficult to answer like the one ; WHO CAME FIRST – THE EGG or the Hen. As a matter of fact all of them were complementing each other.
The erstwhile leaders who replaced Brits worked hard and did a reasonably good job to somehow calm down the nerves of each community and although the freedom came at huge cost but they still managed to keep India’s unity and integrity intact. The idea of Freedom and realisation of Political rights took time to sink in may be because India then had a literacy rate of just 12% and people living in abject poverty and deprivation could not think beyond fulfilling their basic needs.
However, in last seven decades having risen from that abyss, our stomachs now filled and literacy rate risen to almost 79 % in urban India, the society now has different concerns and needs. We, therefore as a society have now graduated to the next level and are now seeking answers to some fundamental issues; Who We Are? What Is Our History? What As A Society We Want To Be? What are our core values? What should be our place in the comity of nations and What should be done to prevent inimical powers from harming us? What sort of society do we wish to be?
When we were struggling for freedom, the people were more concerned about fulfilling their basic needs and getting out of slavery, however, Its no more about Freedom now, the society is now more concerned about its security, its self esteem about its identity and its history.
It is therefore quite likely that once again, during this stage the society will have to face many such turmoils and challenges, like it faced in 1947, because ours is a society which is multi in every aspect. Although we have a common history but it is a complex one and at times it appears as if each community has a score to settle with the other. South Indians feel that North Indians drove them out from North India, Lower caste Hindus do not trust the upper caste Hindus who have tormented them for centuries, Hindus have a deep mistrust of muslims for obvious reasons.
Thus in such a situation of mistrust within the society, when the current Government brings out legislations like CAA and undertakes steps which are although need of the hour as far as security is concerned, it is likely that those steps may emotionally unnerve and demoralizes a particular community.
The Govt must have its tentacles always erect so that it can empathise with the needs and concerns of each component of the society.
Sadly, the Government this time failed as it could not empathise with the concerns of the Muslims and thus the successive events like ; repealing article 370, arrest of political leaders of valley who were mainly Muslims, the Ayodhya verdict which went against the Muslims aspirations, Banning triple Talaq, banning cow slaughter that lead to lynching and finally the NRC and CAA created an environment of insecurity amongst the Muslims. More so, with a crore plus netizens using social media to target the muslims, it some times appeared that muslims are unwanted in their own country.
A ruling junta that eulogises Savarkar, known for anti muslim stance, can not ride two boats, On one hand its IT Cell and some of its leaders are regularly heaping insults to Bapu and Nehruji, spewing venom at Muslims and eulogies Savarkar and on the other hand Mr Modi is applauding and citing Bapu’s views to justify his actions. How could the two go together?
The ruling party must understand that with this kind of behavior at display each action of theirs will always be viewed skeptically by the minorities. Such a Govt cannot afford to hide behind Gandhiji and push through such measures in haste. They need to win the confidence of the minorities. And if they want to win the trust of the minorities then they got to be seen walking the same road as prescribed by Bapu. We must also remember that how so ever great Bapu was, when religion became predominant and an emotive issue, even he failed to win the Muslims’ confidence. And that’s why he kept requesting people on both sides to rein in their religious sentiments but he ultimately fell to the assassin’s bullets who was driven by religious frenzy.
Therefore, SABKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS is fine as far as wining elections are concerned but significance of Religion in igniting passion and provoking violence can never be undermined and none can understand better than the BJP and RSS ; They have been using religion to mobilize support.
If Sikhs in a disciplined organization like Army could mutiny after the Golden temple was attacked, and communal riots in Gujarat can take place on the issue of a Kite, then all the above mentioned steps that the Govt has taken recently would have surely disturbed the Muslims and it was really stupid on the part of the Govt that it could not foresee all this before pushing in the CAA bill.
What is happening in the country today is because Mr Modi and Amit Shah and their entire Hindutva Brigade on Social media have not comprehended the complete consequences of what they are trying to achieve. They thought that they can bulldoze their way using majority in parliament and fulfill all their poll promises. Palming off the responsibility for this chaos on to others is not likely to succeed.
More so, when in last six years the political rivals of Mr Modi despite all their efforts ; AWARD WAAPSI, INTOLAREANCE CAPMAPIGN have not been able to pin him down, they are now not going to let this Opportunity go bye, even if they have to use Muslims and Young students as Cannon fodder.
Hence, the Government must get back to Bapu’s / Nehruji’s times and learn as to how those leaders despite all the handicaps tackled such contentious issues and ensured that Hindus, North Indians-South Indians, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis remained united, they not only got us Freedom from the foreign power but also kept the country united, for more than seven decades.
The duo Mr Modi and Mr Amit need to learn as to How did those Leaders overcome those challenges? And How did they keep the inherent divisive flock together? In my opinion what worked in their favour was that they Empathised with the concerns and problems of the people. They were genuinely concerned about the welfare of the society. If we all, that includes Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs etc empathise with each others’ concerns, these problems and mistrust that we have today will vanish and this in turn will also help us finding solutions to challenges that are connected to our security, identity and self esteem.

     India is destroying itself trying to destroy Jawaharlal Nehru.  Abrogation of 370 or CAA have been claimed to correct Nehru s mistakes.  Demonetization was supposed to unearth black money since 1947.  Liberals crying fowl now have been complicit in Nehru bashing at least by selective silence.  Even a year ago nobody thought it was inappropriate to blame long dead Nehru, let alone question the truth of social media campaign.  What goes around comes around...

"1616953064-66","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/12/?s=triple+talaq","The Congress’s idea of India exposed","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/no-free-lunch/the-congresss-idea-of-india-exposed/","The Congress’s idea of India exposed","August 20, 2017, 6:57 PM  IST","Ashali Varma","Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.
In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.
Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?
India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.
For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.
It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.
Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.
For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.
Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?

The harsh glare from such archaic practices also falls upon the Indian interpretation of secularism which excused some discriminatory and cruel customs under the pretext of respecting religious sensitivities. With Supreme Court taking up female genital mutilation (FGM) and poised to examine other customs like nikah halala and polygamy, the gap between constitutional promises on female rights and ground realities can be substantially narrowed.
FGM is a cruel remnant of medieval mindsets that sought absolute control over women’s minds and bodies. It inflicts physical and psychological scars that haunt survivors all their lives. Supreme Court has likened it to Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act provisions on sexual assault that criminalise touching a girl child’s genitals and asked why bodily integrity of women must be subject to a religious practice. While it is debatable whether FGM can be construed as sexual assault in view of parental consent, it certainly classifies as a criminal offence.
Attorney General KK Venugopal claims that existing penal provisions can be invoked to prescribe seven years imprisonment for FGM, but social evils of this nature need clear cut laws and not generic provisions to ensure deterrence. It also helps that this central government has a clear vision that discriminatory practices in minority communities need to go, a shift from earlier governments that were squeamish about upsetting arch-conservative minority leaders. However, the government must restrain itself from going overboard in its enthusiasm, as happened with the Bill to make triple talaq a criminal offence when civil remedies are the norm in divorce cases.
Persuading holdouts in the Dawoodi Bohra community who still adhere to FGM to embrace the path of reform must take priority over retributive punishment. Likewise, polygamy and nikah halala, legal under Muslim personal law, will require an approach consistent with laws of other communities if the end goal is a Uniform Civil Code. Hindu Marriage Act stipulates that bigamy is punishable with up to seven years imprisonment under Section 494 IPC while the Indian Christian Marriage Act merely prohibits bigamy without prescribing penalties. The laws must be same for men and women and consistent with the state’s goal of helping each individual achieve material progress and well being. Female genital mutilation, polygamy and nikah halala have no place in a modern country.

     It is a cruel joke of modern human civilisation that we are sticking to a number of  age old superstitions. There is no denying that every religion has much scope to  replace superstitious belief and ideas with rationality. This is an age of science.  Only the things that may stand the test of scientific truth should be allowed to exist. TGhe Hindu religion has gone many a change hitherto due to  untiring efforts of its social reformers from time to time. Still there is a great deal that looks out of fashion. But Islam is totally caught in the marshy land of unreasonable belief. Many practices like Polygamy, Halala and even Talaq is against gender equality. Even the Supreme Court has treated the Triple Talaq as changeable practice. About Halal, the less said the better.    The apex court's judgement about circumscison needs to be enforced  compulsorily. Every body has a right over his body, no matter if he is a child.Why to cut his genital giving him unbearable pain.  Does religion say this ? No religion allows inhuman activities....

"1616953920-262","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=triple+talaq","Triple talaq: divorced from all reason","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/jugglebandhi/triple-talaq-divorced-from-all-reason/","Triple talaq: divorced from all reason","December 29, 2017, 3:38 PM  IST","Jug Suraiya","The bill banning the practice of triple talaq and making it an offence which can invite a three-year prison term will confront liberals with the horns of a dilemma.
On the one hand – or rather, one horn – being a liberal entails supporting minority communities.  So, the ban on triple talaq, which affects the minority Muslim community, should be opposed.
But on the other horn, Muslim women constitute a minority within the minority of the Muslim community as a whole.  So, in the interests of gender justice and the empowerment of women, the ban should be supported, even though, as many suspect, it could be the first step towards introducing a common civil code, a move which is very much on the agenda of the BJP and the saffron parivar as a whole.
Those against the triple talaq ban, which includes a number of Muslim women, have argued that by putting in prison the head of the family, and presumably its main earning member, his wife and children will be left with no financial support.
They further argue that divorce, which comes under civil law, cannot be deemed to be a criminal act, punishable by imprisonment.  Such arguments are specious.
Firstly, triple talaq is not a form of divorce.  It is plain and simple criminal abandonment of the wife, and of any children she might have borne.
A divorce is a legal procedure undertaken after due diligence by counsellors, lawyers and courts of law.
A divorce is essentially a contract between two parties, the husband and the wife, and is mediated by legal representatives on both sides, so that mutually acceptable terms of settlement, such as alimony and child support, are reached.
Triple talaq is a unilateral and unchallengeable act on the part of the husband to cast aside his legally wedded wife with no option but to fend for herself as best she can.
Those who oppose the ban on triple talaq say that it is an attack on Islam.
Is that true?  Is triple talaq an integral part of Islam, without which that religion cannot be practiced?
In its earlier ruling against triple talaq, the Supreme Court had ruled that the practice was not, in fact, specifically endorsed in the Koran, and as such could not be deemed to be a matter of religious faith, the freedom of which is a  Constitutional right.
Triple talaq does not pose a dilemma for liberals.  It is essentially illiberal in nature and needs to be opposed by all those who call themselves liberal-minded, even if such opposition runs the risk of seeming to side with the saffronite cause.
Triple talaq is a gross violation of democracy and cannot be sanctioned on the specious plea of religious faith in a free society.

This is the question raised by the violent rampage earlier this month in West Bengal’s Muslim-majority district of Malda, where an enraged mob ransacked a police station, torched two dozen vehicles, and burned shops and homes.
The mob was protesting an obscure Hindu activist’s allegedly derogatory comments about the Prophet Muhammad a month earlier in Uttar Pradesh. Though UP police quickly arrested the activist, Kamlesh Tiwari of the Hindu Mahasabha, this did not stop demonstrations from erupting across the country. At times numbering tens of thousands, protests have roiled, among other places, Rampur, Bhopal, Purnea and Bengaluru. Many protestors demanded the death penalty for Tiwari.
Such bloodcurdling displays of piety belong in a theocracy, not in a pluralistic democracy. Their scale, spread and intensity ought to concern anyone who cares about Indian pluralism. So must the backgrounds – engineers, software developers, corporate executives – of many of those arrested recently for alleged links with Islamic State.
Bluntly put, the Indian model of secularism is floundering. It needs to be replaced by an approach that relies less on the well-worn pieties of the past and more on the reality of the world we live in today. The answer does not lie with Hindu extremists, who cannot distinguish between ordinary and radicalised Muslims. It lies in an updated secularism based on individual rights and equality before the law.
Traditional Indian secularism implicitly rests on three assumptions that may have made sense 60 years ago, but are hopelessly outdated today. First, that extremists from the Hindu majority pose a greater threat than those from the Muslim minority. Second, that Indian Muslims are always victims and never victimisers. Third, that only Muslims can legitimately champion legal, social and cultural reform within their community.
In the 1950s, the heyday of the Nehruvian project, each of these assumptions was easily defensible. At the time, only one in ten Indians was Muslim. The secular impulse – to protect a small community in a defensive crouch after Partition – appealed to the best instincts of a newly independent nation. In a rapidly modernising world, the bet that over time Muslims would discard obscurantist ideas such as blasphemy, and would themselves demand an end to practices such as polygamy and triple talaq divorce appeared reasonable.
Today’s reality is starkly different. According to the Pew Research Center, today about one in seven Indians is a Muslim. And though the vast majority of Indian Muslims are peaceful, the hoped for march towards secularisation –replacing attitudes rooted in religion with those rooted in reason – has stalled. Where once a uniform civil code for all Indians was delayed by the majority’s forbearance, today it is blocked as much by the minority’s intransigence.
The consequences of both shifting demographics and patchy secularisation play out every day in public life. Often supposedly secular politics boils down to pandering to the most fundamentalist elements of Muslim society. Think of Mamata Banerjee’s concerted bid to woo clerics in West Bengal, or Digvijaya Singh’s ugly insinuation that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh plotted the 26/11terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
Meanwhile, for the first time since Partition, an aggressive new breed of Muslimfirsters has risen to prominence. To differing degrees, Azam Khan in Uttar Pradesh, Badruddin Ajmal in Assam and Hyderabad’s Owaisi brothers represent this trend. Both the panderers and the Muslimfirsters share a commitment to defending Muslim personal law and extending special rights for the community to new areas such as reservations in government jobs.
At the same time, the international landscape has changed dramatically. In the 1950s, secularists dominated the Muslim world – Sukarno in Indonesia, Shah Reza Pahlavi in Iran and Kemal Ataturk’s heirs in Turkey. But over the past 40 years a fountain of Gulf petrodollars, tenacious religious movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Cold War American policy of pitting hardline Islam against communism, tipped the balance of ideological power towards Islamists, those striving to impose sharia law on both the state and society.
Closer to home, Pakistan evolved in a way few would have predicted in the 1950s when a relatively Westernised elite held sway. The journalist Zahid Hussain estimates that the number of madrassas shot up from 137 in 1947 to more than 13,000 today. In the Pakistan army and its notorious spy agency –Inter-Services Intelligence – India faces a foe long committed to using jihadist terrorism to keep India off balance.
What is to be done? For starters, India should replace the shaky pillars of the traditional secular consensus with something sturdier.
First, this means accepting that all extremists – not only the Hindu variety – threaten pluralism. Second, it requires recognising the complexity of inter-religious conflict. Sometimes – such as in the awful murder of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri – Muslims are indeed victims. At other times, such as in Malda or the Srinagar valley, they are the victimisers. Third, Indian political and intellectual elites need to start treating the reform of ideas rooted in sharia – such as a violent response to so-called blasphemy – as a national concern, not just a narrowly Muslim concern.
In the end, secularism makes India stronger. To save it, India needs an updated approach rooted not in sentimentalism but in reality.

As tension over religious identity grows, Heptullah spoke with Pratigyan Das about beef bans and violent attacks, the possibility of a uniform civil code in India — and her view on providing affirmative action for Muslims:
Aren’t minorities getting alienated under the NDA government?
Well, before NDA led by PM Narendra Modi came to power, there had been propaganda that if Modi comes, there will be no minorities ministry, it’ll be dissolved. It’s been a year and a half since BJP came to power. Neither was the ministry dissolved, nor was its budget slashed — in fact, the budget has been enhanced.
Today, my ministry is doing all the programmes in line with ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. The government has also rescued people from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc. So how can people make allegations that minorities are getting alienated? They are wrong.
The PM has said everyone has the right to profess his or her religion and government will abide by the Constitution.
What about attacks on Muslims and Christians?
There are no attacks on Christians now.
We’ve seen violence over beef recently — what is your take on the ban?
That doesn’t come under my ministry. Things that don’t come under my responsibility, i would rather not comment on. But such measures should come from within the community. The demand should be from within, not from outside.
What about the demand for a uniform civil code in India?
It’s for the community to decide. I believe any change or reform in a community has to come from within the community. Whenever the community agrees, this will be more lasting. If reforms are arrived at by consensus, change has a lasting impact. No reforms can be imposed — communities themselves must decide on what reforms are needed.
What is your stand on the triple talaq issue that’s been rejected by the Muslim Board?
This is part of the community’s decision.
But what are your personal views?
Once I become a minister, I have no personal views — I stick to government policy.
But as a woman, I would say that women should be treated with respect and honour. Not only does our Constitution say that, our religion also says that. Our Prophet says that women should be treated with honour and girls should be educated.
Please tell us three positive measures your ministry has taken for minorities?
We have six minorities, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists. The shrinking population of Parsis is an area of focus. Among Muslims, educational and social backwardness are major thrust areas. For Muslims, our government has given 8.5 million scholarships at pre- and post-matric levels and coaching for higher education at technical institutions. We’re promoting skill development which is area-specific and giving training under the Manas programme. We also provide loans for starting businesses, linking with PM Modi’s Skill India initiative as well.
For other minorities too, we focus on skill development and giving linkages to markets under the USTAD programme. Protecting cultural identity is another issue my ministry has taken up. We’ve initiated a programme called Hamari Dharohar. Under this, we’re trying to protect literature, etc.
Despite many government measures, why are Muslims still economically backward — and do you agree with Vice-President Hamid Ansari’s view on reservations for Muslims?
Well, after Partition, Muslims perhaps lived in a fear psychosis. Successive governments did a lot of appeasement talk but never did anything substantial that could bring them to mainstream education — and once someone is educationally backward, automatically economic backwardness follows. Job opportunities get limited and they get socially alienated.
This is a vicious circle — because they’re economically backward, they can’t afford good education. Whatever education they can get isn’t strong enough to get good livelihoods.
But my government is focussed on bringing Muslims to the mainstream — the PM told me as citizens, people are entitled to health, jobs, roti, kapda and makaan. These are basic necessities and it is government’s responsibility to provide them.
As far as VP Ansari’s remarks are concerned, he only spoke of affirmative action — now unfortunately, in our country, affirmative action is translated to reservation. That’s a mistake of our thinking.
To me, ‘sabka saath, sabka vikaas’ is affirmative action.

With Lok Sabha elections round the corner, the AIADMK and Thambi Durai appear to have toughened their stand on issues pertaining to Tamil Nadu. In an interview with Julie Mariappan , the leader referred to Modi as a ‘friend’ even while slamming the BJP for treating TN shabbily.
The AIADMK has suddenly become aggressive towards the Modi government. Why is that so?
It is not sudden. Even during the days of Amma (chief minister J Jayalalithaa), we have been pursuing our policies and ideologies which do not go along with the BJP’s. Supporting the government and supporting the policies of the BJP is different. Take GST, for instance. Tamil Nadu alone opposed it at that time as Amma took a different stand. The AIADMK did not vote in favour of GST. We are more interested in Tamil Nadu’s welfare, so we opposed many bills.
Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused AIADMK MPs of protecting PM Narendra Modi on the Rafale deal by disrupting Parliament proceedings?
We wanted to raise the Mekedatu dam issue. From day one of the winter session, we have been insisting that the Centre violated the judgment of the Supreme Court that affects Tamil Nadu. They cannot build a new dam without consulting the lower-riparian state. How could the Centre give permission to Karnataka to prepare a project report? Both the Congress and the BJP have political interests in Karnataka. These so called national parties may not be able to win even a single seat in Tamil Nadu. When we raised the issue on the floor of Parliament, neither the Congress nor the BJP gave us any assurance.
It is a regular feature for opposition parties to accuse the government of corruption. Let them discuss, but they cannot accuse us. They suspended all our MPs. Even when Union defence minister gave wrong information to the House regarding the Augusta Westland helicopter deal, I raised a query. There was no motive in it.
Why did you walk out during the passing of the 10% quota bill for the economically poor?
This is very important to Tamil Nadu, which has a long history of reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, and the AIADMK stands for that. It is unethical and illogical to have reservation based on economic criteria, where income ceiling of eight lakh per annum has been fixed. In our villages farm labourers get ?200 or ?300 a day, and their annual income may not exceed ?1 lakh. Are they weaker sections or someone earning ?8 lakh? A person earning ?8 lakh per annum is an income-tax assessee. You cannot withdraw an appointment order even if the individual who got it under economic criteria improves his status. They (BJP) want to support a community.
The move will lead to corruption as people may bribe to get certificates. Instead, the Centre can extend scholarships and welfare schemes.
The PM announced that ?15 lakh would be deposited in the accounts of every poor person. If you do that then there will be no economically weaker section in the country. What is the necessity to bring this bill?
That is why I opposed and walked out.
The Centre has sanctioned studies for a new Mullaperiyar dam and Mekedatu plan. There are apprehensions about the Dam Safety Bill too going against TN’s interests.
This is how national parties treat Tamil Nadu. They should not be called all-India parties, but regional parties. The BJP never ruled Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha or West Bengal. Now, the Congress which once ruled all states has become a regional party. That is why we are opposing, just as they do, vote bank politics. They cannot secure a vote from Tamil Nadu and hence they are victimizing us.
Do you mean to say that the BJP government is not supportive of the AIADMK government?
They support us on some issues, but not major issues. Cauvery is an example. They have their own interest in Karnataka. Despite representations from TN, the Centre has not released ?10,000 crore dues on various heads.
But the Palaniswami government insists it has cordial relations with the Centre. O Panneerselvam sent New Year greetings to BJP president Amit Shah.
A government cannot antagonize another government. We are cooperative with the Centre and the latter is also friendly to us. We struck an alliance in 2004 and lost all seats. Amma took a different stand of not aligning with national parties since then. As an MP, I send birthday greetings to Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. You cannot attribute any motive to this.
You are the most strident critic of Modi government? Is it a deliberate strategy?
No. Modi is a good friend of mine since 2002. I used to accompany Amma whenever she visited Gujarat. Similarly, I took Modi to her residence whenever he visited Chennai. Friendship is different, politics is different.
AIADMK MP Anwhar Rajhaa said the Triple Talaq Bill is barbaric. Is he in sync with your party?
That is our party’s stand because government must not interfere with religious conventions and customs. Let Muslims decide on the grievances of their women. The AIADMK always stands for social justice and women empowerment.
It’s just four months for LS polls. Is your party under pressure to align with the BJP?
That I don’t know. Coordinator (OPS) and joint coordinator (EPS) will take the decision.
You lost Senthil Balaji to the DMK. Aren’t you making any move to win over the rebels?
Ours is a mass-based party, where individuals don’t matter. But, there is still a charisma of MGR and Amma among people. And cadres stand by us.
Is there a possibility of taking back TTV Dhinakaran and the AMMK?
No comments. I am only a propaganda secretary, the party leadership will decide on such issues.

Its bizarre rationale for the patriarchal religious practices only highlights the fact that the Muslim clergy has failed to reform and keep pace with the times. Instead, AIMPLB uses the right to freedom of religion to preserve their dominant position over the Muslim community.
AIMPLB’s argument that Muslims have the unbridled right to practise their religion whichever way they interpret it is specious. In fact, no religious denomination has that right in democratic India, including the majority Hindu community. Democracy doesn’t mean the unfettered will of the people. It means freedoms within the bounds of a Constitution. And the Constitution of India guarantees the right to equality for all. What AIMPLB is trying to say is that it is free to cherry-pick constitutional guarantees. While it sees the right to freedom of religion as sacrosanct, it doesn’t feel obligated to observe the right to equality vis-a-vis Muslim women.
Let me be clear, respecting constitutional principles isn’t just for the Muslim community. It is for all Indians. Hence, self-proclaimed gau-rakshaks are going against the Constitution of India in resorting to vigilantism against Muslims and Dalits over the beef issue. But what AIMPLB is contending in defending triple talaq and polygamy, which at the moment are legal for Muslims in India, is that the Indian state has no business interfering in Muslim affairs.
That is a patently wrong assumption. When Muslim women express their grievances and petition the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional, the Indian state cannot look the other way. The truth is, things would not have come to this pass had the Muslim clergy reformed and modernised personal laws. In case of Hindus, personal laws have evolved over the decades to supersede traditional religious practices and thereby empower women—for example in terms of securing inheritance and property rights. The Muslim community needs its own set of reforms.
And if the Muslim clergy and AIMPLB continue to resist reforms, not only will aggrieved parties seek judicial and state intervention, but the former would also be guilty of perpetuating the wrong perception that the Muslim community is allergic to modern democratic values. Ideally AIMPLB should shun triple talaq and polygamy and provide a progressive outlook for Muslim women. If this doesn’t happen, the Supreme Court should strike down the two religious practices as unconstitutional.

     nowadays people are discussing this topics quiet frequently, this is completely due to lack of islamic knowledge and teaching towards each and every individual, here is my proposal to read and consider this may be a solution,  make an islamic education board, will prescribe syllabus with the help and consultations with all the famous islamic scholars, and made compulsory in each and every school, will teach all levels or classes throughout his/her academic career, will teach islamic studies with the help of quran and hadiths in order to make muslims boys and girls, must be aware of islamic teaching right from the childhood with do&#039;s and don&#039;ts in islam and how to live their lives throughout his/ her career, will definitely help them in overcoming all the problems and misconception about islam and muslim. this is the need of the hour and will definitely benefits all including students, parents, teachers, societies and the environment to overcome our day to day problems and will give solution in many ways.note : aimplb should consider my suggestion in the serious manner, must convey and discuss with the scholars with co-ordination with the government at all level to build a healthy, happy, peaceful environment in our society....

"1616952915-25","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/14/?s=triple+talaq","Uniform civil code","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/satyam-bruyat/uniform-civil-code/","Uniform civil code","June 2, 2014, 10:36 AM  IST","Markandey Katju","The issue of a uniform civil code has recently been raised. I am fully in support of a uniform civil code.
Article 44 of the Indian Constitution states : ” The state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India “.
No doubt Article 44 is in the Directive Principles, and not the Fundamental Rights of our Constitution, but Article 37 states :

” The provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable in any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws .”
The Constitution was made in 1950, and 64 years have passed since it was promulgated, but Article 44 has till now been totally ignored, obviously for vote bank politics.
I have been raising my voice consistently whenever there was any atrocity on, or oppression of, Muslims, but on the issue of a uniform civil code I have firm views. In fact one of the reasons for Muslims in India remaining backward is that there was no modernization of their personal law.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-13119"" alt=""muslim-girls"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/muslim-girls.jpg"" width=""474"" height=""314"">
In all modern countries there is usually one common law for everybody. In fact in India there is one common criminal law (IPC and Cr PC) for everybody, and the land laws (e.g. the UP Zamindari Abolition Act, 1951) for everyone. Nobody objected to that, though many of these laws are against the Muslim law. For instance, Muslim law provides for stoning to death for women committing adultery, but that would be illegal under the IPC.
The injustice in Muslim Law can be seen in the fact that a Muslim husband can divorce his wife by simply saying ‘talaq, talaq, tqlaq’, without ascribing any reason, whereas a Muslim wife cannot do so. She has to file a petition in court, which usually takes years to decide, and she must make out a ground (e.g. cruelty, adultery, etc).
Thus there is discrimination against the wife in two ways :
1. A Muslim husband can get a divorce immediately without going to court by immediately pronouncing a triple talaq or even sending a letter mentioning the triple talaq, whereas the wife who seeks divorce has to go to court and file a petition which usually takes years to decide.
2. The Muslim husband need not give any ground for divorce, he can divorce his wife whimsically or merely because he has lost interest in her, whereas a Muslim wife has to plead some ground for divorce mentioned in section 2 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, and she has to produce witnesses or documentary evidence in support of that ground, and prove it. This is not only very unjust to the wife, it is also violation of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.
Article 15(3) of the Constitution states that there can be no law against women, but there can be a law in their favour. The Muslim law of divorce is directly contrary to Article 15(3).
I know of a case where a Muslim girl was married to a Muslim young man who had come from England to marry her. It was an arranged marriage. After the wedding in India the young man went back to England alone, saying that he will arrange for his wife to come to England, but instead of doing so he sent a letter of talaq within a month. The girl almost committed suicide.
When the Supreme Court gave a progressive judgment in Shahbano’s case many Muslims raised a hue and cry against it, saying it was against the shariat That judgment said that a Muslim husband has to give maintenance to his wife if he divorces her. This was a humanitarian judgment, because who will support a divorced woman (who may have children) except her husband? All over the world a husband has to give maintenance to his wife if he divorces her. Why then should it be different for Muslims? Muslims should have supported this judgment, but instead most of them raised big a hue and cry saying it is against the shariat and Rajiv Gandhi, afraid to lose his Muslim vote bank, legislatively repealed the ruling.
I may give another illustration of the backwardness of some of the Muslim laws. When I was a Judge in the Supreme Court a case came before my bench from Orissa. In some village in Orissa there was a young Muslim couple with 3 children. One night under the influence of liquor the husband had a quarrel with his wife and said to her ‘talaq,talaq, talaq’. Nobody else was present at that time, and nobody came to know of it. However, about a month thereafter the wife was indiscrete, and told a friend of hers about this, and this friend told someone else, and so on, until the Maulana of the local mosque came to know of it. He then declared that the couple were no longer husband and wife, and so could not be allowed to live together. At this a mob of local Muslims reached the couple’s house and told the wife to get out of her husband’s house as she was no longer his wife. She protested that she had 3 small children, but the mob would not relent. A petition was filed before the Orissa High Court, which was dismissed, and against that order an appeal came before my bench in the Supreme Court.

I observed in court that everyone in this country has to behave in a civilized manner, whether Hindu or Muslim. If the couple wants to live together, how is it anyone’s business? I then directed the police to give protection to the couple.
The Muslim law is that if a husband divorces his wife he cannot straightaway thereafter remarry her. After the divorce the woman must marry some other man, and the marriage must be consummated, and only if thereafter the second husband divorces her can the first husband remarry her. Is this rational?
A Muslim man can marry 4 wives, but a woman can, at a time, have only one husband. Now monogamy represents equality between man and woman, and this is the age of equality. So why should polygamy be permitted to Muslim males? It may be mentioned that upto 1955 a Hindu male could have unlimited number of wives, whereas a woman could have only one husband. This law was altered by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which provides for monogamy.
It can be seen that much of the Muslim personal law is totally outdated and inhuman, but it is not allowed to be changed due to vote bank politics.
I submit that those who have not allowed changes in the Muslim personal law have done a great disservice to Muslims. Retaining the outdated personal law has contributed to keeping Muslims backward.
Law has to change with changes in society. To insist that laws made 1500 years ago must continue in the 21st century is totally stupid and unrealistic.
Before ending I wish to say that I know that some Muslims may oppose my views, but that is wholly irrelevant fore me. I have always supported Muslims whenever I thought that injustice was being done to them, and my track record can be seen in this connection. In my opinion great injustice has been done to Muslims by not modernizing their personal law.

"1616953723-217","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=triple+talaq","Scrap triple talaq, polygamy","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/cursor/scrap-triple-talaq-polygamy/","Scrap triple talaq, polygamy","April 6, 2016, 6:39 AM  IST","T K Arun","When the government files its response to the Supreme Court on a plea by Shayara Bano, a Muslim woman from Uttarakhand, to invalidate the practice of Muslim men performing divorce by the simple expedient of pronouncing talaq three times, it should accept the plea.
There will be howls of protest, but such defence of Muslim women’s democratic rights is essential for the defence of India’s minorities from majoritarian attack.
This might seem contradictory. How does removal of triple talaq, seen by most Muslims (or, at least, Muslim men) as an integral part of their right to practise their faith, protect Muslims, instead of further shrinking their space?
Democracy Underpins… Protection of minority rights, in India, is embedded in democracy. It is easy to overlook the significance of this. The protection of minority rights in Independent India is very different from, say, the right the King of Cochin gave Jews, Christians and Muslims to live in his kingdom and practise their faith as they chose.
In polytheistic Hindu culture, theological deviance does not exist. Any kind of pursuit of spirituality is deemed valid, given the extreme variety within Hinduism itself. This made it easy, even natural, for Hindu kings to treat their non-Hindu subjects as a self-contained community or communities with its/their own practices and customs that others need not interfere with.
This live and let live philosophy is not what underpins the rights of minorities in democratic India. We, the people of India, have given unto ourselves a Constitution, which guarantees several fundamental rights, including the rights of minorities to freely practise and propagate their religion, own property and establish places of worship and run educational institutions. These are important rights, key to keeping India a functional democracy.
What about religious and social customs that conflict with democratic rights to equality and justice? Without any qualification, the entire might of the state must weigh in on the side of equality and justice against unjust custom and religious practice. Caste discrimination and the practices of Sati, dowry and son preference were integral to Hinduism for centuries, but have no place in a democracy.
Triple talaq and polygamy are on a similar footing. They have to go, to strengthen democracy, which, in turn, will strengthen the democratic rights of religious minorities. This argument is different from two other distinct arguments that are often put forward to demand the scrapping of triple talaq and polygamy.
The first one is based on a reading of the Quran, to say that the triple talaq has no place in the Muslim holy book and that the Quranic conditions for polygamy are so stringent as to make it impossible in modern circumstances. The second argument is to demand social reform for Muslims, on the ground that interpretations of religious dicta have to change with the times.
While all three arguments seek the common goal of scrapping triple talaq and polygamy, their premises are different and their discourses are different. The latter two can as well take place in a theological state, one with little time for democracy. Whether arguments within the framework of religious propriety reach a productive conclusion or not, the democratic argument for ending the discrimination against Muslim women in terms of the protection the state grants women within marriage and separation has to end in remedial action rather than procrastination.
Waffle is not an option. …All Subaltern Rights Several Muslim leaders see in the attack on triple talaq and polygamy an attack on the sharia and the right of Muslims to practise their faith. This is absurd. Muslims in India suffer no spiritual injury because the sharia has no place in India’s criminal jurisprudence.
Why should that part of the sharia, of questionable validity even within Islamic jurisprudence, which tramples on the rights of women become the touchstone of minority rights in this country?
In India, most political parties, save the BJP, have chosen to steer clear of the conflict between the democratic rights of Muslim women and provisions of Muslim personal law, for fear of antagonising Muslim voters. Such vacillation now hurts minority rights.
The BJP has been a strident critic of triple talaq and polygamy because these come in handy to bash Muslims, reducing whom to second-class citizens is the goal of the Sangh Parivar, of which the BJP is a part. The furore over beef and conflation of national pride with the iconography of the nation as the mother goddess are ways of getting at the Muslims.
In such a scenario, defence of India’s democratic framework is the way to defend the minorities. Defence of democracy entails defence of the democratic rights of Muslim women. Bits of Muslim custom and law that violate democracy will have to go, to protect core minority rights. To prevaricate on this is not just opportunism but to let down the minorities.

To win the biggest prize of them all, the BJP created a precise mix, a fabulous mesmerising combination that persuaded voters in UP to press the button on the ‘lotus’. It combined development with deprivation and repackaged the negative as a masterstroke against the corrupt and their hidden-away riches through demonetisation. It sed sub-caste to break up the dominant caste monopolies. The plan could have bombed. But how it has blossomed instead.
The Narendra Modi wave is a minutely crafted strategy of the kind that promises to deliver opportunity to move up those who have been left behind, in economic and caste terms, by the successive regimes of Yadavs in 2012 and Jatavs in 2007, with the inevitable cornering of benefits and cash.
Modi needed to consistently present outstanding performances at the rallies organised by Amit Shah. And he did so. The whiff of the ‘salt of the earth’ emanating from his speeches and presence made him authentic and believable to voters who badly needed a change — especially after the shenanigans of the Yadav clan.
There were some big ‘first time ever’ moves leading up to the polls: forwarding the Budget presentation by a month; repackaging demonetisation as remonetisation; the easing of restrictions on cash withdrawals by RBI; pushing direct transfer of benefits; and other propoor moves.
The Election Commission may have raised eyebrows at these ‘tangential’ tactics of skirting the prohibitions of the Model Code of Conduct on policy announcements by a political party that directly benefit voters going to the poll, but it also didn’t raise more than just those eyebrows.
Laptops, crop loans, waiving interest, free cooking gas connections, free internet, free cows, more crop insurance…all these gave the BJP an advantage that was unmatched by any regional party. And these were backed by the Union Budget provisions, giving substance to the hope of politics with performance.
As the party in power at the Centre, the BJP used it to shoulder out the rivals with nothing to offer on a similar scale. It carried conviction with the sections of voters who have felt left behind by the caste politics of the SP and the BSP.

The polarisation of votes was used to drive home the message: if you are with us, you are better off.
This message was delivered as much to the Hindu voter as to Muslim families, where triple talaq has caused consternation. It stirred emotions and it reminded the left-behind of their woes. The BJP’s appeal was a mix of memory and desire.
The BJP’s UP poll campaign has set new standards of competition. Despite all the talk of development and good governance and the shuffling towards a post-Mandal world, it is also a throwback to the good ole days when political parties blatantly offered sops to voters to win them over.
Modi’s reincarnation as the messiah of the poor, the left-behind and the discriminated after the UP elections is now complete. The anti-BJP opposition is now faced with an uphill task.
The Congress is no match and the regional parties are too small to resist if the BJP follows through on pushing to change the law and forcing simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies, where it can use its newly invented strategy to overwhelm the voter with great expectations of a change for the better.
On the other hand, Modi and his team may have a problem of their own creation by winning UP, which is big, complex and difficult to hold.

Farook was allegedly murdered for circulating an atheist post on his social media group that had angered the assailants. The news has only elicited mild protest from activists and no vigorous condemnation from political parties.
This leads one to believe that the muted response is a direct result of the political calculation that condemnation of the murder would offend the Muslim community in general, and the Muslim clergy in particular. This is the same calculation that has driven the politics of secular parties such as Congress for decades. From Shah Bano to politically empowering Muslim clerics, time after time Congress has been guilty of appeasing the Muslim clergy in the name of secularism. This has been a selfish strategy propagated with the sole aim of vote bank politics. It hasn’t benefited ordinary Muslims. Nor has it empowered liberal Muslim intellectuals with community connect. It has simply enhanced the powers of conservative mullahs who have prevented the social advancement of the Muslim community.
Why this deference for the Muslim clergy? True, religion plays an important part in Muslim life. But that doesn’t mean that the Muslim clergy should have an all-pervasive role within the ummah. The problem is that the relationship between the Muslim clergy and the Muslim community has been determined by political power. Ideally, Muslims themselves should decide what role the clergy should play in their lives.
That empowering the Muslim clergy has suppressed genuine Muslim voices can be gauged by the ongoing debate on triple talaq and polygamy. A large section of Muslim women has been demanding that these outmoded patriarchal practices be proscribed to ensure their constitutional right to equality. Not surprisingly, the Muslim clergy and orthodox community leaders are opposing any such change citing freedom of religion and non-interference in Muslim religious practice. But why should secular parties go along with this? Does the constitutional principal of equality matter less than secularism? Can secularism be built on the edifice of discrimination against a particular group of people?
The political games that secular parties have played with the Muslim community have not only ensured social conservatism in the latter but have also created fertile grounds for extremism. This explains why some Muslim men thought it was their religious duty to murder a professed atheist. At the same time, by empowering conservative mullahs and allowing them to speak for the Muslim community, secular parties like Congress helped set in Hindu counter-polarisation. There’s no denying the fact that the rise of the Hindu right-wing in Indian politics and its political dominance today are a direct result of distortion of secularism by so-called secular parties. The right-wing has managed to successfully portray these parties as pseudo-secular and favouring only one community. This also explains the elevation of Yogi Adityanath as UP chief minister.
If secular parties like Congress are to have a future they must stop appeasement policies and speak for the people across communities. They must stop pandering to religious leaders – be they from any community – for the sake of vote bank politics. Real secularism is neutral to all religions and focusses on combating discrimination among communities. It speaks for the weak for the sake of justice, not politics. Congress and other secular parties must reappraise their approach towards secularism to evolve and survive. That’s the only way they can counter right-wing forces.

     moslem are unfortunately made slaves by the mullahs and politicians, forced to live under the laws that were prevalent 1000 years ago. today the world has moved ahead, social and other structures have evolved and are governed by entirely new set of rules. the islamic scholars need to understand this and change as per the demand of time. time and tide wait for none, if they do not accept this, they will be left behind in dark ages and rest of the world will progress towards prosperity....

Despite Narendra Modi’s avowals to the contrary last week, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s zeal to abolish this controversial practice has more to do with its commitment to a uniform civil code and a Hindu Rashtra rather than compassion for a Muslim woman. The record of the Congress in this regard is no better. A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court will soon begin hearing a host of petitions challenging its constitutional validity and it’s difficult to predict the outcome.
The solution, however, lies neither in a social boycott proposed by the Muslim Personal Law Board, nor a mere change in the law. The real answer is a radical transformation of the mindset. To this end, it is important to understand how women have changed in history, from being mostly objects of male pleasure to free and equal human beings. It’s a useful lesson for not only Muslims but also Hindus, whose personal law may be more liberal, but its practice leaves much to be desired.
While men and women are biologically unequal, society has historically institutionalised this into an inequality of power. Anthropological evidence suggests that prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies were more egalitarian; patriarchy or male dominance developed only after the invention of agriculture. Aristotle thought men were naturally superior and women’s role was only to reproduce and serve men in the household. The early Christian Church formalised this inequality. Manu did the same in India. He believed women were morally weak and hence, dharma texts fashioned a social code of streedharma that conditioned women to accept a subordinate place in the patriarchal Brahminical society. Feminists argue that the stories of Sita, Savitri and others were created so that the woman would ‘voluntarily’ aspire to a subordinate role.
Oddly enough, it was the discovery of romantic love in the 12th century which brought a degree of freedom and equality to women, breaking entrenched social barriers. Romantic love is personal, subjective, and idealises the beloved as a superior being; thus, it turns a woman into a subject rather than an object. It is a mistake to think that romantic love originated in the West. It seems to have blossomed in three different parts of the world around the same time, expressed in three extraordinary literary works. In Europe, it culminated in Bedier’s Tristan and Isolde; in Islamic Persia, it flowered in the romance of Nizami’s Laila and Majnun. In India, it found expression in the divine love of Radha and Krishna in Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda. Prior to romantic love, there existed mostly erotic love, where a woman was an object, not the subject of love.
Unlike India and Persia, the romantic movement evolved in the West, culminating in 18th century Enlightenment. One of its inspirations was the philosopher Immanuel Kant’s moral law — treat a human being not as a means but as an end — and this gave dignity to women. Modern marriage was born at the same time, based on love, replacing the old economic arrangement to raise a family. Women also challenged male domination by fighting for the right to vote in the 19th century and the Women’s Movement in the 20th century has gone on to effect profound changes in Western society, especially in marriage, including the “no fault” divorce, the right of women to abortion and property, as well as more equitable wages in the workplace.
All these ideas and practices have now spread around the world as a part of global modernity. Even though India retains its attachment to

‘arranged marriage’, it has gradually adopted features of the modern ‘love marriage’. Under the influence of Bollywood, urban middle class men are becoming less dominant and women less submissive. This trend will continue but we must avoid the breakdown of marriage and family of the West. Yes, the outrageous ‘triple talaq’ must go, but we must go beyond it. The minds and hearts of all Indians have to change in order to give dignity, equality, and self-respect to women. Changing the law is only the beginning, as Mahatma Gandhi used to say. Indians need to internalise the ideals of modernity, not as Western imitations, but in the way Gandhi thought of liberty and equality as emanating from sadharana dharma.

There seems to be a consensus on this. Among children, however, the jury is still out on Santa Claus. For the more historically minded, Santa Claus a.k.a. Father Christmas is a legendary character based on the 4th-century Greek bishop Saint Nicholas. So, Santa C’s authenticity — the quality of being true — is somewhat in doubt.
Luckily, children are unlikely to take offence beyond a sulk and a bawl. With one childhood concoction out of the way, children can take one more step towards becoming a bona fide ‘grown-up’. For which all of us are thankful, since the alternative would have been to loudly accept that Santa is as real as Rani Padmavati.
This would have, in turn, led to some bright sparks pounce and keep insisting that Mr Claus is a figment of the human imagination — aided by the depiction of the red-and-white suit-clad white-bearded Ho-Ho-Homo sapien.
The cult of authenticity is, of course, not confined to Christmas’ most famous personality. (The modern and universal Christmas bonhomie is marked by a far larger number of people donning Santa caps and masks than those wearing crucifixes or visiting churches.) Every time there’s a ruckus over the eating of beef in India, for instance, the fact that ancient Indians — not just ‘Hindus’ but also Buddhists and Jains — merrily consumed the cow is trotted out.
An ‘authentic’ reading of the Koran is regularly cited to underline the fact that Islam is ‘a religion of peace’ and those using it as a tool to justify hatred are ‘misreading’ it terribly.
Then there are those for whom the latest depiction of Sherlock Holmes in the TV series, Sherlock, is ‘inauthentic’ and thereby unappealing as it’s not set in Victorian London but in Will & Kate’s contemporary Britain. This fetish for the ‘authentic’ is as misplaced as a mistletoe in a Nagpur boy scouts’ camp. What matters is where things ‘end up in’, not ‘where they originally were’.
So, to make an argument that beef-eating is fine because Indians ate sirloin curry centuries ago; that there is only one ‘benevolent’ reading of the Koran; that Holmes has to be British Raj-era because Arthur Conan Doyle meant it so; or that 21st-century India needs to be less squeamish about sex in general and safe sex in particular simply because India is the ‘land of Khajuraho and the Kama Sutra’, is to fall prey to the dogma of the authentic.
The practice of instant triple talaq was deemed illegal not because it has no mention in the Koran or any of the hadiths but because it is unconstitutional.
Similarly, beef-eating finds its defence not in historian D N Jha’s wonderfully revealing The Myth of the Holy Cow, but in the right to dietary freedom in democratic India. The same holds true for sexual freedom without having to invoke depictions of contorted sexual positions and other erotica.

In November, the auction house Christie’s sold a painting for a record $450 million. The painting was discovered in 2011and identified as a Leonardo da Vinci original. Some art critics were aghast not just at the price fetched by ‘Salvator Mundi’ (Saviour of the World), but also cast serious doubts on the painting’s ‘authenticity’. Certain qualities (its flatness, its lack of any background), they insisted, made the painting highly unlikely to be a da Vinci.
While they attacked at the complete craziness and moneygrubbery of the contemporary art world where the overwhelming value of a painting came from its price, they ironically also fell for the trap of looking beyond the work of art itself. So what if the depiction of Christ, in Zen-like repose, wasn’t by Leonardo da Vinci? To know whether something is authentic or not has its own value.
But to take that out of the drawer to make acase for or against something is to believe that things are incapable of, and should not, change.
Which is why this Christmas, I heartily recommend ‘Jingle Bell-wa Jingle Bell-wa… (https://youtu.be/IW-3O0qizJ4), the Bhojpuri version of thatChristmas song made by the creators of the (fictional?) yellow creatures, Minions. Wishing you a genuine-fake Merry Christmas!

This may include provisions like her right to pronounce triple talaq or oral instant divorce. Needless to say AIMPLB is being inconsistent in making this argument. It stated in an affidavit submitted to the apex court last year that Sharia grants right of divorce to husbands because men have greater power of decision-making. Given such patriarchal thinking, AIMPLB’s take on Muslim women too having the right to exercise triple talaq appears far removed from reality.
There’s no denying the fact that triple talaq is a discriminatory practice that treats Muslim women as second-class citizens. Plus, to argue that triple talaq is intrinsic to Islam is specious. Triple talaq is banned in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. That most petitioners against triple talaq have been Muslim women shows that AIMPLB can’t even claim that the entire Indian Muslim community supports this practice.
There is, however, merit in the argument that religious beliefs are given considerable currency in matters of state and society in India. As has been argued by AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal, Hindu customs and practices are often protected by the law. At a time when such protections are being expanded through provisions such as food bans in BJP-ruled states, completely ignoring religious sentiments in the Muslim community will legitimately attract the charge of discrimination.
In that context, the Centre’s proclamation that it will come up with a new law if the apex court strikes down triple talaq as unconstitutional doesn’t add up. This position doesn’t elaborate what the alternative to triple talaq is. Government, in consultation with the Muslim community, needs to propose such an alternative that is compatible with Muslim jurisprudence. An ideal approach would be to look at best practices among Muslim communities – the Ahle Hadees and Jafri sects consider talaq uttered thrice in one sitting as one talaq and allow for mediation and reconciliation between the couple – and mandate those religious practices that are in conformity with the constitutional principle of women’s equality.

In the annals of India’s parliamentary history July 30, 2019, represents one such day. The passage of the historic triple talaq bill in Parliament’s Upper House is not just about enactment of one more law. It is about correcting a historical wrong. It is about restoring honour and dignity to Muslim women. It is about establishing gender equality.
The bill’s passage shows the Modi government’s commitment to walk the talk on social reforms with a steadfast focus, despite resistance from opposition. It provides statutory shield to Muslim women who have been silently bearing the brunt of an utterly sinful practice.
A careful reading of the events during the bill’s passage in the Rajya Sabha, as well as those outside Parliament, reveal some important pointers. For one, it brought out the Modi government’s relentless efforts to accord social dignity, respect and honour to women in India. Equally importantly, it also completely exposed the duplicitous intent of the Congress party, which has all along treated minorities as a vote bank, perpetuating a deep-rooted inequality that cared little about women’s self-respect.
Another interesting facet that has emerged is Congress’s diminishing ability to rally other parties around its partisan obduracy. When a government remains dedicated to the cause of public and social welfare, which is the case with the Narendra Modi government, it is only natural for other parties to support it.

The support the triple talaq bill has received from non-NDA parties is welcome. We also appeal to all parties to rise above political differences and offer non-partisan support to such issues that are critical for India to progress as a nation and society.
It is important to analyse Congress’s role on triple talaq through the prism of India’s recent political history. Congress, which had more than 400 MPs in the Lok Sabha three decades ago, had a great opportunity to change the historical wrong to Muslim women in the Shah Bano case. In 1985, the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of triple talaq victim Shah Bano, made her entitled to an allowance of Rs 500 per month, and had said that the order was in conformity with the Sharia law. However, instead of implementing it, Congress led by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi succumbed to pressure from clerics represented by Muslim personal board and the lure of vote bank politics and enacted a law to nullify the court’s order.
The capitulation appalled even the left-leaning legal luminary, former SC judge Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Arif Mohammed Khan, a minister in the then Congress government who had termed the court decision as fair, resigned in protest against the government’s decision. Rajiv Gandhi had made Khan believe that he would implement the progressive SC verdict.
The issue had since remained in cold storage for years, and when the Modi government brought it up, there was no change in the Congress’s malicious ambivalence. Congress’s double standards and divisive politics that existed 30 years ago were on vivid display as it tried subterfuges to thwart the attempt to right the wrong committed by Rajiv Gandhi. The obstructionism only reflected core character that perpetuates appeasement and vote bank politics. The law banning triple talaq marks a huge blow to such politics.
This bill has also thoroughly exposed the so-called liberals in India. Many of these “liberals” who proclaim themselves to be champions of gender justice were conspicuously silent or employed ruses to oppose a bill that sought to empower Muslim women. The duplicity has exposed that these self-styled liberals are driven by narrow partisan politics instead of humanitarian values.
Importantly, those who question the need to have such a law forget that hundreds of cases of the atrocity that triple talaq was, had been reported after January 2017 when SC outlawed the practice. The brazenness necessitated a strict law to clamp down on the unjust practice. That the law is not against Islam is borne out by the fact that 19 countries including Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Syria have banned instant oral divorce.
We need to understand that women who fought a long battle against triple talaq didn’t have any political motive. They were normal women who showed extreme courage to fight against injustices they were subjected to. They were determined to put an end to this practice and finally won the battle in the country’s highest court. By legislating a triple talaq law our government has given a statutory backing to their battle. After all, lawmakers and political parties are duty bound to give voice and right direction to such fights.
Opposition’s argument questioning the need for law applicable only to Muslim society is also baseless. Independent India has seen enactment of laws aimed at reforming entrenched practices in other communities. Hindu Marriage Act, Christian Marriage Act, and laws to ban child marriage and dowry are examples of such interventions.
Those engaging in opportunistic, narrow political arguments refuse to acknowledge these. Those who question making triple talaq a criminal offence conveniently ignore that several other practices related to Hindu society are considered criminal offence and attract severe punishment.
The Narendra Modi government deserves credit for enacting a law to ban triple talaq. I am sure Modiji will now go down in history as a social reformer in the league of Raja Rammohan Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who waged struggles to improve the lot of women.

     One of the questions that everybody is asking is that why should triple talaq be criminalized when the supreme court had already made triple talaq ivalid. Why the punishment. Isn't just banning triple talaq enough? The answer is a big NO. Many people seems to not understand Islam well. That's why this question is being repeated everywhere. I'll try to explain why it is extremely important to punish triple talaq offenders. Let's beginAccording to Islam, once a man pronounce the final talaq, they're no longer husband and wife. Their marriage is over. They're separate people, not husband and wife. So as far a Muslim man who pronounce the third talaq, for him, she's no longer his wife. Whatever the court and law says, it doesn't matter to him. Because his religion says otherwise. If the law says triple talaq is invalid, for him, his religion already made him believe that they're no longer husband & wife. According to Islam, once the last talaq is pronounced, they're separate people and there's no going back from this. The man can't take back the woman as wife anymore. It's not allowed in Islam. If they live together again, Islam considers it adultery, which is a punishable offense in Islam, and against God's will.An Islamic believer who fear god, hell, punishment after death, somebody who wish to go to heaven, will never want to commit this religious crime. So what'll happen when the court says look, she's still your wife because you've said triple talaq which is not valid? To protect his religious belief, the man have no other choice but to get divorce anyway. So he'll go for legal divorce. Which simply means, a divorce which is initiated by triple talaq will continue legally. This means, simply banning triple talaw isn't enough and it can never stop triple talaq divorces. If we just ban and not punish triple talaq, it'll become a useless law. Law will be there and triple talaq divorces will continue legally. This is why even after supreme court ban triple talaq, the triple talaq cases continuing.Only way to stop this menace is to stop Muslim men from saying triple talaq which even they can't take back once they say it. How to do it? By punishment only. There's no other way....  Read More

Former Supreme Court judge and Chairperson of the 21st Law Commission Justice BS Chauhan spoke to Aarti Tikoo Singh about UCC and Law Commission’s thinking on it:
What is the historical significance of UCC?
When the Constituent Assembly discussed it for the first time, many people were not agreeable to a UCC so BR Ambedkar left it for the future. That is why, in the Constitution, a specific word was used in Article 44 (UCC): “endeavour”. The Code is an aspirational idea. Most of the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution like education, healthcare, nutrition and environment have been enforced by way of various Acts. But there is no conversation about UCC.
The Supreme Court has also been asking in several judgments why UCC has not come into existence as yet. The last judgment came in 2015 and it is in that context we got the reference to initiate a debate on it.
What does UCC mean and why does India need it?
We ourselves don’t know what UCC is and what is required. At this stage, we cannot anticipate what should be its template or model, what will be acceptable to people and to what extent the government is willing to go ahead with it. We have merely started an academic debate because we want to know what people think and what they want.
Why did you choose to go to people directly?
The Commission is only a recommending body and we believe in democratic procedure. We did not want to recommend something that people do not want. After collecting feedback, we will be able to draw an inference whether the time for UCC has come or not. Our recommendations will go to a standing committee, then to Parliament and ultimately it is the government’s decision whether it wants to implement it or not.
How will the Commission process massive feedback from across the country?
We have assigned staff to deal with feedback from day one. We have received thousands of letters and emails. This is not for the first time that we are conducting such an exercise. The Law Commission recently asked for opinions from all the lawyers across the country on reforms required in the Advocates Act, 1961.
But several religious minority groups have protested against the initiative on UCC.
Our recommendations will not be made on numbers alone. There will be deliberations with political and religious leaders also. I have already assured minority groups that nothing will happen without consulting them. We are not in a hurry. So i would say it is too early for anyone to protest.
Critics think the Law Commission questionnaire is loaded against only one community. Do you agree?
If there are bad customs and practices in our society, irrespective of religious community, and if people point them out, we will certainly consider them.
Are there any other customs and practices like ‘Maitree Karaar’ (mistress deed) among Hindus which need reform and inclusion in your questionnaire?
There are many customs across India which need to be reviewed and reformed. For example, polyandry among Hindus is probably still being practised at some places. But how does the new India look at such practices? That is something we would like to know from the people of the country.
Will UCC impinge on the fundamental right to religion?
That is the question the abrogation of triple talaq raises but it is pending in the Supreme Court. Whatever the court’s decision, we will be guided and bound by it.
Do courts have the authority or power to interfere in citizens’ religious practices?
Courts and governments do not have a right to interfere in citizens’ religious faith. But there is a difference between religion or faith and religious practice. Practices such as untouchability, devdasi, child marriage, polygamy were bad practices in the name of religion and therefore banned by law. For 2,000 years, same-gotra marriage was prohibited but Hindu Marriage Act 1955, permitted it.
Child marriage is still rampant. So what is the purpose of reformative laws like UCC if there is hardly any enforcement?
Even if there is low enforcement of laws, the aggrieved party should always have the recourse to knock at the doors of judiciary. In the absence of law, victims have nothing to fall back on.

Exactly a week ago, London, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Delhi, Islamabad respectfully made way for Barcelona. ‘Mowing down tourists is the new normal’ despaired the Evening Standard while Londoners sat transfixed to the too- familiar photograph of a bloodied avenue. Las Ramblas, the very metaphor of hedonism, had been bustling with carefree crowds when a van emerged like a bat out of hell – driven with a fervour linked to the promise of heaven. The next Monday, a bomb alert evacuated the same stretch.
East and West have met in terror. True, each had had enough of its own, but now it’s of a common genre. What demons – or angels – drive 22-year-olds to get behind a wheel and ram coldly into unsuspecting strangers? And how alert can we be when jihad comes via such everyday objects as a van, kitchen knife – or the tiffin box bombs of Mumbai and Delhi.
This column swells from my time on the Ramblas, my awe over something as civilised as a 1.2 km thoroughfare dedicated to pedestrians, leaving vehicles to fend for themselves on its margins. My first encounter with this incredible boulevard came at an international AIDS conference in 2002. It was where India’s HIV-afflicted finally found their voice, and through which a flamboyant Shatrughan Sinha swaggered as health minister. So the many stories to be filed kept me away from Las Ramblas’s tireless blandishments. But my hotel was right on it, and i went to bed with riffs of laughter and the weeping of violins. In the morning when i walked to catch my tube, it lay exhausted from its multiple orgasms.
Two other visits allowed a more touristy appreciation. Of the Ramblas’s gilded ‘statue’ men, the segueing of the world’s accents, the flowers, food and baubles, the eccentric Gaudi architecture just off it, and suave Hispanics seducing over La Riojas or returning from a late-late concert, the men in long formal skirts (you read that right).
Now in London, my two always-must-dos are also stained by recent attacks: the Borough market and Westminster bridge. But the crowds still mill undaunted. It’s the most effective thumbed-nose to terror. Or so they say.

She just got married to Nikhil Jain, who, by his name, is apparently Hindu. She sported vermilion, a mangalsutra, bangles, and a bindi in Parliament. A group of Indian Muslim clerics have issued a fatwa against Jahan for her “un-Islamic” appearance.
Jahan says that she remains a Muslim even after marriage. What happens though to most Hindu women in India who marry Muslim men? Are they forced to convert to Islam? Even if they remain Hindu, aren’t they forced to bring up their children as Muslim? The children are in general given Arabic or Persian names.
This hypocrisy is what has driven the moderate Hindu to Narendra Modi. This hypocrisy is what has defeated you, Rahul Gandhi. Why did you stand from the Muslim-dominated “safe” seat of Wayanad? When pushed to the wall, the reflexes of the Congress party always seem to become anti-Hindu.
The Congress is led by Sonia Gandhi, a practicing Christian of Italian origin. In its leadership ranks, it has Ahmad Patel, Ghulam Nabhi Azad, AK Antony, and Manmohan Singh, all members of minorities. It has the ever-voluble Mani Shankar Aiyar and Digvijay Singh, both of whom never fail to chastise Hindus.
How in a country that is 80% Hindu do you then expect to win, Rahul?
You say you want to quit. But quitting under duress is not a sign of leadership. If you quit, you will surely bring in a Sitaram Kesri-like figure as president of the party. No one in the party is going to listen to him. As he becomes ensconced in his chair, he will start resenting the treatment that would be meted out to him. And so if you are thinking that after a few years you will come back as party president, you might be in for a shock.
Just as Sitaram Kesri was hard to displace from his chair, so too the new Sitaram Kesri might prove to be.
You have to be ruthless about the reasons for your defeat. First of course is your perceived anti-Hindu stance. God alone knows how that will be corrected or if you want it to be corrected given that your reflexive action was to choose a place like Wayanad.
Second, you seem to be trying to cast some spell of martyrdom over your family, particularly over yourself and your sister. There are martyrs in your family, but they are certainly not you or your sister. You and your sister ran a terrible campaign, calling the PM a chor when he patently is not, and you paid a price for it.
Now you are acting as if it is the fault of your party honchos and cadre that you lost. No, you lost because of you. Please look in the mirror and recognize that. When your grandmother lost in 1977, she took a hard look in the mirror and came roaring back in 1980. Please try to emulate her.
Third, I really do believe that Sonia Gandhi has become a liability for the Congress. She had her time and day from 1998 to 2004, after which she let UPA1 function relatively autonomously, but then she took over UPA2 by having her men installed in key positions in the PMO and by completely marginalising the PM. By doing so, she destroyed UPA2 and her party.
Fourth, of course is the Vadra question. You, your mom, and your sister believe he’s innocent. Well, then how did he make so much money so fast? It’s time for him to come clean. If he doesn’t, the BJP will continue to target him mercilessly, no matter how much you try to shield him.
Then of course there is the Priyanka question. She has utterly failed as a brahmastra in this election. In fact, the myth of her as brahmastra has imploded, and that is perhaps the most demoralizing aspect of the election for Congress supporters.
Lastly and certainly not the least is the big question. How are you going to bring back the moderate Hindu to your fold? The moderate Hindu sees the PM as an incorruptible, hard-working Hriday Hindu Samraat. He is not fazed by the odd hate lynching. He certainly doesn’t blame the PM for it.
He sees the biggest minority in this country as living in an island of its own. He feels the minority community doesn’t want to get a modern education. He feels that the minority community doesn’t plan its families. He feels that even an obviously egregious custom such as triple talaq is met with resistance from being banned from minority community leaders.
Lord William Bentick was governor-general of India from 1828 to 1835. In 1829 he banned sati. Today there are hardly any instances of sati in our vast land. Nehru passed the Hindu code bills after intense opposition from orthodox Hindus, who felt, perhaps rightly, that their community was the sole religious community that was being reformed. The bills allowed for divorce for the first time in Hindu history and banned polygamy from Hinduism.
Has polygamy been banned from Islam in India.
Senior Owaisi is an educated man. He feels that triple talaq is an unjust practice, but no one from outside the community should try to ban it. The community will reform itself from within. When did any community reform its bad practices from within?
This much credit you must give Hinduism, Rahul. It has always allowed for being reformed. The caste system is still a stain on it. The upper-caste Hindu still hesitates to marry a Dalit, but he is fine with being ruled by one. He would have loved to have a Muslim like Abdul Kalam as the prime minister of the country.
I am not sure what the solution to the woes of the Congress is, but of one thing I am sure. You have to shed the image of an anti-Hindu party. That doesn’t mean that you practice soft Hindutva, but that doesn’t also mean that you cloak yourself in Wayanad.

     While commenting on a loss, everyone is an expert. It is easy, because you can point to anything as the reason for the loss. However if you had done your research as you should have done, you would have heard about the EVM swap that took place and the 20 lakhs EVMâ  s that are missing. Read up about that and come back with a fresh perspective and realistic write up....  Read More

"1616952919-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/14/?s=triple+talaq","Abolish unjust Muslim Personal Law","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/satyam-bruyat/abolish-unjust-muslim-personal-law/","Abolish unjust Muslim Personal Law","June 13, 2014, 4:30 PM  IST","Markandey Katju","After my earlier post, many of my Muslim friends have criticized me alleging that I have no knowledge of Muslim Law.
Let me answer them by telling that I have studied Shariat Law first in the Allahabad university as a student of L.L.B. from 1965, then as a lawyer till 1991 in Allahabad High Court, and then as a Judge in the High Court and Supreme Court. Thus I was studying the Shariat perhaps even before these critics were born ( I am now 68 years old).
On the other hand, their comments indicate that they have little knowledge of Shariat, and have little modesty. Some of them say that talaq requires a long procedure. This is totally false. The truth is that it may require a long procedure for a Muslim woman wanting divorce because she has to file a petition in court under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, and it is well known that in our country court cases take several years to decide, and even thereafter there may be appeals and second appeals. However, a Sunni husband can immediately divorce his wife by a triple talaq (talaq ul bidat). Such a talaq is not valid according to Shia law, but it is valid according to Sunni schools of jurisprudence, as held in the Privy Council decision in Rashid Ahmad vs. Anisa, A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 25.
Though the preferred manner of divorce is talaq ahsan or talaq hasan, yet talaq ul bidat is good in law, and is the most common and prevalent mode of divorce in India vide Amiruddin vs. Khatun Bibi (1917) 39 All.371, 375. See in this connection Mulla’s Mahomedan Law, 19th edition, p.261, Ameer Ali’s Mahomedan Law, 5th edition,p. 1556, etc.
As regards Khula and mubarraat divorce, both require agreement between husband and wife . The main distinction between khula and mubarraat is that in the former the aversion is on the part of the wife alone, but in the latter, the aversion is mutual. In a khula divorce an offer has to be made by the wife to the husband for agreeing to divorce her on payment of compensation by her, vide Ghulam Sakuna v. Umar Baksh, A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 456 at p. 459.
In Mulla’s Principles of Mohamedan Law, 19th edition p. 265 it is stated that a Muslim marriage may be dissolved not only by talaq which is done unilaterally by the husband, but also by an agreement between husband and the wife. This agreement to dissolve the marriage may take the form of khula or mubarraat. Thus, in both khula and mubarraat there has to be an agreement between husband and wife. It follows, therefore, that if the husband does not agree there cannot be a khula or mubarraat divorce. In other words, khula and mubbarraat cannot be done unilaterally by the wife, unlike talaq which is done unilaterally by the husband. Hence the wife does not have the right to get a divorce even in khula form akin to the right of the husband.
All this indicates the inequality between man and woman in the shariat law of divorce. The Shariat was a creation of medieval times, when women were regarded as inferior to men. However, when society changes, the law too has to change, because the law reflects the social relations in a society at a particular stage of its historical development. Surely, laws made in Arabia in the 7th or 8th century cannot be applied in the 21st century. In the 7th or 8th centuries women were regarded as inferior to men, but the modern age is an age of equality and now discrimination against women is unacceptable, and has to be abolished.
I have mentioned all this in great detail because most of those who have criticized me have, at least by implication, indicated that a non-Muslim cannot be learned in Muslim Law, while a Muslim , who may not have studied Muslim law at all, by the mere fact that he is a Muslim, is an expert in Muslim law. This is obviously nonsense.
Those who know little or nothing of Muslim law, just because they are Muslims, do not become an expert on Muslim law. Such persons need to learn to be a little more modest and polite.
India is a secular country. Non-Hindus have a right to criticize bad and oppressive Hindu customs e.g. the caste system, and similarly non Muslims have a right to criticize bad Muslim customs or outdated, and oppressive Muslim laws and practices. Such criticism of bad customs and oppressive laws and practices do not amount to an attack on anyone’s religion.

"1616953664-204","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","Are we moving towards the clash of civilizations?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/ChanakyaCode/are-we-moving-towards-the-clash-of-civilizations/","Are we moving towards the clash of civilizations?","November 6, 2020, 3:07 PM  IST","SD Pradhan","The recent Islamist terrorist attacks in France and Vienna starting with the horrifying act of beheading of a teacher in France and the reactions in different parts of the world by some sections of Muslims remind what Samuel Huntington had envisaged for the post-cold war situation. He had concluded that while during the cold-war, the societies were divided on the basis of ideological differences, in the post-cold war period the political and ideological differences were no longer important. According to him, the new conflicts will occur along the boundaries of different cultures and patterns of cohesion will be found within the cultural boundaries. The current situation points towards emergence of such a scenario. The war between Azerbaijan and Armenia is already seen as a conflict between two cultures.
The beheading of the History teacher by a Chechen Muslim on the 16th Oct. was responded by President Macron’s order to close the Mosque with which the terrorist was linked and made a strong plea for taking action against acts of religious intolerance. He emphasised his nations’ resolve to assert the freedom of speech and supremacy of constitution. He disbanded the terrorist outfit ‘Gray Wolves’, that is radicalising Muslims in Europe, particularly of the Turkish origin. This is the militant arm of the Turkish Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which is an ally of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party). His proposal to defend the secular values of the country was welcomed by the Christians as an anti-terrorist law that was long overdue.
Soon after the incident of 16th Oct, another incident of religion-based violence occurred in Nice on the 29th Oct. in which an Islamic extremist from Tunisia ‘virtually beheaded’ a woman and killed two other French citizens attending a church function. On both the occasions, the attackers are reported to have shouted “Allahu Akbar” even when shot and arrested. Four years ago, Nice was the scene of terrorist attack, when a Tunisian drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on 14 July, killing 86 people.
The above incident was followed by yet another attack on the 2nd Nov. in Vienna by a person who was born and raised in Austria, unlike others who had come from outside. This man was earlier arrested for being a sympathiser of ISIS. The incident resulted in the death of 4 persons and another 15 were wounded. Subsequently, ISIS claimed on its propaganda outlet Amaq that it was behind the attack.
The reaction of the Muslims in several parts of the world to the French President’s order to assert constitutionalism over religious intolerance was disheartening. The world appears to be getting polarised on the basis of Muslim religion versus democracy based on secularism. This is a dangerous dimension of the shape of things to emerge. Several democratic countries condemned these dastardly acts and supported Macron, while Islamic countries like Turkey and Pakistan criticised Macron’s action. There were several who justified the beheading of the teacher. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that the Muslims have the right “to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past”. Erdogan stated that Macron needed his head examined and had lost his way, crossing all limits of diplomacy. He also called on Turks to boycott French goods.
India too, which has witnessed the worst kind of acts based on religious intolerance, supported Macron’s stance condemning the ghastly acts. However, some Muslim sections strongly reacted against Macron. In Mumbai at several places, posters of Macron were pasted on roads to insult him. Young children were seen protesting against Macron. Did they understand what had happened in France? Obviously, they were not aware of the whole episode but had been told to raise slogans against Macron and France. In Bhopal, a huge mob led by a Congress MLA protested against France. In Aligarh, a mob not only raised slogans against Macron but also demanded death penalty for him. The demand for boycott of the French products reached India from Muslim countries in which AIMPLB took the lead.
At a broader scale, a gulf between Islam and democratic societies is being created. While secular nations keep religion and governance separate, Muslims consider that religion should govern the state. Islamic theology recommends that Muslims should reside in Darul Islam or land of Islam. Non-Islamic states are perceived as Darul Harb or land of conflict. Hence, Muslims make serious endeavour to convert such states into Darul Islam and this leads to conflicts.
For secular states, it is unthinkable to have separate laws for different communities. However, in view of electoral politics, appeasement policy towards Muslims is adopted. In India, while polygamy was abolished in 1955, Muslims were allowed to have more than one wife. Even triple talaq was banned only recently inviting strong criticism from some Muslim leaders. The political parties which survive on the support of such elements, also advocate the policy of appeasement.
The manner in which selectively issues are being projected by Islamic states and Muslim leaders, is creating a narrative that pushes the Muslim youth towards radicalisation and they get attracted towards Islamic terrorist outfits like ISIS, Al Qaeda, JeM, LeT etc. By provoking sections of Muslims to condemn France or Macron or India for supporting the actions to protect constitution, they are injecting the poison of fundamentalism in the younger generation and providing the recruits for terrorist organisations. This is leading to a situation where a serious conflict falls within the realm of distinct possibility between the supporters of Islamic fundamentalists and the democratic world where pluralism is prevalent.
If we see the past, all religions have accepted reforms to do away with evil practices. At one point of time, the Hindu religion had a lot of evil practices like child marriage, sati practice, dowry system, ban on widow remarriage etc. Those who opposed these evil practices were called reformers and given honourable place in the society. These practices were done away with.
Similarly, the Christian religion also introduced reforms. Europe was once a victim of fundamentalism with a lot of interference of religion in the governance of states. Initially, those who opposed the religious interference were penalised. Later in the 17th century, with liberalism taking roots, the situation began to improve. Reforms were introduced and by the 20th century it became a multi-cultural and pluralist society.
Today because of violence by Islamic radicals, the situation in Europe is changing. The democratic countries see that that the radical Islamic forces desire to demolish the secular structure and therefore are gearing to unite to oppose the Islamic fascism. The Muslim community needs to ponder over whether involving the younger generation in hate protests is justified. A conflict between the Muslims and other religions is not in any one’s interest. Instead of producing terrorists, the Muslim youth should be trained to work for humanity.
One hopes that the Muslim community would soon see the game-plan of persons like Erdogan and Imran Khan as also some political leaders, who exploit the incidents to remain in power. They are certainly not the leaders of the entire Muslim community. It needs to be understood that democracy works as a bulwark against religion-based terrorism.

"1616953590-187","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=triple+talaq","Rahul Gandhi’s latest jibe could give another advantage to PM Modi","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/view-from-raisina/rahul-gandhis-latest-jibe-could-give-another-advantage-to-pm-modi/","Rahul Gandhi’s latest jibe could give another advantage to PM Modi","February 5, 2020, 11:28 PM  IST","Lakshmi Iyer","Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sent shock waves within the Congress as he personally targeted PM Modi ahead of Delhi Assembly elections once again handing a “ chowkidar chor hai” moment. Lashing out against Modi at an election rally in Delhi, he did the unthinkable. He threatened that youth of India would beat up the PM with danda and he would not be allowed to even leave his house.
Most senior Congress leaders were dumbstruck by Rahul’s utterances; how could he repeat the mistake of May 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Party sources point out how the Congress had lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections only because of the disastrous chowkidar chor hai campaign. “We dearly paid for this one slogan on Rafale, that one attack on the PM had put off people. Why is Rahulji repeating the mistake, “ lamented a Congress source.
Yet to give benefit of doubt to the Gandhi scion, Congressmen like to believe this “ un-Nehruvian” thought of bashing up PM Modi could not have been Rahul’s own idea. It must have been suggested by his lazy left-leaning speechwriter and he must have just repeated it.
At the same time, it is being felt the personal attack on the PM by Rahul could prove counter-productive for anti-CAA protests that the Congress has actively encouraged across the country. “ The anti-CAA protests are at a critical juncture. They were primarily initiated as an attempt to wean away Muslims who had been shifting to Modi between 2014 and 2019 because of a number of steps he had taken to improve their lot from Haj quota to triple talaq law. CAA is an important tool for us to win back Muslims across India. There should be no attack on the PM, “ admits a senior Congress leader.
So how will Rahul’s speech playout for the party in Delhi which goes to poll this weekend? Maybe not much as the Congress leadership seems more or less reconciled to a repeat of February 2015 results — that is a complete rout and hoping Kejriwal will make it with the overwhelming support of Muslims. Just as one more opinion poll – ABP News –C-Voter survey- predicts giving the party just 4 % vote share.
Delhi Congress top brass concede that 4% vote share was a sharp fall from the 22.50 per cent it had polled during May 2019 Lok Sabha polls when it had left Aam Admi Party way behind with 18.10 % votes as the third runner up. The BJP had won all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi and had polled 56 per cent. There is no delusion in the Congress that it will be even in a position to retain its vote share—that is why it had not even made the effort. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra stepped out for a breezy campaign in few select pockets in the last two days of the campaign, and most Delhi Congress leaders didn’t even know what was the basis of selecting these constituencies—be it Sangam Vihar or Jangpura. Unlike the BJP which has been working for weeks with ministers addressing nukkad meetings, Rahul and Priyanka ‘s campaign “ ended even before it began”. Asked if the party could score or be in reckoning even in any single-seat, a former Delhi Minister says “ If our vote share has dropped to 4% drastically since May 2019 because of Shaheen Bagh it must have gone to BJP.”

Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s meeting with a group of Muslim intelligentsia on July 11 as part of Congress’ pre-election outreach programme has created much ruckus. Headlines continue to focus on reactions from BJP leaders, the prime minister included, to Gandhi’s alleged comment made in a closeddoor meeting, quoted in the Urdu newspaper, The Inquilab, about Congress being a “Muslim party”. The paper actually quotes him as saying is, “If BJP says that Congress is a party of Muslims, that’s fine. Congress is a party of Muslims, because Muslims are weak and Congress always stands with the weak.”
But what stood out in Gandhi’s meeting was the conspicuous absence of conservative Muslims. This was in sharp contrast with what his father, Prime Minister and Congress president Rajiv Gandhi, did in the second half of the 1980s. That Rahul Gandhi didn’t have any pasmanda (‘backward’ Muslim) intellectual or activist in the meet is an indication that he has to learn even more. The absence of women’s rights activists barring the writers Farah Naqvi and Rakhshanda Jalil was also equally disappointing.
Does this indicate that the minorities cell of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) hasn’t done adequate homework on the issues of caste and gender among Muslims? Pasmanda voices have been growing louder since the 1990s, with the arzal (lower caste) segment pitching for its inclusion in the scheduled castes category for a while now. As are the growing voices demanding gender justice for Muslim women.
Writing on Gandhi’s July 11outreach, journalist and author on Congress affairs Rasheed Kidwai stated that “purely in terms of electoral strategy, Rahul’s Wednesday initiative lacked clarity and a sense of purpose ahead of 2019… the deletion of clergy and those with deep roots in society is inexplicable”.
This observation warrants two queries. One, did courting this conservative segment help Rajiv Gandhi in the 1980s, or actually spelt his doom in and after 1989? Two, in the current political scenario of bipolar politics, does the Muslim clergy — or, for that matter, any other group wishing to get rid of the current dispensation at the Centre — have any other option than siding with a Congress-led coalition for the 2019 elections?
Need Not Conserve

So, Rahul Gandhi has not erred by not engaging with Muslim conservatives. It was this section, lest one forgets, that had misled Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 to legislate a misogynist law against the Supreme Court verdict in the Shah Bano case. This wilful exercise of misleading Rajiv Gandhi comes out as an almost candid confession by the most powerful member of the Muslim clergy of the day, Ali Miyan Nadvi, in the third volume, fourth chapter of his Urdu memoir, Karwan-e-Zindagi (A Caravan of Life).
In today’s context, any such attempt by any party or political element to communalise politics — as was done during the Shah Bano episode — will eventually be helpful only to BJP.
The historian Syed Irfan Habib — not to be confused with the Aligarhbased Marxist historian — is reported to have aptly spoken out during the meeting with Rahul Gandhi that “the Congress should raise issues which are of concern to all the people of India and not just Muslims… [It] should talk about policies, employment, the atmosphere of fear and insecurity in which people are living… not only Muslims, but Dalits, too, are facing similar problems”.

Such advice is unlikely to have come from, say, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). Many AIMPLB members are, in fact, going about uttering the very polarising things that would help BJP. The board’s stance on the un-Quranic instant triple talaq (divorce), and the timing of it approving the setting up of five Darul Qaza (sharia courts) — five others being ‘under consideration’ — on July 15, without any attempt to dispel misgivings, are just a few instances.
The ‘Deen Bachao, Desh Bachao’ (Save the Faith, Save the Country) rally, led by AIMPLB general secretary Wali Rahmani in April in Patna, had ended with his protégé, Khalid Anwar, being nominated to the Bihar Legislative Council by NDA ally and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. All these moves simply suggest that ‘the Muslim clergy’ is composed of either politically naïve or opportunist people.
The absence of academics from the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) at the meeting with Rahul Gandhi is also interesting. In recent decades, AMU has not been an agent of change towards modernising India’s Muslims as it had in the past. Despite having large departments in law, theology, comparative religion, Islamic studies and the social sciences, hardly any voice against conservatism has come out of its campus for years.
All in a Play’s Work

Voices, as well as academic work, in AMU on caste and gender issues among India’s Muslims have been, for all purposes, silent. One of the few progressive voices, AMU alumnus and former students’ union president Arif Mohammad Khan, who represented Shah Bano in 1986, eventually suffered political oblivion.
Keeping all this in mind, contrary to some opinions doing the rounds today, Rahul Gandhi seems to have grown wiser in excluding the ‘same old, same old’ Muslim conservatives in the Congress outreach programme, so far.

While BJP and its partners are still short of a simple majority in the Rajya Sabha, the ruling party’s cause has been helped by non-aligned regional parties willing to offer it issue based support or strategic abstention, the latter also equally helping BJP.
While BJD supported the government, those opposed to the legislation like JD(U), AIADMK and TRS skipped the vote leaving the erstwhile “secular” consensus in shambles. Clearly, none of these parties “opposed” to the bill thought the cause was worth taking on BJP. The tendency to go with BJP was also noticed in the Right to Information Act amendment bill when parties like BJD, TRS and YSRCP supported the government.

With four TDP Rajya Sabha MPs crossing over to BJP and two Rajya Sabha MPs from Congress and Samajwadi Party resigning from the house, BJP is slowly inching towards the formidable 100 mark in the house which has a maximum strength of 243. With diminished strength in Parliament, the Congress-led opposition has no option but to strengthen its ground game outside.
BJP’s confidence is at an all-time high evident from the packed legislative agenda of the government in this session and the decision to prolong it. Yet it would do well to put bills to more house scrutiny through parliamentary committees, especially when the Rajya Sabha demands it. A large number of RS MPs represent the current state governments and it would be in the interest of federalism to respect the concerns of states.

That, despite the obvious danger she would ‘encounter’ if her cover was blown. But, as Maithili, she didn’t have to worry about being politically correct, whereas as Rana Ayyub she perforce needs to.
A year after the release of ‘Gujarat Files: Anatomy Of A Cover Up’, Ayyub, to many people, remains a “Muslim journalist stuck with the 2002 Gujarat riots”. She faces sexist and vicious trolls on a daily basis for not tweeting about an IS attack, triple talaq and other incidents where Muslims are allegedly involved. Recently, when Ayyub made public one of the sexually abusive trolls, a Malayali man behind the message was deported from UAE.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-87419"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rana-ayyub.jpg"" alt="""" width=""501"" height=""638"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rana-ayyub.jpg 501w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rana-ayyub-236x300.jpg 236w"" sizes=""(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"">

“I personally have the added responsibility of proving my nationalism because I am Rana Ayyub,” says Ayyub, currently an independent columnist, and who had come to Thiruvananthapuram to deliver a talk on ‘Nationalism: Discourse and Contestation’ organised by Samagati – a group of young intellectuals – on Friday.
Gujarat Files, that became a bestseller due to its explosive content about the alleged role of then chief minister Narendra Modi and BJP strongman Amit Shah, is about how Ayyub, accompanied by a French assistant, pieces together what happened during the riots by coaxing top bureaucrats and police who had worked in Gujarat between 2001 and 2010 to confide. “If there is a single incorrect fact, Modi or Shah could have dragged me to court. But they won’t do that because they don’t want media attention for the book,” Ayyub says.
She is understandably concerned that the Gujarat riots shouldn’t be subject to selective amnesia on the part of the intelligentsia which is scared of provoking the powers-that-be. At the same time, Ayyub is chary of calling the event a ‘genocide’, a term that would go beyond mere semantics and brand the riots as a crime against humanity with its attendant implications. “It is too premature for me to call it a genocide. It is for an investigative body to find out whether it was a genocide or not. Through the events listed in the book, I call it a state-sponsored pogrom. More than a year after my book has released, the SIT has not approached me or enquired anything about the revelations,” Ayyub explains.
For her, the graphic narration of the Gujarat killings by officials was not a new story. As a nine-year-old child, she had first-hand experience during the Bombay riots. She was shifted to a safer house for a month where she lived without any contact from her parents. “I lived in an RSS-dominated area in Bombay. On Guru Poornima, people would come to tie rakhi on my father’s hand as he was a teacher. It stopped since December 6, 1992,” she recalls.
In Gujarat, however, the scale of what was happening traumatised her. “Top police officers would tell me how they loved Muslims being taught a lesson and I would say ‘wow’. A part of me would cringe inside,” Ayyub reveals. Asked on how she would explain mass participation of ordinary Hindus in the riots and whether she would agree that there was something in the Muslim community’s need to maintain a separate and distinct identity that can be ‘provocative’, that can act as a trigger for long-simmering resentments, Ayyub demurs. “The Gujarat riot was a result of the mass furore created by people like Modi and Shah who rallied with the bodies of Godhra train burning to instigate people to come out. The pattern is same in all riots – be it 1984 Sikh riot or Gujarat riot, the leader will sit in office and pull the trigger. People are given a message that their identity is under attack,” she says.
Explaining the background of how she chose her undercover identity, Ayyub said that the surname Tyagi was purposefully chosen as Tyagi is a caste that is placed between Brahmin and OBC. “So I had direct access to both Brahmin and OBC officers in Gujarat,” she says. On the caste connection in the riots, Ayyub points out that most officers who connived in the riots were from OBCs as they wanted to please those in power to get promotions that would otherwise be denied by their Brahmin superiors.
“Gujarat Files for me is an act of nationalism in itself…People call me an activist. I am not an activist but I am an active journalist,” clarifies Ayyub. She scoffs at BJP’s current effort to ban triple talaq, saying that the same people who are now concerned about Muslim women are the ones who did the unspeakable to women like Kausar Bi, Ishrat Jahan and Bilkis Bano.

Indian politics has always sabotaged gender justice for Muslim women. But the Supreme Court does not have to woo Muslim vote banks, and can be objective.
The mullahs are livid, of course. Kamal Farooqi of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board says, “This will mean direct interference of the government in religious affairs as Sharia religious law is based on the Quran and Hadith, and its jurisprudence is strong as far as Islam is concerned. It will be against the constitutional right to religious freedom.”
Sorry, but the Constitution makes it very clear that freedom of religion does not override fundamental rights, and does not bar reforms of traditional religious practices. Sharia law may permit the stoning to death of a woman for adultery, but our secular laws ban that. Sharia law may call for the amputation of fingers or hand of a thief, but not our secular laws. Sharia law may prohibit interest on loans, but Muslims giving or taking loans are subject to laws on interest payments.
Now, religious minorities have been allowed to continue with traditional personal laws on matters like marriage and inheritance. Jawaharlal Nehru had the courage to amend Hindu personal law, outlawing polygamy and providing female rights to inherit property, divorce, and remarry. Alas, he funked similar reforms for Muslims, leaving Muslim women as oppressed and subjugated as ever.
A Directive Principle of the Constitution says the state shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code throughout India. This has never been implemented. Muslim conservatives are dead opposed. Religious objections apart, they say a civil code will become a form of Hindu oppression.
Some enlightened Muslims have urged modernization of Islamic personal law. But secular political parties know that conservatives control the Muslim vote, and woo them by saying Muslims themselves must take the initiative on reforms. In effect, secular parties have thrown Muslim women to the wolves in search of votes.
The BJP is the only party backing a common civil code, but its strong anti-Muslim instincts lead one to suspect it is keener on bashing Muslims than ending gender oppression.

Oral triple talaq permits a man to utter three times that he is divorcing his wife, and she is at the mercy of his whims. In our travels through India, my late wife Shahnaz often spoke to Muslim women, who invariably said that one of the greatest injustices they faced was the ever-present threat of triple talaq. The same fears are expressed by Shayara Bano in her Supreme Court petition. “They (women) have their hands tied while the guillotine of divorce dangles perpetually ready to drop at the whims of their husbands who enjoy undisputed power.”
Women constitute half the Muslim population, but have no voice because of male subjugation. Politicians who say Muslims don’t want to reform personal laws are thinking only of male Muslims, not female Muslims. When oppressive Muslim laws keep women under the thumbs of men, they cannot express their true wants and have to follow male orders. Conservative Muslims have historically discouraged female education, keeping women disempowered and unable to strike out on their own.
If a referendum with secret voting is held among Muslim women, they will surely opt to abolish triple talaq and polygamy. But they are not given the chance. So they remain disempowered and subjugated,with the shameful complicity of secular parties claiming to represent universal rights.
The 2012 Committee on the Status of Women has made gender recommendations covering all religions. It seeks to ban triple talaq and polygamy. It seeks stronger provisions for maintenance payments to women and children (these can currently be cut off if a divorcee is “unchaste”). The Supreme Court should heed the report.
Forget the propaganda that a common civil code will mean Hindu oppression. Goa is the only state that disallows personal laws of all religions. It has a uniform civil code — with a few exceptions not relevant to Muslims — based on Portuguese colonial laws. Goa’s mullahs sought to extend Muslim personal law to Goa after liberation from Portuguese rule, but happily were foiled by the Goa Muslim Women’s Associations and Muslim youth activists. Muslims account for 8.3% of Goa’s population, and are a prosperous community. The civil code has not oppressed Goan Muslims or forcibly Hinduised them.
Any fear that a uniform civil code will mean Hindu oppression of Muslims will be exposed as groundless if India simply follows Goa’s example. The Supreme Court should point all political parties in Goa’s direction.

It was not only an ecstatic victory for Shayara Bano, and thousands of Muslim women whose rights had been violated but another step towards women empowerment for the nation as a whole. The honourable Supreme Court had declared the judgement after which, the onus fell on the Parliament to draft the legislation. The resultant legislation i.e. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, was not in any way congruent to the purpose it was meant to serve. The legislation that was supposed to ensure equality and protection of women’s rights seems more inclined to be a legal clean chit for detaining Muslim men and lacking any concern for the aggrieved women. The multiple erratic legal and logical loopholes in the legislation make its purpose ambiguous and rationale, perplexing.

The fundamental incongruity with this bill is that it stands on the ledge of divorce by voiding instant triple talaq as per the direction of Supreme Court but simultaneously effectively legitimizing it by directing about custody and maintenance, which does not come into the picture if the talaq does not happen. The criminalisation i.e. the prison term for the man pronouncing triple talaq is again a logical fallacy with serious consequences on the future of the aggrieved woman because firstly, if the dissolution of marriage never takes place, since triple talaq is deemed ‘void’, then what actually does the legislation criminalise? Is it the ‘intention’ of dissolution (amounting to oppression) or is it the mere utterance of the word ‘talaq’ thrice (which now, legally, holds no meaning)? Neither fails to justify the reason behind criminalisation. As has already been submitted to the union cabinet by the WCD Ministry, if it is the intention of oppression that the bill seeks to criminalise, it would fall within the purview of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code – “Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty”, making the new legislation just a stretch to aid communal politics.
Moreover, it fails to address the gruesome reality of the households where a practice like triple talaq is intended. Women in these households have been oppressed for years. Let alone them even being exposed to education and employment, their two square meals are also entirely dependent on their abusive husbands.  Since the legislation keeps the divorce void, it fails to bring permanent relief. If it seeks a temporary relief for three years, it fails to acknowledge the practicality of the situation, since by putting behind the bars the only source of income for these women, it only makes their livelihood and sustenance problematic. The cabinet has countered this by alluding to the clause in the bill that ensures maintenance for the wife by her husband during the jail term, but that again is a preposterous argument, since how will a man in prison, earn in the first place to pay maintenance?
There is a popular jurisprudential theory in policymaking “Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex” i.e. if the reason for a law ceases to exist, the law ceases to exist too. The Supreme Court’s judgement by abolishing the evil practice of triple talaq has left no reason to overstretch it to something that can be misused. The criminalisation of triple talaq as a cognizable offence, on the facade, is being viewed by some as a strong force protecting women’s rights but only a deeper understanding vindicates that it is completely anathema to the purpose of the bill i.e. women empowerment.
Law-making and politics should remain two separate entities which this bill seems to have intermingled. This was supposed to be a legislation to safeguard the Supreme Court’s decision but is rather a statement of the ruling party’s predilections towards communities, with the vote bank in mind. In a country where the legislature represents the will of the nation and ensures the protection of every citizen’s interest, it is eminent for our parliamentarians to leave their parties’ respective interests to stay in power, outside the four walls of the parliament and for us as citizens to question law-making with a coherent mindset, leaving all prejudices.

It is important to introspect how far we have fulfilled his vision. He stood for modern education, scientific temper and reinterpreting Quran in light of modern knowledge.
For Sir Syed, the trauma of Indian Muslims after the failed 1857 uprising against the British called for education and social reforms among Muslims in India. He drew upon Islam’s rationalist tradition, and advocated a radical reinterpretation of Quran to make it compatible with post-Renaissance western humanistic and scientific ideas, and also to wean the ‘truth’ from fossilised dogma.
Aligarh Muslim University stands testimony to Sir Syed’s quest for reforms in education. It has been the fulcrum of education amongst Muslims in the subcontinent. AMU as an educational institution not only weathered the storms of Partition but also progressed from strength to strength. However, the vision of Sir Syed went beyond an institution to impart education to one which would spearhead social reforms amongst Muslims in the subcontinent. Unfortunately, AMU has been inefficacious in this role of being the incubator of social reforms.
Though the university boasts of a theology department, it functions more as a centre for management of religious life in the campus than for reformation of Islamic jurisprudence in the country. Consequently, Muslim personal laws in India are amongst the most conservative in the world.
Interestingly, many of the laws that Muslims in India are so sensitive about are actually a result of the conservative interpretations by colonial British judges. The Britishers during the period 1820-57 were at the forefront of reformation of many religious practices in the subcontinent. This included the abolition of sati and support to widow remarriages. However, this interference in religious practices was perceived to be a major reason for the revolt of 1857. As a result, post 1857, the Britishers were wary of taking up cudgels for social reforms and compromising their own position, and subsequently they sided with the conservative and orthodox sections of Indian society.
This led to a very orthodox codification of Muslim personal laws. The judgment of the Bombay high court in the case of Tajbi Abalal Desai vs Mowla Ali Khan Desai (1917) by the B Scott and Beaman bench is a quintessential case in point, as it laid the foundation for a conservative polygamy law. Orthodox codification is also exemplified in the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937.
Post-Independence, the personal laws of other religions were amended and reformed in the face of the stiff resistance from conservative sections of society. However, successive governments thought it best not to intervene in the domain of Muslim personal laws and left their interpretations in the hands of the Muslim Personal Law Board.
This has led to a situation where Muslim personal laws in many of the perceived conservative Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan and Iraq, were reformed and many practices including triple talaq and polygamy were either banned or restricted; but in India these practices and the Muslim personal laws still reflect the colonial orthodox interpretation.
With successive governments keeping a safe distance from getting involved in the reformation of Muslim personal laws, under normal circumstances the onus would lie on the liberal intelligentsia. However, post-Partition such a Muslim intelligentsia was non-existent in India, as the elite among the Muslims had migrated to Pakistan. The absence of such a pressure group further contributed to the lack of a voice for social reforms among Muslims.
In this scenario, AMU had a very crucial role to play. However, AMU, grappling with its own existential questions and identity crisis could not provide the role Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had envisaged for it and ceded space to the Deoband and other more orthodox centres in the country.
Recently, issues related to polygamy have been contested in the Supreme Court and the government has contended that the validity of triple talaq and polygamy has to be seen in light of gender justice, equality and dignity of women. It is a great opportunity for Muslims in India to reimagine and reinterpret their personal laws to correctly reflect the teachings of Quran and not the blinkered interpretation of some colonial British judge. Sir Syed had stood for such a reinterpretation in the 19th century but we have failed to achieve it in two centuries.
AMU needs to step up and play a very important role, not just by providing the correct interpretations of Quran but more importantly by being the harbinger of a Muslim social revolution. The university has immense goodwill among the Muslim community in the country and by being the voice of change it can convince the Muslims of the country to embrace this reformation. The chances of Muslims consenting to any change in personal laws are much higher if AMU spearheads it.
Two centuries is a very long time. Sir Syed must be turning in his grave (located in the AMU campus itself) that what he stood for is still only being read as the ‘Aligarh Movement’. If we are able to reform the laws related to triple talaq and polygamy and bring them in consonance with the laws in liberal Muslim countries before next year’s bicentennial celebrations of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, it will be the greatest tribute to the man.

Maulanas and clerics are not leaders here; instead, youth and home-makers are. These are not “Muslim” mobilisations as earlier seen against Salman Rushdie, triple talaq or Taslima Nasrin. Instead, this new inclusive movement is one where Bhim Army’s Chandrashekhar Azad — and not the Shahi Imam — has addressed crowds at Jama Masjid. Students and citizens from all communities have joined in raising the non-denominational slogan — azaadi.
Protesters make a crucial argument: given the foundational constitutional principle of all religions being equal before the law, India’s Parliament cannot, in the 21st century, insert religious discrimination into any legislation.
It’s a protest armed with nothing but the Preamble. Clothes do not matter; jeans, jackets and hijab co-exist. Importantly, the women of Shaheen Bagh or software professionals in Bangalore or students of Jamia, have little truck with old-style victimhood. Instead, theirs is a forceful declaration of equal citizenship by patriotic Indians.
At protest sites youngsters are lining up to have their faces painted with the Tricolour, something normally seen during cricket matches or Independence Day. At Shaheen Bagh, there’s an installation of India Gate and giant India maps. Posters of freedom heroes Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar and Maulana Azad are depicted standing together. Claiming all of them together — something conventional politicians don’t — is what makes the protest ideologically unique.
In Hyderabad, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi is organising Tiranga rallies and plans to light up Charminar in Tricolour on Republic Day. In Mumbai’s Dharavi, Muslim slum-dwellers stand with their Marathi manoos neighbours, chanting patriotic songs. AIMIM’s Waris Pathan has yelled that others may migrate to Australia and America but the Indian Muslim will never leave his beloved Bharat.
Is it fear that is pushing Muslims to make these declarations of patriotism? BJP may argue that its precisely these declarations of ‘loyalty to India’ from Muslims which the party has always pushed for. Yet there’s no fear in the Muslims’ open defiance of the prejudice that has been consistently directed at them. Instead, there’s an unwillingness to succumb to stereotyping and demonising. At the same time there’s a deep yearning for cross-community brotherhood, to align with other inclusive patriots. Said a protester: ‘Enough is enough. Didn’t we remain quiet after the Ayodhya judgment? Didn’t we remain quiet even though many of our businesses were ruined after cattle trade laws? Didn’t we remain quiet when the only Muslim majority state was split into UTs? Have we not consistently spoken of peace after bloody assaults? Now when our citizenship itself is being questioned, we will not fight shy of voicing a cry of both anger and of intense belonging to our homeland.”
This cry is directed not only against saffron majoritarianism, but also against those within the Muslim community — notably, intellectuals like the late Syed Shahabuddin who insisted on a ‘Muslim’ identity ahead of an ‘Indian’ one. The slogan, ‘Hindustan ke chaar sipahi, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isaai’, is regularly raised in Shaheen Bagh, emphasising that inter-community partnership built free India.
Instances of violence and radicalised politics in UP, West Bengal and Mangaluru have taken away some of the movement’s moral dignity. Yet the overwhelming majority of the protests have remained non-violent and may even have the potential to renew faith in conscientious non-violent civic action. The onus is now on the majority community: can Hindus embrace this call for the Constitution and shun the regressive stereotypes propagated by politicians who believe “protesters can be recognised by their clothes”?
The ruling BJP has internalised the lexicon of British imperialists. The scholarly book ‘Beyond Turk and Hindu’ shows how British colonial census takers, in pursuit of ‘divide and rule’, froze Indians into watertight silos of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’. Before the British, the subcontinent was a free give and take of broad “Islamicate” and “Indic” people. The protests evoke those age-old ties and stake a claim to Muslims’ long-held place in India’s history.
It’s a mistake to see the protests as a “Muslim” issue. It would also be a mistake for protesters to descend into narrow identity politics. At the moment, there’s a striving for modern constitutional values and strong rejection of the two-nation theory. In fact, the protests are an opportunity for the emergence of an active new Muslim citizenship beyond the majority-minority divide because this movement asserts that the patriotism of the Indian Muslim is in no way lesser than the deshbhakti voiced by Indian Hindus. A powerful sentiment courses through the protests: garv se kaho hum Indian Muslim hain.

Speaking at a rally in Himachal Pradesh which has a significant population in the armed forces, in an apparent reference to the strikes, Modi stated that the world is now talking about the Indian Army. He compared the Army’s strikes to Israel which often carries out successful covert operations as part of their national security. This reveals his game plan of reaping maximum benefit for electoral gains.
<img src=""http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo/48703302.cms"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" class="""">
His cabinet colleague and defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, has not missed any opportunity to give credit to Modi’s decisive leadership in conducting the strikes. His latest assertion is that teaching of RSS has been at the core of Modi and his decision making in going ahead with the strikes. All this seems to be a part of a calculated strategy to extract every ounce of political mileage from the surgical strikes before assembly elections in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh.

Till now, BJP was plagued with many ills which included the death of Dalit scholar, Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad and public flogging of Dalits in Gujarat’s Una town earlier this year. For a party that won all the 17 reserved Lok Sabha seats in UP, the going appeared tough as Dalits seemed to be consolidating behind Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The lack of a chief ministerial face was also hampering their chances against the known faces of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav from Samajwadi Party (SP) and BSP supremo Mayawati.

The surgical strikes have given a new impetus to BJP where the focus is to re-emphasise Modi’s muscular image coupled with jingoism being echoed by the likes of Parrikar, BJP president Amit Shah, and Home minister Rajnath Singh in their statements. Parrikar has even gone to the extent of claiming that this was the first time ever that such strikes were carried out. Though this has been questioned by opposition and security experts, the idea behind it is to deny any political dividend to other parties.

The issue of triple talaq, debate on Uniform Civil Code and Centre’s decision to build a magnificent Ramayana Museum in Ayodhya is aimed at keeping ultra-right wing organisations in good humour. This also gives BJP enough leeway to distance itself from the construction of Ram temple issue and yet offer hope to its core constituency that Modi will ultimately deliver in the coming years. For now, Modi seems more than happy to cash in on the popular mood after the strikes.

"1616953038-59","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/12/?s=triple+talaq","What lies behind the enduring popularity of the PM?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/strategic-insights/what-lies-behind-the-enduring-popularity-of-the-pm/","What lies behind the enduring popularity of the PM?","May 22, 2017, 4:45 PM  IST","Sunil Sharan","It is completely mystifying, that despite GST being the only achievement to his credit, Mr. Modi’s popularity is as high as it has ever been. Let’s examine some of the reasons why:
–The PM is a great orator: If not in the league of Vajpayee, but certainly up there with Barack Obama, if not more. The flailing of arms, the head swaying from left to right and from right to left, the high-low low-high intonation, the weaving of dreams, the spinning of yarns, the perfect Hindi. His audience loves it. No one in the political firmament except Priyanka Gandhi Vadra comes close.
– The move to soft Hindutva: Let the hardliners do their cow vigilantism and triple talaqism. Then the PM can always move in to talk soft on any disruptive issue, and appear, moderate and conciliatory.
– The deal-making: Donald Trump thinks that he has the art of the deal, but it is Mr. Modi who has it down pat. The partnership with Mehbooba Mufti, the compromise with Nagpur to elevate Adityanath, the bonding with Nawaz Sharif.
– The pragmatism: Criticize Mnrega, Aadhar, GST all you want while in opposition, but quickly co-opt them and make them your own once in power.
– The moral high ground: Let Arvind Kejriwal say all kinds of vicious things about you; greet him on his birthday and make him look like the political novitiate that he is. No one really has anything nasty to say about the PM anymore, including Sonia “Maut ke saudagar” Gandhi or Mamta Didi.
– The personal integrity: With no progeny, and other family living in as obvious modest status as before, no one doubts the personal financial integrity of the man.
– The get-up: Although without any partner to help him, loves to dress up. The Modi kurta, the Ray Bans, the shawls, the suits, the personal inscriptions (oh no, not that!). Indians are floored by their fashionable leader.
– The fitness: Yoga mania keeps him fit as a fiddle and seemingly good for 15 more years. Could work a bit on the expanding girth though.
– The one and only ruler: Indians, like many other people, want one person in charge. Sonia-Manmohan demeaned the prime ministership for a decade. With the PM’s face plastered in your hand (your mobile), your home (your newspaper, TV), your hoarding, your bus stop, he ubiquitously reminds you, night and day, that he is the one and only one.
– The close-knit circle: Two billionaire advisors, one Man Friday, all speaking the same language. That’s it. Everyone else is not just expendable, but redundant as well. Close circle ensures no leaks, and enables unity of purpose.
– The travel: Air India One has got so fatigued that it has been retired from service in place of better, faster, newer supersonic jets. Loves to hug foreign leaders, even if caught in awkward poses sometimes. Indians love the glamour of international travel, and if they cannot do it themselves, at least they can derive vicarious pleasure from their ruler.
So, there you are. Despite the economy not growing fast enough, despite “surgical” strikes going awry, despite achche din still being a mirage for the common man, the PM’s achche din are here to stay. Go figure.

Justice J Chelameswar, the seniormost judge after CJI Misra, a judge who has actively taken on the role of reforming the secretive collegium, was slated to hear the matter with five senior SC judges, setting the stage for an explosive outcome, but CJI Misra intervened, exercised his authority as master of roster and another bench finally heard and disposed of the matter with a Rs.25 lakh fine on Prashant Bhushan and company. Justice Chelameswar, who has nearly six months of tenure left, may also pay a heavy price but that remains to be seen.
The denouement was clearly not satisfactory but the perception that the judiciary managed the crisis without other arms of the state or civil society intervening has helped normalcy return. It remains to be seen whether the central government pursuing structural reforms in the economy has some appetite to attempt judicial reforms like the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, which will create structures to probe similar complaints, but the quashing of the National Judicial Appointments Committee Act and the absence of public outrage may deter the government from tinkering too much with judicial autonomy. Nevertheless, the collegium has shown some capacity for internal reform and forstering transparency by deciding to publish its recommendations on elevation or rejection of judgeship candidates.
The right to privacy judgment, decided 9-0, will rank among the finest moments for the judiciary. In a time when there appears to be little control over private data with governments, corporations, and criminals laying claim to it, the judgment written by Justice Chandrachachud for three more judges describes privacy as the “constitutional core of human dignity” protecting “heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture”. He has also defined three zones – intimate, private and public – where privacy operates, thereby offering conceptual and operational clarity on how privacy expectations vary.
The triple talaq judgment was a case of ends justifying the means. Three judges ruled in favour of outlawing triple talaq while two – the minority – said this would be a violation of religious freedoms. More intriguingly, one of the three judges who outlawed triple talaq ruled with the minority against any violation of religious freedoms but he could not locate triple talaq in core Islamic texts  and hence banned it. There was much heartburn that triple talaq was outlawed in this fashion without an outright majority judgment based on right to equality before law and right against discrimination.
Weighty matters await Supreme Court in 2018. The hearing on the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi title dispute is poised to resume. SC must also decide whether the fetish with linking Aadhaar to all sorts of services, as has been progressing in recent months, is in consonance with the Aadhaar Act. There has not been much improvement in filling the vacancies in high courts. 392 of 1079 sanctioned high court judges post are lying vacant translating to a vacancy rate of 37%. Six of 31 positions are also lying vacant in Supreme Court. The Memorandum of Procedure also continues to hang fire. CJI Misra must settle this outstanding business with the government and work out a way to fill appointments as soon as retirements occur.

     Nearly two out of five posts lying vacant in the high courts, where the majesty of the higher judiciary begins, adds immeasurably to the average citizen's wait for justice. MoP is not reason enough to hold up appointments. That should qualify as a solemn New Year resolution....  Read More

In the ivory high-rise we live in, political activity is restricted to resident welfare associations (RWAs), and interactions with RSS swayamsevaks who come calling during elections to preach the virtues of voting, and how this strengthens the nation. Which is why it was surprising to hear slogans last week like ‘We want justice’ and ‘Azadi!’ from a lively bunch as they marched down the ‘road below’.
The protest was perplexing — especially considering Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) does not have a satellite campus. In recent years, public activism has become a strict no-no in most residential colonies, typifying urban India’s middle-class cocoons. Since most residents equate any form of protest with ‘anti-nationalism’, however, why did the rape and murder of the young veterinarian in Hyderabad incense people so much that they came out on the streets in protest — and later, to publicly rejoice the reported ‘encounter’ killings of the perpetrators?
Were these one-off demonstrations organised by conscientious citizens? Or were they indicative of subtle shift in people’s attitude to State power and the broadening of their concerns? Theorising on the basis of ‘anecdotal evidence’ is fraught with dangers. But there is certainly a need to examine the extent to which such protests can be linked to BJP’s recent political setbacks.
Arguably, below-par performance in Maharashtra, and being forced to accept a coalition partner primarily representing Jats in Haryana, indicates the political tide turning somewhat against the party. The subsequent political adventurism in Maharashtra, too, embarrassingly backfired.
These developments will influence Jharkhand’s ongoing polls, and will likely to also have a bearing on BJP’s fortunes in Delhi polls in February. It does not help that economic news everywhere has ‘distress’ as a common headline.
Although GoI has taken several measures to boost the economy, the old cheer is missing. Coming barely six months after registering a superlative electoral tally, and also keeping the nationalistic narrative up and running by suspending Article 370 on J&K and having the Ayodhya verdict ‘go its way’, there are sufficient reasons for BJP to worry.
This, however, is not the first time BJP is confronted with a challenge while in office at the Centre. In 2015, when still politically ascendant, the party suffered humiliating defeats in Delhi and Bihar.
These losses coincided with sections of the intelligentsia rediscovering their voice and protesting against alleged ‘minority profiling’ and targeted attacks. Yet, BJP steadied its ship, pursued policies of its choice, secured greater ideological support, and won state elections.
The party again went through a slump from the autumn of 2017. The ‘barely respectable’ performance in Gujarat, followed by several defeats in bypolls, and being voted out of power in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, boxed BJP in an unenviable position.
When asked about the party’s ‘nightmare situation’, a senior party leader responded by saying that Lok Sabha polls were being reduced to an ‘aggregate of 543 elections’. Opinion polls suggested India was, indeed, moving towards that scenario, as economic woes mounted and people began to look at their bottom line, rather than towards matters of national ‘pride’ and security.
Eventually, the terrorist strike in Pulwama in February 2019, GoI’s retaliation in Balakot, and the swift return of captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman enabled Modi to personally script a high-decibel campaign based on national security and pride. It bore dividends, the extent of which few anticipated. Sensing an ideological tilt in its favour, BJP pressed on core items in its Hindutva agenda.
By the time elections were called in Maharashtra and Haryana, most Indians had turned fatalistic. The PM downward, many prominent BJP leaders cited decisions on Kashmir and the criminalisation of instant triple talaq, among other issues, to showcase the party’s commitment to a certain form of nationalism.
Yet, as bypolls in West Bengal also revealed, there are limits to ideology driving state elections, not to mention support to some of BJP’s ideological pursuits.
Witness, for instance, state leaders asserting that Trinamool Congress gains in all three seats were due to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) going on an overdrive. Furthermore, voters in Maharashtra and Haryana were guided more by local concerns and less by national ‘achievements’ that BJP had listed.
Prior to polling in the two western states, many concluded that BJP merely needed to spin one ‘Hindutva narrative’ after another to keep winning elections. Recent developments, however, require BJP to assess if the law of diminishing returns applies to ideological accomplishments, too. Additionally, if after ‘settling’ matters pertaining to inter-community relations, are people beginning to be guided more by livelihood and other concerns? Does Shiv Sena remaining devoted to Hindutva — as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced after breaking with BJP and forming government in Maharashtra — neutralise Modi’s advantage?
Do the street protests mirror an emerging reality? There are no immediate answers. But recent developments will force soul-searching in every party, including BJP.

And there is an India we constantly dream of. And of course there is an India the world sees. All three are different. We talk of one India while thinking about another. We budget for one India and then go spend it on another. We worry about one India, boast about the other. What confuses us even more is there is an India that once was, which some of us still yearn for and want to return to.
This is actually an Asian dilemma. We cannot forget our hoary past. We are not exactly delighted with the present. And we forever dream of the future. At the same time, we have to deal with what others think of us. Not just deal with it but also respond to it; at times we do it with anger and at times, as a business opportunity. So while we may disapprove of Mughal India, our biggest tourist attraction remains the Taj.
Those like me, who live in the India that is, are often called whiners. I get tweets that ask me if I see nothing good around me. It’s tough to explain to them that the India they are boasting about is not the India I live in. I am equally proud of my India but my India needs to be repaired, to be set right. It needs water. Its forests need to be protected. Its species need to be nurtured, not culled. It needs, above all, greater compassion towards all those struggling to stay alive. Not boastful claims of being the world’s fastest growing economy, which it well may be. But as long as it does not make life any better for the poorest and the weakest among us, that growth means nothing. It’s just a stupid number.
But no, I don’t blame those who see me as a whiner because they live in a different India. It’s an India propelled by fantastic political promises and a media that fuels them. My India, truth be spoken, is what you see around you, not what you fantasize about. It is the India you and I live in: a bit broken, a bit lost, a bit scary. It hits the headlines for all the wrong reasons. It lives in the shadows of poverty, grief, suicides, rapes. The heroes in my India are those who can survive it all and yet hold their heads high.
Are Governments only to blame? Perhaps not. Every nation has a burgeoning middle class that lives off hope. And politicians cater to that hope. They lie. They fantasize. They misinform, mislead, misguide. But, in the process, they fulfill a crucial function. They feed the dreams of people who have little else to see them through life. They give them slogans. They proffer them reasons to hate others who are different from them. Both politics and history have demonstrated, again and again, that anger binds more people than love. Love is what we idealize. Hate is what we feed on. Give people a good reason to hate and they will buy into it, even if they know you are manipulating them. In both love and politics, people enjoy being manipulated.
But those who see you from the outside are not easy to manipulate. That’s why there is another India too. The India others see us as. No, I am not talking about NRIs. Their worldview is tainted by nostalgia. I am talking about the world at large. They see an India that is different. We may not agree with their idea of India but we cannot ignore it either, for their perceptions drive our trade, affirm our stature in the world, and (most important) define our sense of self esteem. Whether we like it or not, we always see ourselves through the eyes of others. That is why we get angry with people like Wendy Doniger or Leslee Udwin or James Laine. We claim it is their prejudice that offends us. But it’s actually the doubts they raise in our own minds about our self image.
At the same time, we live in an India that exists in several centuries. This makes things even more complex. Different people worship differently. Different people think differently, believe in different things. And some of the things they believe in are part of our past. But we refuse to acknowledge that. We live with our past as if it is our present and we can build our future on it. So the Ram Mandir becomes crucial in UP, Jallikattu is vital in Tamil Nadu, the triple talaq exists as an intrinsic part of religious identity, and female genital mutilation survives because no one wants to tamper with faith. Honour killings, caste prejudice, violence against women, ostracism of the third gender, harassment of minorities, killing rationalists: these are part of a decadent historic agenda we are still trying to live out even as we dream of becoming one of the world’s great economic powers.
Which India do you live in? Which India do you want to live in? In which India flutters that flag under which you stand? Maybe there is no clear answer to that. But look within your heart and you will find the India you love.

Post-May 23, India’s main opposition parties seem to be imploding. Congress is reeling from the dual trauma of an electoral rout and a petulant Rahul Gandhi; the Samajwadi Party-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh has collapsed, as have the anti-BJP alliances in Bihar and Jharkhand; the Left has been obliterated; and Mamata Banerjee has lost her composure. True, there are regional parties that have significant parliamentary presence and are buoyant in their respective states, but their principal focus is regional. They have minimal national expectations and are willing to forge working relationships with the Centre.
Despite agonised voices lamenting India’s democratic future, the situation isn’t unprecedented. There was no worthwhile national opposition from 1947 to 1967, and again in the aftermath of the 1971 and 1984 elections. However, and certainly after 1967, parliamentary dominance didn’t automatically generate either stability or purposeful governance. After Indira Gandhi, the Congress proved incapable of supplementing electoral victories with political consolidation. Flagship welfare schemes, such as MNREGA, did not succeed in providing it an assured national constituency of the rural poor in the same way as Operation Barga did for the CPM in West Bengal. Most of the gains were squandered by unbridled corruption.
The past isn’t always a guide to the future, but contemporary history suggests that there is a direct correlation between the failures of the ruling party and the revival of the opposition. At present the BJP seems all-powerful and has spread itself both geographically and socially. Its spectacular growth coupled with its organisational rigour has even led to it being equated with the pre-1967 Congress — a dominant party with the opposition working at the margins. However, nothing is permanent. The future of Indian politics will depend not so much on how the opposition is able to cope with its present disarray but more on how the BJP manages its dominance.
So far, the ruling party has demonstrated stupendous energy and political imagination. The famed political machine that Amit Shah has built is no doubt centred on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal appeal but that appeal in turn has been constructed on the strength of meticulous calculation and the willingness to accept the most daunting of challenges.
The Modi-Shah duo realised — soon after the defeat in the Assembly poll in Bihar in 2015 — that the BJP could not rely only on the vagaries of the first-past-the-post system. It was assumed that the opposition would eventually rally its forces and present a united front. The challenge was, therefore, to build a party capable of securing 50% of the votes. This meant redrawing the party’s social matrix and targeting government policies to realise this objective.
Consequently, the state welfare system focussed single-mindedly on sections that were hitherto outside the BJP ecosystem — particularly individuals who valued caste solidarity and weren’t traditional BJP voters. The outcome of the general election revealed that, riding on the back of welfare schemes, the BJP rallied an incremental constituency of the poor that transcended ties of either caste or political affiliation and voted for Modi, the man who had facilitated a betterment of their personal lives.
Secondly, unlike the first NDA government that took its eye off the BJP’s core constituency to manage coalition pressures and secure greater acceptability, the Modi government was never inclined to shelve the party’s foot soldiers. The sabka saath, sabka vikas approach of the government was complimented by issues that had an emotive appeal to the faithful. These included the constant invocation of national pride, bursts of foreign policy hawkishness, proposed legislation on citizenship and triple talaq, and low tolerance of corruption. These were complemented by symbolic assaults on the Nehruvian consensus and the Khan Market cabal — trivial in the larger scheme of things but issues that excited the bhakt imagination and triggered culture wars.
It is unlikely that this approach will see any shift. Modi will focus on achieving the $5 trillion economy target, securing state efficiency, expanding the architecture of welfare and enhancing India’s global clout. Home minister Amit Shah will pursue more explicitly ideological objectives: crafting a new consensus on citizenship, anti-terrorism and the integration of Kashmir. Seen in totality, the second Modi government will be simultaneously pro-development and pro-nationalist. These approaches will be supplemented by a populist blend of anti-elitism and ethical uprightness.
The opposition to today’s BJP is built on disparate appeals: dynastic loyalty, caste politics, minorityism and cosmopolitan modernity. Their sectional appeals just cannot match Modi’s meta-narrative. Theirs is a crisis of political imagination.

     BJP and Modiji are not new to power! The past five years, if they are not enough for to evaluate them, one can easily pass doubts about your capacity to analyze any political developments. When the PM says, if you get bail from courts, congratulations and enjoy the period. By this statement, even with an increased mandate, what PM is indicating is power had not gone to his head! What the prospective PM said during the elections? "" We will reopen the Rafale and send Modiji to jail"" this even after the supreme court said there is no problem in the deal and they are satisfied. What sort of journalism is adopted by a segment of the media, when you say now, it all dpends on "" how BJP handles power""?...  Read More

Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has fronted the debate on triple talaq, while asking for it not to be politicised. Taslima Nasreen, noted Bangladeshi author living in exile in India for over two decades, spoke to Rohit E David on the issue, if the practice is an essential part of Islam and the position taken by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on it:

AIMPLB has called for a social boycott of those misusing triple talaq, even while terming it an eligible form of divorce. Your comments?
AIMPLB was forced to take this stand in the face of searing criticism from different quarters for not ending a regressive practice like triple talaq. It wants to save its credibility. So, it asks for a social boycott of people divorcing wives through pronouncement of triple talaq in a single sitting. The decision to ask for social boycott is a slap in their face as it proves that the practice is despicable. But still they don’t want to dispense with it, perpetuating misogyny in the name of religion.
If the law board wanted reform of Islam, it could have done so but it has always opposed reforms. This is nothing more than posturing. The truth is that AIMPLB is full of misogynists and it is an anachronism in a modern secular society which pulls the Muslim community backwards.
Why does triple talaq need to be reformed?
It is an unfair thing for Muslim women because women do not have a similar right to divorce their husbands by saying talaq talaq talaq. The problem is not triple talaq: the real problem is women’s financial dependence on men. If women become educated and independent, talaq or divorce won’t scare them. It is hell for dependent women who won’t find any place to stay or any money to survive.
If several Muslim countries have already removed triple talaq, why can’t India?
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey, Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt, Indonesia and Algeria banned triple talaq. Bangladesh banned triple talaq before I was even born. India is not able to do this because of the politics of appeasement. The fear of the minority community can be addressed and they can be assured of their freedom of religion which is guaranteed by Article 25 of the Constitution of India. Mullahs and maulvis have become self-styled representatives of the Muslim community who keep stoking insecurity. Mullahs are stuck in a medieval mindset blocking progress of their own community.
Is triple talaq an essential part of Islam?
Many Muslim countries have abolished it. I do not think any law or system which reduces dignity of human beings should be essential. Even if triple talaq were an inseparable part of Islam, it should still be discarded because women do not have the same right to divorce their husbands.
What is your response to PM Narendra Modi’s comments that all efforts should be made to provide justice to Muslim women?
I appreciate it. I hope Muslim women would get justice not only in India but all over the world.
They have been suffering for too long. They should take off their burqa, hijab and go to school, college, university and live life as they like. Whoever oppresses women should be heavily punished. Women have to liberate themselves. They cannot expect obscurantist mullahs to emancipate them.
What is your view on AIMPLB?
This is an organisation of Sunni fundamentalists which does not take into its fold Shia and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Its duty is to protect Muslim personal laws which are based on Sharia. It supports the antediluvian system of triple talaq, child marriage, and opposes gay rights. It objects to any change in the divorce laws to confer parity to Muslim women. This board issues fatwas against reforms in Islam and all kinds of progressive ideas. The misogynistic law board should be abolished for the sake of Muslims. Muslims need no other laws but modern civil laws based on equality and justice.
There is a demand from right wing groups to disband AIMPLB. Your comments?
It is an irony that the demand of abolishing the board comes from Islamophobes whereas it should have come from Indian left-liberal groups. The hypocrisy of left-liberal groups is unimaginable. Instead of supporting Muslim women’s human rights, they want them to suffer under misogynistic religious laws. The marriage between the left wing and Islamists is one of the world’s biggest tragedies. I oppose the right wing but I am for the abolition of AIMPLB.

     muslim women should decide not to marry a man who has given divorce to his wife without logical reasons. a muslim mother also should not fix marriage of her daughter to such man. so till the law gives its decision muslim women should unite and stand and in this way they can themselves stop other muslim women&#039;s exploitation. a women who marry&#039;s such person should also be ready in future to face the same situation....

Rahul’s acknowledgment of the work done by outgoing BJP chief ministers and Modi’s observation on “victory and defeat as integral part of life” were gracious statements that have become far too rare in today’s polarised and invective-ridden politics.
Congress’s strong return in the Hindi heartland should also compel BJP to come to terms with the deflation of its “Congress mukt Bharat” slogan. While the opposition in Parliament can be raucous and obstructive the idea of eliminating opponents altogether in a democracy has a totalitarian ring. With Congress MPs demanding JPC on Rafale deal, Tamil Nadu MPs demanding protection for Cauvery delta farmers, TDP seeking special status and Shiv Sena a Ram Mandir law, the likelihood of a washout in this session is real unless government shows more intent. General election is approaching and time is running out for 16th Lok Sabha. Passing the triple talaq ordinance is an obvious priority for government, but over 40 other bills are also listed for consideration and passage. However, Centre has shown no urgency in shepherding these through earlier Parliament sessions either.
In contrast to NDA’s current sedentary run, UPA-2’s closing months saw an overdrive as the heavily disrupted 15th Lok Sabha passed a clutch of laws. UPA government was evidently trying to correct public perception that it was corrupt and dysfunctional. Now the NDA government has also landed itself in a spot of bother with the gathering jobs and farm crises. The best way to allay public concern and address the issue head-on would be to ensure a meaningful discussion in Parliament.
While farm loan waivers and MSPs are bandied as a quick fix to allay farmer anger, Centre can show the way to states by going beyond Band-Aid solutions. The time has come to move beyond competitive populism and loosen the stranglehold of middlemen over farmers. Simultaneously, there is an urgent need to grow labour intensive industries to provide more jobs to youth and take more people out of farming. Rather than finger pointing and blame games over these difficulties, Parliament can be the platform to arrive at a political consensus and take corrective action.

Being part of the AIADMK alliance, A C Shanmugam has everything for the asking with the entire state cabinet campaigning and canvassing votes for him. Having won the Vellore Lok Sabha seat in 1984 and placed second in 2014, his is a popular face. But, since he does not belong to the AIADMK and his New Justice Party hardly has a presence, he has a tough battle ahead. Excerpts from an interview with D Govardan:

When election to Vellore LS seat was cancelled, what was your reaction?
Income tax authorities discovered ?11 crore cash from (DMK treasurer) Durai Murugan’s college and premises on April
1. It was proved that cash played a role. After seizing the cash on April 1, they should have cancelled the elections on April 4. But, it was done a day after the campaign ended (on April 16) and it shocked everyone. India was voting to elect the Prime Minister, but the people of Vellore could not participate in that process. Our hard work came to naught. Like Theni, even in Vellore, we would have won by 50,000 to 75,000 votes. My victory was stalled by their cash bags. It jolted me.

Is it any different now?
Now I see that as a welcome development. At least 30 ministers are now camping here to ensure victory of the AIADMK alliance. My only request to them was not to treat this as just an election exercise but help me resolve all issues relating to the constituency. If I had to do this after my win, it would have taken me four years to get these many ministers as well as the chief minister and deputy CM to visit my constituency. Now people have submitted their petitions in person to them and in 15 days the issues of my constituency are known to all ministers. This will help me serve the people better.
You are being projected as a future Union minister if you win.
I am part of the National Democratic Alliance and was with it in 2014 too. During Vajpayee’s NDA too, my party was part of it and I have been a part of the BJP alliance. But my becoming a minister will be decided by the PM and the NDA convenor. My focus is to ensure victory of the two leaves symbol and to serve people. With the AIADMK in power in the state and the BJP at the Centre, I along with my brother and Theni MP P Raveendranath Kumar, can ensure all central schemes reach the state.
Vellore has a large Muslim population and you are alligned with the BJP.
Muslims have accepted the BJP in the north. In Tamil Nadu, due to the opposition’s smear campaign against PM Narendra Modi it became an issue. After becoming PM, Modi has instructed his party MPs to endear themselves to the minorities, so the poisonous campaign by the opposition will not work in Vellore. Recently, a bishop filed his nomination as an independent. But, fearing a split in minority votes, DMK cadres tried to attack him. They attack Muslims and Christians and hence neither of them will vote for Durai Murugan’s family this time. The DMK is in for a big defeat.
Has the BJP has been kept out of the AIADMK campaign?
It is not true. BJP district and state secretaries and functionaries are campaigning with us. The BJP’s flags are prominent on our campaign and rallies. BJP state president Tamilisai Soundarajan too is set to join the campaign.
There are differences within the AIADMK over triple talaq.
A small section of Muslim women welcome the Triple Talaq Bill as a majority of them view the law to be against the Quran. Support and opposition are both from within the community. Hence, my brother Raveendranath Kumar spoke in favour of women’s rights. But, the AIADMK opposed it in Rajya Sabha keeping in mind the majority views and beliefs of the community. They are with us and we will win.

The Hindu right wing, as represented by the BJP and other members of the sangh parivar, have argued in favour of such legislation.  The secular, or liberal, stand has been that the decision to adopt a uniform civil code must come from the minority community itself, so that it did not feel that it was being bullied by the majority.
The waters got muddied in 1985 when the Supreme Court ruled that a 60-year-old Muslim woman, Shah Bano, was eligible to receive maintenance from her husband who had divorced her by involving the Islamic triple talaq custom.
In 1986, the Rajiv Gandhi government of the time, prompted by the adverse reaction to the judgment by the clergy and the Muslim Personal Law Board, reversed the court’s decision by legislating the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act.
To demonstrate its secular credentials, the Congress government was seemingly protecting the rights of minorities to have their own personal laws regarding marriage, divorce and related issues.
But in protecting the rights of a minority community, wasn’t the government trampling on the constitutional rights of a minority within that minority, namely Muslim women?

Muslim law permits polygamy and triple talaq, among other practices that are patently discriminatory against women. In the name of supposed liberalism, should these be allowed to continue?
Now, the Supreme Court has come out strongly on the need to review the issue of Muslim personal law which it says has to “evolve with the times”.  Pointing out that Hindu practices such as sati which violated the fundamental right to life of women have long been scrapped, the court has put the ball in the government’s court to take the necessary legislative action and bring in a uniform civil code which will protect the security and dignity of Muslim women, 90 percent of whom are said to be in favour of such legislation.
Islamic scholar and former chairman of the National Commission of Minorities has come out in favour of legislative safeguards for Muslim women, saying “There is a misconception that Muslim personal law is covered by the right to religious freedom under the Constitution.  Personal laws are within the legislative competence of the state.”
The BJP-led NDA government, however, is unlikely for electoral reasons to be in a hurry to propose such legislation out of apprehension that this would further alienate the Muslim community, which is already wary of it, before the conclusion of the crucial, on-going Bihar polls.
Thanks to the paradox of politics, the secularists and the right-wingers seem to have switched sides.  While a secular-minded SC is in favour of a uniform law for all, the saffron sarkar is trying to appease, or at least not further antagonise, minority sentiments.
As always, gender justice takes a back seat to vote-bank politics.  So what’s new?

     uniform civil code is the need of the time. but it has to be discussed with intellect irrespective of any religion. the problem is that every religion says i am the best while there are space for reform. as far as muslims are concern, they abide quran. marriage in islam is a contract which can be nullify with mutual concern or by either party with some consequences. the problem is in our part of the world that women are suppressed by all religions and the state is also not protecting women by means of providing them necessary shelter and living expenses. contract document be prepared in such a way that it is acceptable to both parties , husband and wife. how to do it, require an open discussion not only from so called religious people but also from others-public....

Shakespeare. Shake what? Shakespeare whose verses and curses do boil and bubble in the cauldron of India. In fact a YouGov poll on the 400th anniversary of his death suggests he’s more loved here than in his homeland. Zounds, he would say, India’s mine oyster.
Modern Brits are handicapped with the bard because they no longer rock that Elizabethan vibe. But we in India – thanks to enduring feudal habits, the caste walls, honour killings, overbearing parents, warring families, khap panchayats and the like – know how a lyrical love story can end in melodramatic puddles of blood for real. Cleopatra, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, they all blend in because forsooth here that whole dying for love or killing for love business is verily a sweet sorrow.
A special shout out also to the witches; we love them three. ‘Fair is foul, foul is fair’, chanted Smriti Irani to accuse the opposition of turning facts on their head in just the past Parliament session. Equally well versed, the opposition chanted back warnings against brewing a hell-broth of riots and rabble.
And the good Prince of Denmark, sooth he’s a role model too. ‘To be or not to be’, we really dig that. Diversely translated as, to GST or not to GST, to GM or not to GM, to deMallya our banks or not, to triple talaq or not … then the native hue of resolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pitch and moment lose the name of action.
All this well-versedness is thanks to India’s English ma’am brigade that zealously drums bardly lessons into school boys and girls, from the ominous ‘I wasted time, and now doth time waste me’ to the lofty ‘To thine own self be true’. Later it’s all a great help at the workplace – there’s daggers in men’s smiles, you’re alerted. And at the love game – asking about his/her favourite author, then showing off your own Shakespearean chops is a foolproof icebreaker on that first date.
Sadly many corners of India still seem deprived of a good English ma’am – like Kolkata. When the English department of a college there hung up a picture of the bard during a freshers’ welcome, all hell broke loose. Trinamool supporters barged in and shouted slogans because they mistook the freshers’ party for a communist conspiracy, and Shakespeare for Lenin!
That must have made the bhadralok blood boil, but at least there’s the relief of cursing lumpens in fine tongue. You scullion! You rampallian! The tautness of your face sours ripe grapes. Thou art as loathsome as a toad.
To be fair to Kolkata, elsewhere in India the bard has been taken for Sheikh Peare and Seshappaiyar and even Sexpior. Measure for Measure, so far he’s been goodly compensation for the Kohinoor.

Make this the beginning of serious military reform","August 16, 2019, 8:07 PM  IST","Manoj Joshi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s problem solving technique hearkens to the method of Alexander of Macedon. Instead of unloosening the intractable Gordian Knot, Alexander hacked it with his sword. Whether it was the tangle on Article 370, triple talaq or black money, Modi has used unorthodox solutions rather than follow the conventional path of persuasion and compromise. This style characterised his Independence Day announcement of appointing a chief of defence staff. The proposal has been doing the rounds for 30 years, but has been skillfully blocked, sometimes by the vested interests of the armed forces themselves, sometimes by pusillanimous politicians and always by the non-expert civilian bureaucracy.
The decision could only have come the way it did: a political pronouncement of a strong and self-confident PM. In his remarks Modi said that the new CDS would provide synergy and effective leadership to the army, navy and air force. This implies that the CDS would be primus inter pares, unless Modi again applies the Alexandrian method and gives him a five-star rank. The government deserves credit for not going down the usual path of appointing yet another commission to deal with the issue. As the PM pointed out, but for minor differences, past recommendations for a CDS were unanimous. Everyone knew what had to be done, but did not have the gumption to do it. In 2012 the Naresh Chandra Task Force saw the CDS as being responsible for a single acquisition plan for all three services, administering tri-service institutions like the strategic forces command or the ones planned for space and cyber operations, leading the forces in out-of-country exigencies, encouraging integrated administration and logistics, in short being the principal military adviser to the government.
The logic of technology as well as the exponential cost of equipment has pushed other militaries to integrate. But the Indian armed forces stood out in splendid isolation as a force stuck in the World War II era. Now, with a CDS, it can be reformed and restructured to make it a force capable of fighting and winning 21st century wars. Having displayed perspicacity here, presumably the government understands that this is the beginning of the process, not its end. Its end point, at least in the first phase, should lead to joint theatre commands and an insistence on uniformed and civilian expertise in the defence ministry chain of command. A situation where the army’s Eastern Command works from Kolkata, the navy’s from Vishakhapatnam and air force’s from Shillong, is an absurdity.
The political leadership needs to keep a sharp eye out for efforts to sabotage the decision. But first, they must avoid a self-goal of handing out the position as a sinecure to some favoured general for services rendered. The CDS’s task on hand will be enormous and requires great intellectual and executive skills to make up for lost time. Equally, the government must show how serious it is by formally amending its archaic, but crucial, internal business allocation and transaction rules. These lay out the executive responsibilities and powers of officials and, in their current iteration, ignore the role of uniformed personnel. Unless the CDS is inserted into these rules, things will not change.
The wars of today no longer involve just the military. They often present a bewildering overlap of conventional warfare, terrorism, legal and psychological instruments and the use of information through conventional and social media. This requires better coordination not just among the three services, but between the military, civilians and political leadership. Actually, when it comes to rules of business, it may be a good idea to include the national security adviser as well. In April 2018, the government had set up a defence planning committee under the NSA and authorised him to deal with a range of issues relating to defence at the apex level. With the appointment of the CDS this higher command system “with Indian characteristics” requires some urgent clarification.

     The creation of this new post - if India has got along without it for thirty years, intuition suggests it will not set the Ganges on fire - should not get bogged down in protocol and warrant of precedence. One veteran has said the forces need a five star boss, not a token four star who will be ignored by them. It is an advisory staff post, not a super genersl or admiral exercising day to day executive authority. Ego and personality issues should be thoughtfully kept at bay. 2. In the normal course, Raksha Mantri should be able to sit regularly with the three chiefs and ensure optimum coordination. There is also a very powerful, effective NSA who plays a supervisory, harmonising role. Expectations from the new arrangement should be modest to begin with....

This means in the Parliament session beginning Monday, NDA will once again try to pass this legislation, which earlier the opposition had blocked in the Rajya Sabha. Whether NDA now has the numbers there to finally get its way is one matter. Perhaps the broader matter is what this says about the minority outreach that has been signaled by Modi 2.0.

It’s been nearly two years since the Supreme Court took away the legal status of triple talaq, a practice that is outlawed in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries. Opponents of earlier versions of the bill have asked, what would Parliament achieve by criminalizing what is already illegal? It has been passionately argued that this criminalization will not only intimidate Muslim men but also cause hardship for Muslim women.
At the very start of his second innings as Prime Minister Narendra Modi fore-fronted the task of earning the trust of minorities. Alongside he has fore-fronted the slogan ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. The promise of a focus on education and health, has already been backed by the announcement of scholarships for five crore students from minority communities over five years, with 50% reserved for girls. But now the triple talaq bill has been put back on the table. And the talking heads of the community are once again passionately split on the government’s intentions. This is a reminder, if any was needed, that minority outreach of Modi 2.0 will be a bumpy journey.

Every election, be it at a panchayat election, a municipal election, a state election or a Lok Sabha by-election, the press makes this into an analysis of how the country will vote in the Lok Sabha elections. Every loss of the BJP is interpreted and talked about as a potential rout for the ruling party.
Were expectations of the electorate taken to such a high level in the 2014 elections that no achievement, however big or small, seems to satisfy some of the voters any longer? Or is it simply a group of politicians and journalists with high decibel vocal cords who have still not understood or accepted that the nation gave a clear mandate to the BJP in 2014 who elected Mr Modi as their leader?
Politicians and bureaucrats, who believe in their “entitlement” have not been able to accept the unconventional steps being taken by the Prime Minister in virtually every sphere. What galls them even more that he and his ministers are getting results. This Government does not believe in “this is how it was always done in the past”, though opposition politicians keep harping on the old ways. Corrupt politicians have been jailed while inefficient bureaucrats have been transferred or sent into retirement. The work ethic is coming back into Government offices and the common person is beginning to get their work done – something that was theirs by right and not as a favour.
The Prime Minister has changed the paradigm.
There is no holy grail any longer.
The opposition has not been able to find a single case of corruption in this Government and therefore they have no choice but to find a response to every decision taken. After all, they too have to survive and hopefully, thrive, in some future election.
It is easy to blame the Prime Minister for everything. From the price of onions to potholes in the roads, from relations with neighbouring countries to law and order in every city and from pollution in the capital to the response to Padmaavat and not reigning in the Kaarni Sena. Everyone blames the Prime Minister and expects him to answer for everything.
Instead of accepting the huge strides India has made in the past four years, we are busy castigating the leader and the party.
Even if the Congress leadership grudgingly wish to accept the accomplishments of the Modi Government, they have a “Yes But” answer to everything.
Let us look at some of these significant achievements and direction setting that has been done by this Government over the past few years as well as the completely irrelevant responses of our “Yes But” brigade. Results of some of these actions will be seen over the next few years.

Triple Talaq is one of the most far-reaching legislations for the Muslim community affecting women. Millions of women who were at the mercy of their husbands have been given relief. Barring some interested men from the community, almost everyone has welcomed this. Yes But, says the opposition without acknowledging the significant role played by the Government in getting this implemented, what about Love Jihad?
Ease of Doing Business rating by the World Economic Forum showed that India has climbed from 142nd rank to 100th rank in the World. The country has received record foreign investments and foreign reserves are at an all-time high. Yes But, say our opposition leaders, the fringe is creating havoc and frightening away the investors.
GST, possibly one of the most dramatic financial legislation undertaken in India since independence, has unified the country into a single tax zone. This has been lauded all over the world except by our opposition politicians and some businesspersons who have been used to concealing income to evade taxes. Everyone talks about the loss to the small businessperson but no one talks about the millions of truck drivers who have gained a more than 30% time advantage because they do not have to waste time waiting at state borders. Even the upgrade by Moody’s after the implementation of GST has refused to get any plaudits or a grudging acknowledgement from the Congress despite the fact that the rating upgrade is for the nation and not for the ruling party or the Prime Minister. Yes But, the implementation of the “Gabbar Singh Tax” has been poor says Rahul Gandhi not knowing what else to say to criticise which he must!
Surgical Strike launched by the Indian Army against Pakistan was a courageous and morale boosting decision that was taken. Never would have the Indian Army imagined that they too could become the subject of questions and in future needed to carry cameras into the battlefield to prove their claims. Yes But, “show us evidence of the surgical strike” say the opposition politicians trying to cause uncertainty among the people. They are out only to score a political point.
Swachh Bharat is an initiative, a national movement, the Mr Modi announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort in his first speech and he was mocked by many in the opposition for raising this at an Independence Day speech. Today, there is a marked improvement in the consciousness of the people on cleanliness. Yes But, I see trash in my locality is the standard comment of every opposition politician! They take exceptional pride in being able to take photographs of trash and posting it on social media.
Bank accounts for all were promised and implemented with zero balance for every citizen of the country. Such financial inclusion has not been experienced in seven decades post independence. Yes But, where is the Rs 15 lakhs promised to everyone during the election rallies, say the naysayers, refusing to accept the success of the Jan Dhan scheme?
Demonetisation came as a surprise to everyone. This was one of the harshest action taken against black money circulating in the economy. This move also wiped out the large quantum of fake notes that were being pushed into our economy from our Western neighbour. All political parties cried foul and businesspersons complained incessantly. Those sitting with large hoards of cash were hurt, not the common person. Yes But, look at the challenges faced by the common person and look at Gujarat election results, which gave a fitting response against the demonetisation.
Make in India as an initiative cannot be questioned by anyone given its simplicity and intent. All that the Prime Minister has been asking for is to manufacture in India thus creating economic activity and jobs. In the process, he is inviting foreign investors to set up manufacturing facilities in India. Yes But, what about the beef ban say our naysayers who cannot find anything else to question or criticise. When nothing else work, they criticise the metallic lion symbol of Make in India.
GDP Growth hit a decade low of 5% in 2012/13, to 7.9% in 2015/16 and faced a drop subsequently due to the temporary impact of demonetisation. India is seen as the fastest growing economy for the near future and with more fundamental corrections being made to the economy, growth will become more robust. Yes But, says the former Finance Minister, what about saffronisation of the country?
International Diplomacy of the Prime Minister has made India into a highly talked about subject in virtually every boardroom in the World. Our reforms and the political stability makes India a very attractive destination for potential investors. We can see the results with the records investments pouring into the country. Yes But, says the opposition who have no way to counter this, “The Prime Minister travels too much and has become non resident”.


Aadhar Card, started by the UPA Government has been taken forward by leaps and bounds by the NDA Government. It is the poorer people of society who will benefit from the direct benefit transfer and all other associated reliefs. Linking bank accounts to Income Tax returns, gas cylinders, driving licences, passports, investments etc will make our nation more transparent and inclusive. Yes But Aadhar is an invasion of my privacy and violates my fundamental rights say people who do not want transparency because what they have will now be visible to all.

The diversionary tactics of opposition members by questioning every move of this government are clear. They want to somehow create havoc with their comments and create some doubt in the minds of the electorate.
John F Kennedy famously remarked in his inauguration speech – “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country”.
This is the time for each one of us to internalise these words carefully and make it a part of our own mindset. If we want to see India occupy its logical place in the comity of nations, we need to think of what we can do for our country.

During a recent visit to India, former US President Barack Obama spoke of the importance of the individual citizen in the dynamics of democracy.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-91988"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/speaking-tree-bccl-2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/speaking-tree-bccl-2-1.jpg 640w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/speaking-tree-bccl-2-1-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
By far, the most crucial office in a democracy is that of the so-called aam aadmi, the common citizen. It is the duty of individual citizens to judge and respond to the policies and decisions made on their behalf by their political leaders.
Governmental policies and actions are nothing more, or less, than the reflected will of the people, of individual citizens forming a consensus. As such, prime ministers and presidents are – or ought to be – mirrors reflecting the will of those who have elected them to office.
Obama was talking about political democracy. But his words could apply equally to what might be called spiritual democracy. Despite the routine and repeated pronouncements that India is a secular nation, and that there is a separation between the state and religion, in fact, religious faith and politics are inextricably intertwined.
This is more true today than ever before, when the nation is increasingly divided along religious lines, and politicians on both sides exploit the growing rift between the majority and minority communities.
This is where the dynamics of spiritual democracy come in, to counter the cynical politics of sectarianism and communalism played for the sake of winning votes.
What are the dynamics of spiritual democracy? Essentially the same as the dynamics of political democracy as outlined by Obama. In political democracy, it is the right, and the responsibility, of individual citizens to examine and, if necessary, question the policies and actions of their elected leaders.
Similarly, spiritual democracy requires that individual members of any particular faith examine, through the prism of their conscience, the teachings of their religious leaders, which could be shaped to further a political agenda. Spiritual democracy entails the examination of any specific precept to see if it is a central tenet to the faith concerned. Two topical examples could be the demolition of the Babri masjid and the demand for the building of a Ram temple on the disputed site, and the practice of triple talaq.
Is the construction of a temple to Ram exactly where the mosque stood central to that over-reaching body of philosophical thought and spiritual belief to which has been given the portmanteau tag of Hinduism, or is it a core issue only for the political agenda of Hindutva, which is an entirely different matter?
Similarly, is triple talaq an integral and essential part of Islam, or can it, for the sake of social equity, be dispensed with without loss of either face or faith?
These are only two politically-charged issues concerning religion in which the dynamics of spiritual democracy have an important part to play. Political democracy affirms the active participation of citizens, and the citizens’ right to question governmental policies they disagree with.
Spiritual democracy is an affirmation of the believers’ right to question the relevance of quasi-religious dogmas of their communities. In order to be a true Hindu, must i endorse the mandir?  In order to be a true Muslim, must i endorse triple talaq?
These and similar questions make for not just a public political debate; they can make for a transformative inner and individual spiritual debate.

The claim that this is a religious practice protected under Article 25 of the Constitution, recalls earlier claims that child marriage and triple talaq have the sanction of tradition and religion. The trampling of individual rights in the 21st century cannot be accepted on the grounds that it was acceptable to our ancestors.
On Monday the SC bench sharply asked, “Why should anyone have the power based on religious practices to touch the genital of a girl?”
Testimony of survivors as well as documentation of the conditions under which this mutilation takes place, has built up convincing evidence of how it leaves them physically, psychologically and sexually scarred for life. At an age when they are too young to know the enduring consequences of what is being done to their bodies, little girls must not be cut up in the name of religion.

Not so the maximalism on interfaith marriages","January 8, 2021, 7:27 AM  IST","TOI Edit","Centre’s submission to Supreme Court to defer the legal challenge against its farm laws makes eminent sense in the context of ongoing negotiations between government and farm unions. Commencing hearings would force Centre to file affidavits stating its position, which could become a hindrance in the current fluid situation where talks hint at compromises on both sides. SC rightly welcomed the possibility of dialogue resolving the agitation, which is essentially a political deadlock rather than there being justiciable issues at stake.
However, the court’s initial reluctance to entertain challenges to the near identical interfaith marriage and religious conversion laws enacted by Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and likely to be replicated by Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka and Haryana is difficult to understand. So many states piloting legislation undermining the right of consenting adults to marry is alarming. Infantilising them as potential victims of an unfounded religious conversion bogey derisively termed love jihad, which has no substantive basis, not only undermines individual liberty but is also divisive. SC must step in and expeditiously underline the constitutional position on individual liberties.
Apart from constitutional doctrine is the harsh lived reality of immense turmoil the laws have already caused, especially in UP. Ideally, the victims – arrested Muslim men and interfaith couples whose lives were interrupted by police action – will implead themselves into the case. Recall that SC’s verdict outlawing instant triple talaq gained moral force and urgency with a few brave, aggrieved Muslim women coming forward to fight the legal battle. The current situation puts the lower judiciary in a difficult, if not absurd, situation. Lower courts are constrained by the presence of these draconian laws on the statute book to remand those arrested by police to custody. This contradicts their remit to protect individual liberties. SC must repair this rift between law and justice.

     Farm laws and law on interfaith marriages proposed by Certain BJP ruled states are different from each other.The law is only to protect the Hindu majority from forceable conversion to other relegion through coercive methods.Right to marriage with mutual consent is protected on law and in modern times we witness plenty of intercaste and relegion marriages ....

Also remember, it’s a segment of Muslim women like Shayara Bano, themselves, who have pushed the petition through right up to the Supreme Court and not the government.” 
“The judgement as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Shayara Bano case last year was examined against the backdrop of the Quran, Islamic practices and the treatment of Talaq-e-Biddat popularly known as Instant Triple Talaq in Islamic nations across the world. The act was found to be unQuranic and unIslamic and hence the judgement criminalizing the act and directions made to the Government to enact a formal law criminalising Instant Triple Talaq. This is what has led to the formation of the Bill,” I explained.
It seems like poetic justice. What started off as a slur with the Shah Bano issue has been finally resolved with the Shayara Bano judgement. The Indian Supreme Court’s lofty history is scarred with the shameful reversal of the historic judgement in Shah Bano’s case passed in favour of the Muslim divorcee seeking alimony, by the-then Congress government who – by dint of absolute majority – enacted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in the Parliament back in 1986. The move strained the already-tense relations between the Judiciary and the Legislature even further.
Thirty-two years later, the present-day government, after passing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights in Marriage) Act in the Lok Sabha and reaching a roadblock in Rajya Sabha owing to a belligerent Opposition, resorted to the Ordinance route to implement the new legislation on Instant Triple Talaq. It has demonstrated phenomenal legislative resolve and, in a clean sweep, restored the Judiciary’s faith in legislative processes.
Back in history, following the Shah Bano judgement, Muslim politicians had mounted a vitriolic campaign for the verdict’s nullification. Under pressure from Islamic orthodoxy and panicky in an election year, the Congress government gave into the pressure and reversed the judgement by introducing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act and enforced a highly controversial legislation that restricted the right to maintenance to the period of iddat after the divorce and shifted the onus of maintaining the Muslim woman on ‘her’ relatives or the Wakf Board. The move was perceived across the world as being discriminatory as it denied right to basic maintenance available to non-Muslim women under common law.
Today, the pressures faced by the BJP government are as bad if not worse. For the Supreme Court to even consider judging the issue of Instant Triple Talaq in the case of Shayara Bano instead of simply dismissing it as an issue in the domain of the Legislature, was a huge step in the direction of resolving relations between the Legislature and the Judiciary. Post Shah Bano, the Supreme Court would be fully justified in reserving its judgement on Shayara Bano’s Instant Triple Talaq issue and instead throwing the contentious ball back to the Legislature historically known to pander to populist sentiments. But, the Supreme Court didn’t do so. And, instead, ruled on the Instant Triple Talaq with judicious alacrity synonymous with the nation’s highest court. 
It examined whether the practice of Talaq-E-Biddat (Instant Triple Talaq) was ‘Islamic’ by analysing the views of religious scholars on the issue; checked its validity and reach in South Asia, Islamic countries and legality across the world. And, in a 395-page judgement complete with overwhelming analysis of religious verse and sentiment, passed its order criminalising the act. The Supreme Court went on to ask the Legislature to enact a law to criminalise the practice of ‘Instant Triple Talaq’.
The move was progressive, women-centric and great in law. But then, it wasn’t populist as most good judgements. Reportedly, some Muslim men in Uttar Pradesh have committed Instant Triple Talaq even after the Supreme Court declared it illegal. Till a law on it is passed, the acts of Instant Triple Talaq can be tried as Contempt of Court. But, what is of pivotal importance is the present-day government’s truthful resolve in reaching justice to a section of women while fending off attacks by fundamentalist, orthodox segments and politically motivated sections within the community and beyond.


The present-day Bill lays down a provision for the aggrieved wife to seek subsistence allowance and custody of her minor children by moving court. According to the Bill, Instant Triple Talaq, proclaimed verbally, through writing or electronic form through Whatsapp, messages or otherwise, would be illegal and void. Instant Triple Talaq would be proclaimed a cognisable and a non-bailable offence and any aggrieved Muslim woman would be entitled to approach a magistrate court to seek redress. 
After seeking the opinion of all State governments on the issue and procuring the support of a majority for the new legislation drafted by the Centre, the Bill was stuck in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) due to a deadlock over the Opposition’s demand seeking its reference to a Select Committee for a ‘close scrutiny’ despite it (the Bill) being cleared by the Lok Sabha. 
Left with no option, the Government has decided to move an Ordinance to make the progressive Legislation a reality and swiftly too. And, while the Ordinance route, in theory, seems a wee high-handed, in practice particularly in such a situation provides legal respite. In a sharp contrast of sorts, the very Opposition that has been charging the BJP government with trying to usurp the powers of the Judiciary (CJI issue) through undemocratic means has been stalling the progress of the Instant Triple Talaq Bill initiated by none other than the Supreme Court itself.
The present-day Legislature is paying back the Judiciary in its own coin by making a Law as laid down in the Shayara Bano case. And now, in the face of such overwhelming opposition, an Ordinance is the only way left for the government to keep the faith. 
“Instant Triple Talaq should and will go as ordained,” I told the student. “It’s about human rights and particularly so, the rights of the very women we talk endlessly of respecting, saving and protecting, right?” She acquiesced!

"1616953602-190","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=triple+talaq","Let Truth Must Not Prevail!","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/abhiram/let-truth-must-not-prevail/","Let Truth Must Not Prevail!","February 22, 2020, 7:53 PM  IST","Sudhanshu Tripathi","Today, all saner voices must come forward to unite and collectively fight the obnoxious and vicious forces working against Bharat when the very spirit of the truth is being blatantly crushed by the anti-national elements having perfect collusion with Pakistan.
As a common saying goes like this that you just speak a lie hundred times and manage to get it reiterated by few others, your lie will in itself become a truth to be solemnly endorsed by many others. Because nobody has time to investigate the truth nor has the interest to take pains to peep into the actual reasons. As a consequence liars and rumour mongers find it easy to have a field day to propagate their cooked up truths among people at large. As may be easily observed from the continuing protests by the Bharatiya Muslims over CAA and not yet clearly emerged NRC at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi and elsewhere in the country that how the cooked up truths continue to prevail over the actual position of CAA as well explained by the PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah many times over. In fact, this is a meticulously planned strategy of the pseudo-nationalist leaders or the separatists in the Muslim community who at the instigation of Pakistan are hell-bent to create unruly chaos in Bharat, which may cause a permanent communal divide and that may ultimately lead to civil war therein, so as to disintegrate the country once again on grounds of Two nation theory, as happened in 1947. This can be clearly seen by the ongoing vociferous and aggressive reactions over the CAA and NRC by the misguided and misled Muslims and with few others who have been made to remain too much confused and afraid to become pawns in the hands of these leaders, who wish to throw them away into the social and communal turbulence in all over the country, and are deliberately using them as tools to create utter lawlessness and anarchy to malign the peaceful and law-abiding image of the country in the world. Indeed, the CAA and NRC have become a safe bet in the hands of these so-called leaders to continue their nefarious and divisive power-politics in collusion with Pakistan to browbeat the national leadership to withdraw the CAA and foreclose any likelihood of NRC in future. In fact, these leaders are worried over their consolidated vote-bank which may decrease due to the provisions of the CAA, which provides for granting of Bharatiya citizenship to all those victimised minorities, consisting of Hindus, Shikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who have migrated from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh as all these are Islamic countries, to seek refuge in Bharat prior to or on 31 st December 2014.
This is why, Pakistan Zindabad slogan is being raised by the ignorant and confused youths in the public rallies of such leaders who threaten and terrorise to the county’s majority community and also the popularly elected national government and also the governments in the states that they will forcibly snatch their azadi by all means possible, come what may be. Obviously they are playing in tune with the hidden agenda of Pakistan which has long been carrying out its covert efforts to interfere into the internal issues of Bharat with a view to regain its lost honour anyhow that it had repeatedly lost at the hands of Bharat’s valiant soldiers in the past. This is why Islamabad, which is unable to swallow the stigma of its decisive defeat in the past four wars with New Delhi, has taken sole reliance on mischiefs and various other covert means, particularly upon the non-state actors to seek its pending avenge against Bharat. Evidently it continues with its secret agenda to retaliate anyhow and for that it exports cross-border terrorism into Bharat as it cannot win an open war with its bête-noire. And to this end it has penetrated deep into the Bhartiya Muslim community by inciting them to resort to jihad or global jihad on religious grounds as Islam is in danger and also to create a pan-Islamic union of faithful devotees called Ummah which excludes all others as kafirs. In fact, the terrorists in Pakistan are very much radicalized and this pernicious trend is gradually affecting the Bhartiya Muslims who are indeed being misguided by these pseudo-nationalists at the behest of Pakistani leaders including orthodox Mullahs, its Army and secret agency ISI, all having close nexus with numerous terror-outfits including global terror-networks.
All in all, the entire Pakistani establishment is bitterly embarrassed at the consecutive success that the NDA led BJP government at the centre has accomplished in a very short time frame over some of the most vexatious and long-pending issues viz. abrogation of Triple Talaq, Art 370, and Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Maszid dispute. Though Islamabad tried to internationalise these issues at almost all global forums against New Delhi in the recent past months but failed every time due to Bharat’s clear message and strong diplomacy highlighting the urgent redress of these long pending issues as their pendency was causing potential threats to the unity and integrity of the country. Fortunately that was largely accepted by the whole world in Bharat’s favour. In fact, all these issues, inter-alia Common civil code, Population control etc., were the salient features of the BJP’s election manifesto over which it secured decisive mandate twice in 2014 and again in 2019. Added to these achievements is the continuing and consistent ascendance of Bharat at the global centre-stage which has accrued a distinct and respectful status to the country and its leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite occasional reference of
New Delhi as an intolerant India or rising fascist Hinduism by the western leaders and their media as well. As a matter of fact, the West led by the USA has its own compulsions while dealing with both Bharat and Pakistan in South Asia. The USA never goes in strong favour of New Delhi because it wishes to maintain the existing balance of power in South Asia so that it may derive maximum mileage from these two neighbouring countries in its favour due to different reasons like ongoing global war against terrorism and countering China’s rising ascendance in the East and also because both Pakistan and Bharat are now nuclear powers.
In such a grim scenario, when the very spirit of truth has been crushed by these anti-national elements in perfect collusion with Pakistan, all saner voices must come forward to unite and collectively fight such obnoxious and vicious forces deriving their roots from Pakistan by taking recourse to eternal and universal moral values with which ancient Bharat has always been eulogized and recognized as a spiritual guru and the so-evolved rich cultural heritage still manifesting into ethical values like truth, peace, love, non-violence, non-conceit, justice, non-alignment etc., ensuring common interests of the humanity in all over the world. This is possible as nothing is beyond human endeavour.

She was talking about colonisers justifying their rule by “saving” Hindu women from their men, abolishing backward native practices like sati.
The British have left, but that impulse is alive and thriving. Many of us are never so righteously indignant as when saving Muslim women from Muslim men. When the object of concern is a Kashmiri Muslim girl, this “saviour-complex” only shines bigger and brighter, with a frisson of nationalist pride.
Here is what happened: Zaira Wasim, the 16-year-old actor who played the wrestler Geeta Phogat in Dangal, was viciously trolled by Kashmiri separatists and Islamists, after her chief minister held her up as a better role model than separatists like Burhan Wani. Wasim first posted an apology that sounded crushed and submissive, and then another statement asking for the whole issue to be dropped. Her tone could not have sounded more unlike that of the world-beating Geeta Phogat in Dangal.

But throughout this flap, it is telling that we’ve heard less from Wasim herself than from the entire Hindu right-wing establishment, from ministers to media to Twitter warriors, who proclaimed themselves horrified at what Wasim was subjected to. They taunted liberals for their “silence”. Many liberals and progressives, Hindus, Muslims and others, also spoke up for her, but were barely heard above the din.
To state the obvious: the bullying of a teenager, the attack on her freedom, is despicable. If the Islamists attacked her for acting in a Bollywood movie, for the Hindu right-wing and post-faith liberals, Zaira Wasim is just an occasion for rhetoric, another symbol of the “oppressed Muslim woman”, dragged back by her cruel and medieval culture. Our debates about uniform civil code or triple talaq traffic in the same old tropes about docile, vulnerable women.
Here’s the only question to care about: when someone champions the cause of a Muslim woman like Zaira Wasim or Shayara Bano, are they coming from a place of true solidarity, or obliviousness, or active Islamophobia? Is the woman a mute symbol, or is she credited with being a full, complex person and equal citizen, with her own agency and constraints and desires, different as they may be from someone else’s?
Many of us, whether we are liberals or Hindutva sympathisers, borrow Western Orientalist ideas about Muslim women as uniquely oppressed and caged. Instead of asking them, listening to them, amplifying their voices if necessary, we speak for them and over them. Some of us decide that their religion and culture are the problem – even though our own domestic and social environments aren’t enabling women either.
For instance, is it not incredible that everyone demands a uniform civil code for the sake of Muslim women, when no Muslim women’s organisation seems to want this? If you were a sincere ally, you wouldn’t want to flay their religion off their backs — because it remains, for many people, a big part of their self, culture, and community. If you truly cared, you would make a bigger fuss about their material insecurity — the layered disadvantages of being female, a member of a religious minority, and overwhelmingly poor. You would stand alongside, not pity from a great height.
Women’s rights have also been the cover for many predations, like the invasion of Afghanistan, and global gender justice campaigns often look like Western moral crusades, writes the anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod in her essay ‘Do Muslim Women Need Saving?’ which surveys the diverse lives and motivations of Muslim women.
But there’s no stopping the pity-party, and it’s open to all kinds of Islam-baiters. Even Donald Trump claimed to feel deeply sorry for Ghazala Khan, the mother of the slain army captain Humayun Khan, whom he insulted. “She was not allowed to speak”, he claimed, when she was silent in her grief. In response, Muslim women flooded the internet with the hashtag #CanYouHearUsNow. One said, “as a politics professor, I lecture to many silent men, because I’m the expert in the room”. Another informed Trump of their “work to make the country free of sexual violence. How’s that beauty pageant going?”
There’s a whole continuum, from Ayaan Hirsi Ali to Sex and the City 2, to slave pornography to pulpy books about forced marriages, that make Western audiences demonise Muslim men and feel for Muslim women. But in India, the rest of us can’t affect distance from “honour culture”; women’s autonomy and freedom are curtailed by all our different cultures. Kashmir may be no country for feminist rock bands, but surely that’s also because human rights, the liberal promise of free and fulfilling lives, seems like a fiction there. Meanwhile, in our own comfortable contexts, Indian liberals also struggle with gendered social roles. Let’s liberate ourselves before rushing to “uplift” others we haven’t taken the trouble to know.
If we genuinely care about Muslim women, we would applaud and support them as they wrest their rights. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which fought to abolish triple talaq and codify family law further, doesn’t need rescuing and doesn’t try to be less Muslim to be more Indian. They want their due as citizens, and they assert their definitions of Islamic law. This is not to say that they can only be heard within the confines of their religion — but that the choice is theirs alone.
But as the storm over Wasim shows, nothing comes as easy as clucking over and patronising Muslim women. It also makes for instant popularity. “You’re my role model,” Aamir Khan told young Zaira, backing her in this time of trouble. Khan, who’s pretty much the incarnation of the saviour complex in many of his artistic choices, Dangal included, has made a movie starring Zaira Wasim. Called ‘Secret Superstar’, it seems to be about an adorable veiled girl who defies her music-hating Muslim fundoo father and becomes a YouTube sensation. Now there’s a movie guaranteed to please every crowd.

     muslims do not believe in plurality of thoughts or in democratic principles, relying instead on a theocratic, monolithic version of their medieval belief system.islamic fundamentalism is not a negligible problem. if one wants to address this problem, one has to go to its very roots. preaching principles of freedom of expression alone won&rsquo;t do any good. one has to know what mantra makes terrorists tick and influences them to take up arms. it is important to stop indoctrination of children with irrational religious faith at home or institutions like madrassas or mosques. they should be raised to have logical, rational minds and to adopt scientific outlooks that are able to distinguish between right and wrong. i strongly believe that as long as islam remains unreformed, there can be no end to terror. your article is nothing but blame everyone else but pisslam...

In literacy levels and school attendance at upper primary, secondary and higher secondary levels, Muslims fare worse than other weaker groups like Dalits and Adivasis or just as bad. 17% of Muslims between ages 3 and 35 had never enrolled in a formal education programme compared to 13.4% of Dalits and 14.7% Adivasis.
The findings are a pointer to the social and economic backwardness of the Muslim community. The appeasement politics that BJP accused Congress and other secular parties of practising had run its course by 2014. Instead of continuing to raise old slogans, it is time to launch new schemes. A community falling behind doesn’t behove well for India’s development or growth trajectory. Educational avenues have helped India overcome the history of caste inequities and is helping hitherto backward communities join the mainstream. The falling fertility rates are also being ascribed to improved education prospects of girl children and delaying of marriage age.

A paradigm shift has to be made by central and state governments to address the educational slide in the Muslim community. To make matters worse ill-conceived policies like NRC and CAA have increased the trust deficit between the community and government. The criminalisation of triple talaq was presented as a welfare measure for Muslim women; an education outreach can benefit the entire Muslim community. The rollout of the new National Education Policy is a timely moment to focus on early learning, especially among the weakest sections of society.

     No need to show any sympathy on Muslim community. They never willing to educate properly.  They always remained and remain in stone age. If any educated Muslim raise any objection on prevailing system the entire community blast that person. Let muslims stay in hell....  Read More

We can be sure that its implications will unfold in many ways in the years and decades to come – likely empowering not just Muslim women, in fact not just women but also other subjects of discrimination, in their struggle for equality.
While there has long been mainstream consensus that triple talaq brutalizes women, it survived so far in the name of religion. In this it is only one of many practices like nikah halala, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, unequal guardianship rights, and unequal access to places of worship – where women continue to be subjected to discrimination in the name of religion and tradition. In this sense today’s victory is not the end of the fight but just the beginning.

For a brutalized woman the fight can seem daunting, the rewards uncertain, the journey uphill and sometimes backbreaking. The question she asks herself is, what difference can I make? But what a difference Shayara Bano has made. She was the first petitioner in the case that made history today. Fifteen years of marriage came to an abrupt end for her when in 2015 she was served a talaqnama via Speed Post. To underline, her husband ended the marriage unilaterally and instantaneously, with a letter in which talaq was written thrice. Unlike the millions of other women who have suffered similar injustice in silence, she went to court.
Petitioners Aafreen Rehman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri joined her. Lawyers like Indira Jaising and collectives like Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board stood like rock next to her. From all over India support poured in from Muslim and Hindu women alike. A solidarity grew where a woman had been abandoned, alone and browbeaten.
Shayara Bano calls pushing triple talaq into history’s dustbin “a milestone on the road to reforms”. It’s a pretty distinguished milestone. It guarantees her a place in tomorrow’s textbooks. She has emerged as a hero of modern India. Her story should now be told to all the daughters of India, to make them stronger and aware of their rights and ready to stand up for them.
As the Attorney General submitted to Supreme Court, “Gender justice [is] a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same half of the country’s citizenry would not be able to enjoy to the fullest – their rights, status and opportunities.”
Politicians are trying to hijack today’s victory. But it belongs to the women of India and to everyone who values the fundamental right to equality.

The Bharatiya Janata Party turned 40 this week on April 6. Founded in 1980 with Atal Behari Vajpayee as its first President, it has been a striking journey for the party from a mere 2 seats in Lok Sabha in 1984 to 303 seats in last year’s general elections, and its second consecutive victory. The BJP has moved in a short span of time from the politico-electoral margins to becoming India’s “political mainstream” as characterised by Damle and Andersen. This current politico-electoral dominance of the BJP has been keenly debated by pundits globally with some calling it the rise of the “BJP system” akin to the “Congress system,” and some calling it a juggernaut or renaissance. Suhas Palshikar attempted to explain BJP’s rise in India’s politics as “crafting of a hegemony.”
The BJP has earned this current political sweet spot on account of many reasons. Here, again, Vajpayee laid out the political roadmap in his Presidential Address to its 1st national executive meeting in Bombay in 1980 wherein he called on the party to follow a three-pronged programme- of sanghathan (organisation), sangharsh (struggle) and sanrachna (constructive construction). However, it received game-changing booster shots in three instances: the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and Advani-led Rath Yatra in 1989-90, the 1st Vajpayee-led NDA government from 1998-2004 and, most dramatically, the “Modi regime” since 2014.
In what can now be described as the BJP playbook, the party has successfully managed to achieve what looked politically impossible just a few years ago: an ideological and electoral hegemony of sorts. Even its foremost critics will concede that BJP has overturned large swathes of India into its own ideological image, viz., Hindu nationalism and “new developmentalism.” This explains why the dramatic abrogation of Article 370, the banning of triple talaq law and the Ram Temple verdict went unchallenged. Electorally, the BJP juggernaut is on a roll. Moving out of its traditional strongholds, and reclaiming them, in the Hindi heartland, the party, in recent years, has made strong inroads into North and Eastern parts of India. This electoral surge has been powered by the RSS which commands the full loyalty of its own cadres.
The BJP has also been driven by its top leadership, with Modi leading from the front. He has been the most popular face of the party as the PM, joined now by the most ideological and strategic mind any political party would dream of in Amit Shah, the modern day Chanakya. Unlike the not-so-hidden Vajpayee-Advani schisms, there is a clear political camaraderie between the two.
The BJP continues to hold on to the reins of power, equally and significantly, also due to the dismal state of the opposition, but principally the state of the Congress party. Here, the party has essentially set the terms of the ideological fight and the opposition is meekly on the defensive and emulating diffidently the political beliefs of the BJP. The BJP also by its stint of power since 2014 and more eager and willing to commit its organizational and financial reserves makes the best of any electoral battle too by out-spending and out-manning the opposition parties.
Though the BJP war-room hopes that its “hegemonic” state will endure for a long time to come, the party is already coping with the twin challenges of power and promise. The party is now facing the perils of being in office since 2014 of power itself and the promise of power it has kindled in its leadership, organization and most importantly, the masses.
Though the Modi-Shah continue to do the heavy lifting politically and electorally, there are inherent limitations to what both can singularly achieve for the party. Unless the party infuses new, inclusive, credible and popular faces into its decision-making structures with accountability, especially at the state levels where its footprint is increasingly and successfully challenged, the party will be under pressure to deliver the impossible. This has been flagged again in the recent Delhi elections, and the Maharashtra government formation fiasco. The BJP redeemed its image by its success in regaining power in MP though. But, it also sent out a message that the BJP, the party with a difference, was power-hungry. Secondly, though the top duo continues to deliver on the political-ideological front, the RSS has been uncomfortable with the cult of the personality and strives to a build a collective leadership in the party. Many have thus contrasted the BJP 1.0 under Vajpayee-Advani with BJP 2.0 under Modi-Shah. On various occasions now, but similarly in the past too, the RSS leadership detests the “Congress culture” seeping into the BJP fold that includes an unhindered lust for power aided also by the high profile lateral entrants from the Congress. Many insiders also rue the new task and target oriented rather than organic activities dictated by the “high command” and the excessive social media focus.
The BJP faces a strident, emotive challenge too from the large, deprived masses, and equally from an “aspirational India” to deliver on the economic front. The growing economic, and agrarian distress earlier now compounded manifold by the global coronavirus crisis that will have huge impact on all sections of Indian populace look up at the promise of “acche din” of Modi. If things don’t improve quickly, the party leadership will have to cope with this rising wave of expectations, especially with Modi seen as having the magic wand to deliver on its promises.
In conclusion, the BJP, after 40 years of its founding, should heed to the same stirring speech of Vajpayee in 1980 that the inaugurated it’s political journey. He called upon the party to be a moral force in Indian politics wherein values-based politics, opposition of over centralization and the rule of law would be the governance credo. The BJP can easily prevail over the twin challenge of power and promise by adhering to this guru mantra of its tallest statesman.

This piece is written in that spirit, seeing what the faith community in which i was born and raised has been up to of late. A recent discussion on economist Abusaleh Shariff’s book ‘Instutionalizing Constitutional Rights’ suggested that issues of development do not resonate among middle-class Muslims. Admittedly, once in a while a microscopic proportion of Muslims in Delhi, Mumbai and other metros do discuss these issues. But exceptions do not make a rule.
This is despite a conceptual shift in political and policy thinking about Muslims in India over the last 15 years or so. This shift is from the issues of identity and security to rights-based entitlement to the country’s resources and equal protection of law. But the old discourse within the community does not seem to have changed much, caught as it is in a time warp. There is scant reflection of the larger paradigm shift in Muslim thinking.
What a certain community thinks can be understood from who they follow, what they discuss and debate, their dominant preoccupations, their aspirations. Muslims in their daily life follow their own socio-religious leaders. In crisis they approach political leaders. If one looks at the issues being discussed in masjids, madrasas, seminars, jalsas and Urdu papers, one finds only reactions, complaints, victimhood narratives, besides hair-splitting and feuding over contentious religious dogmas of bewildering diversity.
TV channels have not helped either. For provocation by oafish characters is sexy, development is not. The result is that the discourse is caught in a rut. By way of ‘Muslim issues’, most of the time the discussion is about triple talaq, sharia, fatwas, terror, IS and other peripherals as if Muslim daily life revolves only around these matters.
Why is the discourse among middle-class Muslims not about development, but only about religious identity, security and internal sectarian differences? Is it fair for their leaders to tell them only half of the story? There is no denying that Muslims face discrimination in jobs and admissions and also communal violence. However, claiming that nothing good has happened for Muslims since the Partition is a gross misrepresentation. Muslim leaders are actually pushing the community to victimhood and alienation.
Is it not true that Muslims are also among the beneficiaries of major developmental schemes like MGNREGA, food security measures and Indira Awaas Yojna? And these are not minority-specific programmes. However, one must concede that the benefit to Muslims has not always been in proportion of their share in India’s population. Thus the discourse should have been focussed on how to maximise the benefits. A lot has been done and a lot remains to be done.
Where did the Muslim community leadership fail? Why don’t we see these leaders starting a movement to help deserving Muslims get BPL cards, EWS cards, Voter ID cards, Aadhaar cards, bank loans and making them aware of their rights as citizens? Why has the Muslim leadership not found a discourse appropriate to their needs, the country’s Constitution, its social ethos and the residual trauma of Partition? This discourse must hinge on our common citizenship based national identity rather than on our diverse faiths.
Let me risk some unpopularity to assert that it is the Muslim social and religious leadership which has failed the community. They are the ones who should have been guiding the community. We see the sudden emergence of these self-appointed leaders from their subterranean hibernation when elections are round the corner, making appeals, taking delegations out to meet political leaders and making bargains on behalf of the Muslim masses who hardly care, anyway. Where do they get this impression that the community votes on their advisory?
They often get some personal sops from different parties for making appeals in their favour. If their desires don’t get fulfilled from some parties they loudly complain that the party is ‘not secular’ as if they are a certification authority. They say these are anti-secular parties. But Muslim voters are as mature and smart as any other group. They vote for a party which can take care of their interests. So where do these self-appointed leaders fit in? To tell the truth, nowhere. Some important politicians have publicly snubbed them yet ended up getting more votes than usual.
Such Muslim leadership gains more support because of people like Sadhvi Prachi, Yogi Adityanath and Giriraj Singh. The virulent anti-Muslim vituperation of these worthies sends some frightened Muslims into their religious leaders’ camp. What we must remember is that the idea of India is strong enough to withstand such provocations. But a socio-religious leadership appropriate to the idea of India has to take shape in the days ahead.
There is already a reliable model in the near past – found in Dr Mukhtar Ansari, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Maulana Husain Ahmad Madni, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and their ilk who fought for India’s freedom and also opposed Partition tooth and nail as they believed India is a civilisation, and a civilisation cannot be divided.
They believed that the well-being of Muslims lay in an inclusive vision, not in exclusive politics, in the idea of equal citizenship-based nationality not in markers of separate identity. Muslim socio-religious leadership must remember our solution does not lie in competitive communalism and outsmarting Prachi and Adityanath.

It is as if anyone expressing dissent on the nullification of Article 370 in J&K stands condemned as an enemy of the nation.
Widespread, bristling hyper-nationalism is labelling even constructive criticism as injurious to national sovereignty. The Indian Medical Association recently pronounced that a Lancet editorial on health concerns in Kashmir, was nothing but “an unsolicited intrusion in the Sovereign Republic of India”.
In another display of “muscular” nationalism, BJP MLA Vikram Singh Saini said party workers are excited because they can now marry “fair girls” from Kashmir. Saini had earlier declared that anyone who said they felt unsafe or threatened in India should be “bombed”. These statements are of a piece with Giriraj Singh’s 2014 statement that all those opposed to Modi (then BJP’s PM candidate) should go to Pakistan, or Sakshi Maharaj’s declaration that anyone who was raising questions on the 2015 Yakub Memon death penalty was “anti-national”.
A group of 49 citizens protesting lynchings — among them Aparna Sen and Anurag Kashyap — were dubbed “urban Maoists”. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen too was labelled “Urban Naxal”.
In the storm of labelling, free conversation is almost dead. When labels are deployed by top political leaders, they signal a certain social and political apartheid in which some are considered lesser citizens than others; in the process, hoodlums gain the licence to attack those they dislike.
A massive electoral mandate can’t become the reason to extinguish the democratic chatter altogether. Jawaharlal Nehru won huge mandates too but still allowed a range of critical voices to be heard, although Indira Gandhi did use her big mandate to stifle the Opposition with disastrous results for her own rule.
If an electoral mandate is used to silence free, non-violent opinion in the name of “nationalism”, there’s a danger that protests will move to the street and take on a violent hue, as it happened in the 1970s when Indira Gandhi tried to shut down her critics. Free opinion functions as a safety valve; keep dampening them down and one day they could explode. Indira refused to allow a regional party — the Akalis — to come to power in Punjab; as a result, Sikh grievances gravitated towards Bhindranwale.
A “nationalist” TV channel recently called for social media in India to be shut down in order to summarily silence any “anti-national” perspectives on Kashmir. Another TV channel, in an overthrow of legal process, ran a poll seeking public opinion on whether Kashmiri activist Shehla Rashid should be arrested. When those with a different view are seen as beyond the pale of nationhood itself, any dialogue becomes unfeasible. Polarised minds remain in perpetual search of an enemy within, never mind foreign foes.
In the previous decades of socialist rule, debate was hardly encouraged either. In those bygone days, religion was strictly taboo, state secularism was the holy grail and the Nehru-Gandhi legacy was not to be tarnished at any cost. Today, the Right wing says it’s only doing what the Left once did.
Yet today’s hyper nationalism is a more bludgeoning force than old socialism because it’s focused on emotive religious-nationalist issues. Also, today governments are supported by shrill social media armies which push people into divisive corners. Issues like Article 370, triple talaq and NRC are pitched in such a polarising manner that the nuanced middle ground almost disappears. For example, triple talaq was indeed an injustice on women, but did it need to be criminalised? Should the civil rights violations of those who could become ‘stateless’ in India under NRC not be raised? Is there a constitutional immorality underlying the manner in which Article 370 was scrapped? Exploring these nuanced questions is surely not unpatriotic or anti-national.
Amid politics as spectacle, why shouldn’t there be a more rigorous debate on the economy instead? Unemployment figures remain high; the auto industry says 10 lakh jobs are at stake. Will hyper nationalism permit any questions on the economy or will such questions be called anti-national? This week in the Elgar Parishad case, the Bombay high court pronounced that even possessing copies of certain books could indicate harbouring material “against the state”. The constant search for labels could backfire if it ends up destroying mutual trust and making us our own worst enemies.

The party’s Hindutva base and even a number of Muslims opposed to the writ of religious leaders and personal laws reigning supreme in their community have welcomed the moment. By prescribing three years imprisonment for Muslim men who pronounce the talaq-e-biddat, the law sticks out with rough edges for treating divorce as a criminal offence.
From a system which gave archaic personal laws a long rope for decades to now criminalising practices like triple talaq that it fostered, India is veritably swinging between extremes. The old order had to change, but it is unfortunate that the new law failed to strike a balance. Personal laws gave religious leaders disproportionate influence and denied many people, especially women, the benefits of living in a free society and under meaningful protection of the state. By overriding personal laws, government is indeed doing Muslim women a world of good but in failing to treat triple talaq as a civil offence, as in any other messy divorce case, it may conceivably end up doing more harm than good to the woman.
A legal challenge in Supreme Court is certain to raise issues like proportionality: whether the severity of punishment befits the seriousness of the crime and whether there are less onerous ways of achieving the legislation’s goals. In a sense the social and political cost of not having a Uniform Civil Code, which would have been in tune with the secular ethos of the country, is showing. From Congress “appeasement” of minorities – or to be more precise clerics within minority communities in the hope they would deliver a “vote bank” – the pendulum has now swung to the other extreme where, under a Hindutva-oriented government, the law appears to have a punitive edge for Muslim men.
In a contrary scenario, a UCC would have united the country in true fashion where citizens irrespective of religion would follow the same laws for marriage, divorce, succession, etc. This government has a manifesto that promises UCC and a mandate that can make it happen. It must bite the bullet while earning trust by upholding, rather than debunking, other aspects of secularism as well.

     It is laughable to expect reformist tendencies in a community which is in the vice like grip of its mullahs.No meaningful reforms can be expected from within.Now it will have to come only with the need to ensure uniformity on civic matters through a Uniform Civil Code and practises such as polygamy will have to go among the Muslim community to ensure social harmony among communities.At long last that has become the need of the hour....

"1616953640-198","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","LAC standoff: Modi govt will find its way","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-fact/lac-standoff-modi-govt-will-find-its-way/","LAC standoff: Modi govt will find its way","July 3, 2020, 9:23 PM  IST","Purushottam Jha","In place of Raksha Mantri who was supposed to be at Leh, visit of Prime Minister accompanied by the Chief of Defense Staff has deeper meaning and relevance for the defense establishment, for the country at large, for China as also for the international community. That very little is officially put out in public domain speaks a lot and has multi-faceted meaning which many amongst us are failing to appreciate and are taking the govt to task day in and day out. Congress, in particular, is out with all its venom vomiting against the govt even at this crisis riddled juncture of the country. In the face of the fact now that the crisis is going to take its time given the complications of the situation at LAC and most importantly the resolute resolve of the govt to protect every inch of our land and our irreversible sovereignty over it. 
There may be many drawbacks of the govt’s handling the situation but the one underlying fact of the inseparable characteristic of Narendra Modi must be kept in mind and absolutely relied upon – that he will take out the country of this crisis holding the head high and chest wide. 
Those really concerned and worried about the situation must keep in mind many factors surrounding the standoff that this is not a mere battle for few kilometers of land of this side or that side. This battle and the ultimate result thereof is going to prove many points, set in motion many forces and also put to rest many assumptions of international ethos and ethics. Those of us who have read and really understood Mahabharata, would vouch that battle too was not for merely a piece of land, the purpose was too wider and deeper and one of the outcomes of the battle was the propagation of eternal Geeta setting values of rights, wrongs and ideals of the era. None of the participants of the battle did ever imagine Mahabharata would end so many things and would give rise to so many other things. And this analogy has nothing to do with the philosophical part of the battle at all.
When a simple RSS pracharak became the Prime Minister of the largest democracy he dreamt differently as he was somewhat different – he wished see his country amongst the greatest of the nations. His RSS days and his days in solitude had already enshrined in him deeply the Bharat having been too rich both in soft power and material power – Sone ki Chidiya as well as the Vishwaguru.  He has been restless in his pursuit of seeing India the great power and all his endeavors have been directed towards that mission. It would be observed that he dared went beyond public perception and did not mind face mercurial mood of the people at times. Legislations like triple talaq, CAA, J & K Resolutions etc were aimed at freeing the country of unnecessary baggage of the past on the one hand and making a strong run-way to take off high at the global level. One may very well differ the ways adopted but must not doubt complete honesty of intent and purpose on his part. 
There have been enormous questions on his foreign visits but the results too have been enormous. One may downplay the achievements as not all achievements are material, many are soft achievements too. Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister, always felt and was seen at par with his head held high with any other executive head of the globe and this made space for the country in the international arena. Any and all great powers of the world began to see India with prestige having remarkable standing, stature and reputation to reckon with. All this created jealousy and also fear especially in the region. And when amidst middle of Covid-19, Narendra Modi talked of Atmanirbhar Bharat and vocal for local, perhaps it became too much and a diversion and break in the speed was envisaged. 
Everyone understands that the days are not of either Mao in China or of Nehru in India. Any war will not lead anywhere. Both will have to come back, sit, ponder over, accept each other and proceed either comradely or separately. China under Xi Jinping feels itself superior to any in cultural and also in political ethos and it has been trying injecting this by all means including militarily. Its behavior towards Taiwan, Hong Kong, South China Sea and now with India has been rather irritating looking like unbecoming of a prudent and responsible state. Its closed and autocratic system helps it to great extent in going ahead mysteriously with its design but this also limits its vision and outlook. It fails to foresee multipolar world with many super powers simultaneously. It has virtually made all powerful nations interdependent with it by trade and commerce – so all can grumble to an extent and then see towards each other with blank question marks. 
But then India with Narendra Modi stands tall and vibrant too. The fertile land of democracy does have its limitations – limitations of pulling back by own people, but then the world may not be in a position to ignore its aura and glory either – it talks of self-reliance but it also believes in Jai Jagat. Thus India’s position becomes paradoxical. International response towards the crisis has been too measured – the consensus feeling being that both India and China are matured and reasoned and would find their amicable solution. 
But many countries apparently are keeping their fingers crossed – with some feeling that Beijing would put some check on Delhi’s global aspirations and some that Delhi would be able to bell the ever growling cat somehow. 
Moscow, of course, may emerge a dark horse if at all some state’s intervention pacifies the growing ill will between the two. Moscow is too important for both China and India – economically, strategically and politically. Both are important for it also in many ways. India has been nourishing the relations as ever and Russia has been a time tested friend – every crisis is a testimony to this. With the developments in the background there might be many things hidden under the carpet and may influence both the sides to come to terms. Moscow’s diplomatic interventions, unlike the US, would not irk any. With Putin having the mandate of his country to remain in power till 2036, he is in most convenient position to set and convince the both. The international flow, undoubtedly, as at present is against China and its misadventure at the LAC is aimed at erasing and resetting the international tone about it. 
But the supreme sacrifice of twenty Indian brave hearts has made India taller and mightier while this confirmed China’s utter disregard to international rules of the game as well as the mutual agreements in vogue. Attacking on an unprepared and unwarned force is no one’s baby even in today’s world.
Anguished India has already many economic withdrawals done in between. From Maharashtra to Bihar to BSNL and MTNL to Roadways to IT and soft wares – effect to the date would be in thousands of Crores with many more to come. China will be at huge loss continuing the standoff and getting nothing out of it. India, for one, is not going to accept anything than status quo as in April. And China is not going to lose anything by agreeing to that. Narendra Modi’s govt has the core ethos of masculine nationalism and it will never allow to even let any power touch upon that. The country should be rest assured of this minimum attribute of the govt of the day. Situation demands immense support from all quarters for the govt!

Don’t get me wrong. It is not that there wasn’t any dislocation of everyday life or that there was no panic triggered by rumours and a paucity of information. There was. The Pakistani Uber driver in London who told me that India had confiscated the money of its people may have been wilfully gloating, but he was also reflecting the panic that inevitably sets in when something so dramatic happens abruptly. And the section of India that is either too poor or too disconnected from the media to gauge the implications of such a drastic financial move is quite understandably nervous, even if they have never seen a Rs 1,000 note.
This is also to be not unmindful of the chattering classes’ real concern for the welfare of their maids, maalis and vegetable vendors. In all likelihood, they were aware of the dramatic consequences of the government move and, indeed, may have earlier even argued for zero tolerance of black money — while, at the same time, pointing out that no government would do anything because the politicians were part of the problem. It is just that they did not want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to run away with all the credit for finally acting on his promise to effect a surgical strike on a problem that had begun plaguing India since the late 1960s, after socialism, high taxes and plain venality forced many Indians to make dishonesty a way of life. Just as their notional faith in democracy didn’t prevent the angst-ridden classes in America from coming out on the streets to protest Donald Trump’s victory in a free election, the disquiet in India was not against the measure but the man whose political will made such a bold step possible.

That indeed is the issue that baffles the bleeding hearts. The fact that a politician had directed a strike that is calculated (among other things) to decimate the rogue war chests of the political class as a whole seems quite inexplicable. After all, conventional wisdom had deemed that election funding was entirely a function of the underground cash economy, as indeed were lucrative businesses in property and trade.
Common sense and anecdotal evidence suggests that politicians are inclined to pamper their assured vote banks. Mamata Banerjee, for example, won’t stand up for gender justice on the triple talaq issue because she is far too dependant on the support of conservative Muslim organisations; and the Congress will drag its feet on fast-tracking the citizenship of Hindus and Sikhs from neighbouring countries because it wants that facility to be extended to Bangladeshi Muslims in Assam and West Bengal and even the Rohingyas from Myanmar. By that logic, the BJP would be loath to hit at the material interests of the trading community that has faithfully stood by it for long. It is hardly a state secret that the biggest source of black money generation is trade.
What we are witnessing is something quite fascinating — the ability of an elected leader to use his mandate to look beyond sectional interests and address the national interest. Modi has actually taken a huge political risk by offending an influential section of the BJP’s traditional support for the sake of a higher national purpose, one that is calculated to make India more wholesome, if properly followed through.
In 2007, during the Gujarat assembly election, Modi had come under intense party pressure to waive the dues and the prosecution of more than one lakh farmers caught pilfering electricity through unauthorised connections. At that time Modi had privately told his colleagues that he would rather step down from leadership than agree to this short-sighted amnesty. His calculation was that the electorate will appreciate forthrightness and loftiness of purpose.
In Gujarat, the approach paid off. It is now on test in the whole of India. What we are witnessing is the leadership of a man who looks far beyond narrow calculations and towards the rebuilding of India as a world power. His audacity is admirable, but equally praiseworthy is his vision of India’s future.

Legal robes hide our Constitution’s formidable musculature. This is evident, in recent times, from the way Sabarimala and triple talaq have been dealt with in the courts. In this connection we need to keep in mind two sets of considerations. First, when politicians quarrel over diverse interpretations of the Constitution it shows that they, knowingly or unknowingly, hold it in high regard.
If our Constitution were disrespected, we would not have wanted to enter its control room, as often as we do, to justify our political positions. One would never fight over something that is intrinsically without value. The Constitution is also an active participant; it is not a tree that has to be shaken every time.
This brings us to the second issue. All too often we find morality and constitutionality at loggerheads, and that is actually good news. As the two function on contrary principles one can hardly expect them to be on the same side.
Moralists invariably shut people in different boxes. This is done on the basis of caste, religion, language, age, etc, with clear action prescriptions, if not a widely accepted how-to-do kit. A democratic constitution dynamites these lids open because it operates in the opposite direction; it promotes inclusive citizenship and not exclusive identities.
Sabarimala activists and supporters of triple talaq are moralists because they actively encourage divisions among people who should be united as citizens. It is then the job of the Constitution to set us right whenever we are tempted, by our essentially pre-democratic instinct, to take the high moral ground.
A liberal, democratic constitution does not come easy; it is the outcome of long deliberation as our Constituent Assembly debates testify. Morality, on the other hand, is effortless as it requires prejudice, not intellect, to bolster it.
Distancing oneself from others begins and ends with loving oneself to distraction. A democratic constitution, contrarily, demands we make common cause with those who are different from us for our mutual advantage. Therefore, to expect a constitution to behave morally is to throw in the towel before the contest has even begun.
When Sabarimala separated men from women of a certain age, the prime mover was morality and not the law. When the Supreme Court struck it down, it acted constitutionally, that is legally, because it cannot suffer segregation of any kind. But Sabarimala, be it known, also provided the occasion to demonstrate the strength that five unarmed judges can have over a mob.
One may disagree with what the judges say but this is something only other judges can overturn, not roadside propagandists. If the battle still rages on this matter it is because Sabarimala activists accept the fact that their morality must get the Constitution’s sanction.
Likewise, with triple talaq. Here we have another moral issue because it is essentially separatist in intent as it privileges men over women among Indian Muslims.
The Constitution must obviously oppose this foursquare and it does not require much foresight to conclude what the Supreme Court’s decision would be. It is unthinkable that a liberal democratic constitution would allow for such gender based discrimination.
In these conditions a moralist cannot resist but reach out for blunt instruments. Yet, once the courts have de-recognised instant “triple talaq” it is now of no consequence whether a Muslim man utters these words, or not. He might as well say “cheers” or “howzatt”, or anything else, thrice, or in multiples of three, but that would make no difference.
As far as the law is concerned, declaring “talaq” thrice in quick succession is a useless exercise if a Muslim man has divorce on his mind. It is at this point that moralists come in to wreck the furniture, but the Constitution will always be the adult in the room.
One set of moralists want the man to be punished for simply saying “talaq” thrice, even though those words are now useless and accomplish nothing. This is a moral position as it separates Hindu men from Muslim men and conceals the existing constitutional law against domestic violence that applies to all.
What is relevant here is that as talaq is legally invalid, a Muslim man can be charged for turning out his wife without proper economic support. This is a straightforward case of domestic violence and, according to law, it holds not only for Hindus and Muslims but for every community.
Moralists on both sides don’t like this. Muslim moralists and virtuosos want their male co-religionists to remain privileged. On the other side, those who believe triple talaq is fundamentally punishment worthy are being moral too.
This is because they are separating themselves from the Muslim community by not emphasising the religion-neutral law against domestic violence. Fortunately, both sides are appealing to our Constitution and this can only make it stronger.
The Indian Constitution has faced many such moralist challenges and has come out the winner. When we look back at these victories, every Republic Day has a special quality about it. If the Rajpath is festive today it is because many Janpaths, with diverse moralities, have surrendered their egos and merged into it.

India has woken up to its own #MeToo moment with professional women calling out sexual predators in workplaces and in power equations. It is yet another milestone in India’s evolution as an egalitarian society. 

Until now, India has hardly ever seen an urban working women’s revolution. Compared to the West, where women led suffragette movements and later sexual revolution against gender discrimination, the Indian constitution from the very outset guaranteed women equal rights. While the Hindu Marriage Act removed various discriminations, Muslim women have also been independently fighting for equal rights under their personal law since the Shah Bano case. Recently, Muslim women won a major battle against the practice of instant triple talaq.

Though most laws favour women in India sexual violence, abuse and harassment remain rampant. The 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape case galvanised women cutting across class, caste, religion and sect, following which more stringent laws against rape were introduced. With regard to sexual harassment at workplaces, the 1997 Vishakha guidelines of the Supreme Court were superseded by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act (SHOWWA) in 2013. 

Yet, until now, sexual harassment in the corridors and citadels of power—workspaces— was a lonely battle for individual victims. The US #MeToo found resonance but it took almost a year for Indian working women in urban centres to speak up in unison. Social media, which is a great leveller, has played a huge role in enabling women to share their stories. Instant support from the public has strengthened and empowered more women to come forward. 

Indian professional women standing up and speaking truth to power is, therefore, a significant turning point in the struggle for women’s dignity at workplaces. The aim of the campaign should be to force employers to abide by the SHOWW Act, investigate charges and punish those found guilty so that office spaces become dignified and secure places for women to work in. However, it is equally important that women do not trivialize the movement by levelling frivolous and unsubstantiated charges with an agenda to witch-hunt or settle political scores against men of repute and integrity.

     This is turning out to be a great opportunity for those women who have faced a distressing situation of advances from a colleague or anyone else! BUT this is also becoming a â   BEHTI GANGA ME HAATH DHONAâ   kind of crusade for many other swho are wish to settle a grudge against sombody by falsely accusing him of sexual misconduct!! And assumption by the media and people that you are guilty unless proven otherwise is turning justice on its head!! Because men or woman , neither of the two can be considered â   Doodh ka dhulaâ   or completely free of quirks of character !!...  Read More

It will start on December 15, a day after polling ends in Gujarat, and have 14 sittings over 22 days. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Union minister for minority affairs, explains the government’s version for the delay in commencing the winter session of Parliament to Pratigyan Das: 
 <img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-95889"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Naqvi-786x1024.jpg"" alt="""" width=""474"" height=""618"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Naqvi-786x1024.jpg 786w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Naqvi-230x300.jpg 230w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Naqvi-768x1000.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"">
What was the controversy regarding winter session of Parliament all about? 
Well, there is no controversy at all. And those who are trying to create a confusion about it are either clueless about the history of parliamentary democracy and election or are just trying to create a hue and cry over nothing. It is unfortunate that Congress is making a non-issue a big issue. A democratic set up has a specific process, and in fact if an election coincides with the sessions, political parties request to defer the dates of Parliament session so that political leaders can give time to campaigning. It becomes difficult for parliamentarians to concentrate both on campaigning and attending session at the same time. However, surprisingly, this is for the first time that Congress and some others were demanding the session to go along with the elections. Besides, it’s not unusual to defer or shorten Parliament sessions. In the past, even Budget sessions have been shortened during general elections.
But why were dates not recommended by Cabinet till Friday? 
We need to understand that elections and Parliament sessions can’t and shouldn’t overlap with each other. Both are part of our constitutional commitment and if they overlap, we will fail to do justice to our voters and the august house. Moreover, dates of elections are not decided by the government. The Election Commission decides it taking various factors into consideration. In the winter session of Parliament, opposition will get a befitting reply to every question they pose in the House.
Opposition alleged that government was postponing the session as it fears a backlash on GST and demonetisation. What is your take? 
Well, let me put facts in place. On GST, we have had over six discussions on the floor of the House. So is the case with Aadhaar. Besides, there have been discussions in the Parliament and select committee as well. We have discussed other issues as well. But still if opposition wants to raise any issue, we are open to discuss and reply as per the rules of the House. Having said that I feel Congress is demanding a session not for the sake of discussion but to influence Gujarat election through speeches in the Parliament.
TMC says there should be a fixed calendar for the sessions of Parliament. What is your view? 
Fixed calendar can be possible if we go ahead with simultaneous election – one nation, one election. With different states going for polls on different dates, it is impractical to fix dates for sessions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been talking about simultaneous election and it’s an ideal deal as well but there has to be a consensus among the political parties to get a nod on it.
There are also reports that your government plans to introduce Triple Talaq Bill in this session. 
Triple Talaq is a social evil and it has nothing to do with religion. The apex court has already called it unconstitutional and illegal. So, there have been demands from several quarters to make a law to abolish it. In the light of the Supreme Court verdict, we are sincerely mulling over it.
Is it a step forward towards uniform civil code? 
Well as far as UCC is concerned, the Supreme Court has directed every government to create a consensus on it by discussing with all stakeholders. The law commission has been working on it and it will be introduced if there is a consensus among all. But then we also need to understand that UCC doesn’t mean it will curtail the freedom and practices of any religion.
But will it be a reality in this government? 
This is a government of reform. Our government is bringing reforms, performing and transforming. We have brought in big reforms. But it’s too early to say about UCC.
What are your views on Rahul Gandhi’s elevation? 
At present, Congress is on a ventilator and Rahul Gandhi is on an elevator. The party that is surviving on ventilator can’t be expected to revive despite the elevation of Rahul Gandhi.
Nitish Kumar has called for reservations in private sector. Your views? 
On reservation, opinions vary from people to people. But it is also a fact that a section of the society is still backward and requires opportunity to come to the mainstream. We are committed towards equal opportunity to all sections of the society.

In many ways, 2014 marks a point of inflection in India’s governance and policy paradigm. For the first time a non-Congress government won a full majority in the Lok Sabha. The Narendra Modi-led government has since rewritten the grammar of change. In the last 63 months, dozens of signature policy initiatives have not only brought about significant qualitative improvement in people’s lives, but also pitchforked India as a global growth engine, cementing its status of eminence among the world’s leading nations.
The hallmark of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been his strong willed approach. The nullification of Article 370 and abolition of Article 35A, despite the opposition’s inexplicable resistance, as also the lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha, exemplify this determination. Article 370 in its original form and Article 35A were not compatible with India’s development aspirations, as these severely restricted the state’s progress and, also, promoted separatism. Terrorism has killed more than 41,000 people in the state, while a few families merrily pocketed the bulk of central government aid, pushing an entire generation into poverty.
The peculiar brand of appeasement politics, coupled with lack of political will, ensured that no leader dared to change the “special status” of J&K perpetuated through Articles 370 and 35A. The Modi government’s decision on Article 370 and Article 35A, and the passage of the relevant Bills in both houses of Parliament illustrate Modi’s resolve and political statesmanship to actualise the “one nation-one Constitution” principle, and lead Jammu and Kashmir into a new era of development.
Likewise, moves such as demonetisation, GST, abolition of the evil practice of triple talaq, air strike and surgical strike on terror launch pads across the border, one rank one pension, direct benefit transfer (DBT), institutionalisation of chief of defence staff (CDS), UAPA amendment bill and constitutional status to OBC Commission, which were hitherto seen as difficult asks, were executed by the Modi government. These moves certainly make him the most strong willed prime minister India has ever seen.
Successive governments since independence have implemented a policy matrix through a binary prism: rich-poor, industry-agriculture, and cities-villages. This approach presented a set of self-imposed contradictions. For instance, there evolved a perplexing strand of thought that the poor can develop only if the interest of rich is compromised and vice versa. Modi has demolished this baffling attitude by making a clarion call: “There are only two classes: the poor and those who want to eradicate poverty.”
Ensuring ease of living has been the primary pillar of the Modi government’s governance doctrine. Jan Dhan, Mudra, DBT, house for all, electricity for all, LPG for all, crop insurance scheme, increased MSP for farmers, pension schemes for small entrepreneurs and working class, and Kisan Samman Nidhi: all epitomise this approach. In addition specific policy initiatives have been taken for the development of historically marginalised social segments such as SC, ST, OBC and women.
Modi has always believed that a country cannot advance if the business community does not lead this progress. His emphasis on the role of wealth creators in a nation’s growth underlines the importance this government attaches to the business community. From overhauling a creaky banking system, clamping down on corruption, enhancing investments in infrastructure, to GST and procedural simplification – all have turned India into a much easier place to do business. India remains the world’s fastest growing major economy and is cantering towards the $5 trillion GDP mark.
Under Modi’s stewardship India’s status on the world stage has grown by leaps and bounds. When India carried out surgical strikes and air strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan, the world’s leading nations stood by us, while our neighbour was, and continues to remain, isolated. Recognition of Yoga International Day, UN’s Champion of Earth Award to Modi, leading role in International Solar Alliance initiative, successful launch of Chandrayaan and highest number of simultaneous satellite launches from India are some examples of India’s growing international stature.
National security remains non-negotiable for this government. The decision to appoint a CDS, modernisaton of the armed forces as well as successful launch of anti-satellite missile demonstrates the government’s steadfast focus to protect India on all fronts: land, sky, sea and space. The decision to implement the long-standing demand for OROP also mirrors the government’s firmness to keep the morale of India’s soldiers high.
The contrast between previous administrations and the Modi government is clear. While earlier governments’ decisions were primarily guided by the sole objective of retaining power, the Modi government is focused on pushing changes of long-term significance, no matter if they don’t seem popular in the near run. This has resulted in courageous policy and legislative moves even in the face of widely perceived political risks. PM’s popularity shows that when tough measures are taken with popular welfare as the sole consideration, people reward you with wholesome support. The overwhelming mandate in 2019 that bettered even the 2014 record is a testimony to this.

     India became independent from the British in 1947 and the British slaves in 2014. Therefore, in the true sense, India became independent only in May 2014. The Ghandy Congress and the left parties still follow British policies of dividing and looting India, whenever they can. However, their supporters are fast dwindling....

While most of the opposition to CAA is crassly political, ignorance of a large section of the society provided fertile ground for scare mongering and politics of manufactured paranoia.
However, there appears a method in the madness. Congress and other opposition parties have sensed an opportunity to go back to the era of pseudo-secularism with vote bank politics at its core. Post Shah Bano and Ayodhya movement, Congress and others had tried to give some different signals. When the heydays of socialism were over Sharad Pawar – who had earlier named his breakaway group as Socialist Congress – sensed the changing winds and named his new party in 1999 as Nationalist Congress.
Congress too had resorted to what the media described as soft Hindutva. Ram Van Gaman Path finding a mention in Congress manifesto for MP elections last year, is a case in point. However, these cosmetic changes failed to earn any rewards in 2019. Frustrated, the only option before the grand old party of India was to resort to its old tactic of vote bank politics.

Most parties other than BJP are accustomed to look at Muslims plainly and simply as a vote bank. But the situation has changed now. This is hardly surprising as minorities in New India too have aspirations for a prosperous future, where Jammu & Kashmir could attract investment and Muslim women could rightfully hope for equal respect and protection from injustice. However, in CAA this vote bank politics found a breather as a massive misinformation campaign has been unleashed on it.
Efforts to once again look at the minorities as a vote bank are bound to fall flat for three specific reasons. First, the more people gathered deeper insight into the provisions of CAA, the faster has been the return to normalcy. In essence, CAA only gives priority and facilitation to the most persecuted amongst the lot seeking refuge in India.
Existing laws are capable enough to grant citizenship to even Muslims and that too from any country on Earth, albeit after a stay in India for 11 years. The period of wait for persecuted minorities is shortened simply because they are already here for years. Simply put, this is positive discrimination, almost akin to giving priority to women or marginalised sections of society, or to the physically challenged. As reiterated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, Indian citizens have absolutely no reason to worry about provisions of CAA.
Second, minorities, especially Muslims, cannot be hoodwinked any further with the same old tactics. They know how successive governments played into the hands of regressive elements harping only on emotive issues. It was during NDA-1 that computers made their first entry into most of the madrasas. Similarly, it was the resoluteness of the Modi government that saw the practice of triple talaq being ended through a law. Efforts to promote a culture of entrepreneurship amongst the minorities and especially Muslims got a remarkable fillip during NDA-2. The key to this transformation was a changed outlook that refused to consider minorities as just guaranteed vote banks.
Third, slowly but certainly, sections amongst the Muslims are realising that in an age of aspirations, issues other than identity issues are fast becoming more critical. Already, the traditional thinking that Muslims may not accept the law banning triple talaq, or nullification of Article 370, or the apex court judgment on Ayodhya issue has been unquestionably demolished. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Muslim male youngsters may not want their female counterparts to get equality of respect, of security and of opportunities as well.
Lastly, it would be educative – especially for those criticising the government for its alleged disregard to a more populistic opinion – to understand what Edmund Burke had said in his famous address. He had said, “Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.” Modi, like a true leader, is using his judgement for the larger good of countrymen.

But the wedding season among politicians is only just beginning. With elections ahead it is the season of shaadi politics, which is sometimes spelt as shady politics. There are many wedding ceremonies afoot with alliances, unions and family coalitions. We desis love weddings even if the Big Fat Indian Wedding is sometimes Big Fat Indian politics. At weddings we have band baaja, in politics its voter ka band baja diya.
Who is marrying whom? In Kolkata we saw a mass wedding presided over by the Didi of alliances in which alliance partners lined up for the muhurat. Sharad Pawar, Tejashwi Yadav, Farooq Abdullah, HD Deve Gowda, Chandrababu Naidu, the mahagathbandhan at Brigade, Kolkata is a wedding in which it’s caste, community and religion no bar, only politics bar bar. BJD’s Naveen Patnaik and TRS’s K Chandrashekar Rao preferred to play blushing bride and not take the risk of being ditched at the altar. That’s because they have their own wedding plans even though for the moment they seem hit by commitment phobia.
The alliances of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati tend to be characterised by the seven year itch, or more accurately the 7 month itch. Didi who once allied with the Vajpayee government, then left the NDA, then allied with the UPA, then left the UPA now prefers to be single but ready to mingle. Mayawati always has eager rishtas waiting for her but she too prefers to love ’em and leave ’em even if it’s still the honeymoon period.
Marriages may be made in heaven, but political shaadis are made at the ballot box. Since there’s always an X factor in every political alliance, the question must be asked, pati, patni and who? While bride and groom step together during the saath feras with fire as witness, political alliance partners often fall out of step with the voter as helpless witness.
While guests are given pulao and mithai at weddings, at political shaadis slogans and manifestos are the main course. At weddings we hear the shehnai, at political shaadis we hear only speeches.
The ruling BJP finds itself without too many suitors at the moment. That’s because in BJP’s swayamvar there is only one potential bridegroom and many parties have already uttered triple talaq. In the season of alliances, miyan and biwi are raazi, but is the voter willing to play qazi?

The ‘yet’ is important. It’s been around three months since BJP was re-elected with an overwhelming mandate. Fairness demands that we give the government some more time. But the contrast is already striking.
And this is not just because the dramatic Jammu & Kashmir reorganisation bills were shepherded adroitly. Even when there’s been less drama, the government has been quite efficient on matters of welfare and security.
The first Cabinet meeting of this term extended the farmer income support scheme. Then, the government made clean water availability a signature theme. Then, in the budget session that saw 28 bills being passed – a 10-year record – welfare-themed legislations were prominent. Included in this list are laws on banning triple talaq, a new consumer welfare regulator, minimum wages, making Aadhaar a voluntary KYC option for individuals, and banning unregulated deposits.
National security saw crucial, if not controversy-free, interventions via the passage of amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Investigation Agency Act.

This is a partial list – but even then it’s clear proof of a government knowing what it wants and doing what is required. In economic management, though, and sticking to the legislative record, perhaps the only example of such surefootedness was the swift drafting and passage of amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These changes were necessary in part after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal put operational and financial creditors on a par in bankruptcy resolution, putting lending banks at great risk.
The other major economic legislation was amending the Companies Act that penalises some violations of corporate social responsibility norms with jail terms for executives. This was a classic case of aiming a totally unnecessary government bazooka at a small corporate problem. And entirely predictably, it made business leaders even more antsy.
India Inc was antsy anyway because the passage of the biggest economic legislation of the budget session, the Finance Bill aka the Budget, didn’t seemingly do much to soothe concerns over macro, market and sectoral bad news.
And so, unusually for a government that has been so confident and assured in non-economic matters, its economic management has so far produced more questions than answers.
A sample of questions:

 Has the government done enough to address a clear economic slowdown?
 Is the slowdown structural or cyclical, meaning deeper or a soon-to-reverse variety?
 If it’s the former, is there a structural consumption problem as well, meaning, have consumption appetites of India’s better off classes been satiated and therefore is increasing aam admi consumption the big challenge?
 Even if it’s a cyclical slowdown we are facing, can sectoral problems be addressed by a gentle macro turnaround?
 With the global economy not providing a growth impetus to India, can domestic policy take the economy beyond 6-6.5% growth rate in the next two or three years? Bear in mind that most economists reckon India’ absolute minimum annual average GDP growth rate should be 7% for any meaningfully quick economic transformation.

Given these questions, what are we hearing from the government?
Post-Budget, the finance ministry has held a number of consultations with industry and market leaders, and the media has reported that a revival package may be in the offing. Automobiles, real estate, credit markets and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are reportedly sectors/ actors that may get close attention in a revival package.
A point to note here is that the Budget itself hadn’t indicated any need for specific revival packages and that bar the market’s unhappiness over the new tax surcharge on the rich, which affects FPIs, none of the bad economic trends was unknown before the Budget. Therefore, there’s a question whether the Budget was a major lost opportunity, assuming there’s a post-Budget economic booster in the offing.
In his extensive interview with ET, the prime minister made a number of broad statements of intent. Significant among these was his asking bankers to lend more, assuring that their decisions taken “in good faith” won’t lead to “witch hunts”.
Linked to this was his argument that banks’ bad loans problem was getting tackled and that more lendable resources are being made available to financial credit suppliers and that this, plus improved capacity utilisation by industry will lead to an uptick in private investment. The PM’s central argument seemed to be that process improvement will lead to a growth revival.
At this point, we do not either know whether there will be a so-called revival package – and what form it will take – or whether the assumption that process improvement will sooner rather than later change the economic tempo will bear out.
Therefore, it is fair to conclude that the questions we asked are difficult to answer as yet from what we can discern on government thinking on economic management. And that given the real dips in many economic numbers, such uncertainty can legitimately be a cause for worry.
So, to go back to the contrast we pointed out at the beginning of this commentary, such an approach doesn’t characterise the government’s management of social welfare and national security issues.
To put it mildly, this is not a contrast India can afford for too long.

It is apparent by how God is personified as male, thereby lending men higher spiritual authority. Many religions don’t allow women from entering places of worship, while some forbid them from coming close to the main sanctum. Our religious texts often assign to women, moral inferiority, and physical manifestations such as periods are grounds for disallowing women from worshipping their deities. Our struggles during the Sabarimala unrest as well as Muslim women’s fight against Triple Talaq are some examples of how Religion disenfranchises women. Religion empowers a section of its practitioners, who are mostly men, thereby relegating women to being insolent or insurgent.

Dalai Lama’s grossly sexist and inappropriate statement on the viability of a woman leading the charge in his wake depending on her physical attractiveness is a specimen of the problematic prism Buddhism or any other religion, espouses. The Tibetan Buddhist leader’s sexist quip ruffled quite a few feathers. He is a spiritual figurehead, yet he has to be held to the same standards as everyone else. His position as a public figure only burdens him to espouse the right argument, which often dictates the conversation that trickles down to his followers. While it is great that the octogenarian monk is not opposed to the idea of being possibly succeeded by a female Dalai Lama, it is disenchanting to witness a man of compassion have such retrograde opinions.
Perpetuating the idea that women are mere ornaments, that they should be ‘seen’ and not ‘heard’, only adds to the discrimination women face, even in the 21st century. Women have had to carve out a rough road to inch their way towards equality in the midst of chaos, even in a relatively modern religion like Buddhism. The Orange Revolution in Thailand is a testament to this struggle. It is led by a new breed of female nuns who are fighting their way to becoming fully ordained, officially outlawed by Thai laws. Devdutt Patnaik, in one of his articles, rightly brings to fore the misogyny so firmly entrenched in Buddhism. ‘’There are more rules for nuns (bhikkunis) than monks (bhikkus), 331 as against 227, because while everyone has to control their desires, women have the additional burden of not “arousing the desires of men.” 
Due to the outrage, Dalai Lama had to double down on his comment. “It sometimes happens that off the cuff remarks, which might be amusing in one cultural context, lose their humor in translation when brought into another,” a statement on his behalf said. While the Dalai Lama may appear to be a modern messiah compared to his Thai counterparts, his comment comes as a stark reminder of the male gaze in the spiritual realm and its deep-seated religious roots.

     I appriciate yr writing skills but levels of misunderstanding is not acceptable atleast when its His Highness Dalai Lama. If u really follow his interviews , you would know he talks with a pinch of spice. He does not take himself very seriously. And thats what make him the most attractive persona. It is about this attraction and magnetic personality that he is talking about. Any leader has to attractive....then why not spirutual leader, only then people will take intrest in what she or he has to say. Dear friend plz save yr harsh pen for people who deserve it, n i m sure there are lots....  Read More

Triple talaq confers instantaneous and unilateral power on a husband to divorce his wife, which is especially skewed when one considers economic means and resources are also most often concentrated with the husband. It is, therefore, a human rather than political issue.
Surely, Modi is also right to argue that Indian philosophical traditions are rich enough so that the impetus to reform can come from within rather than being seen as a foreign imposition, and that Indian Muslims could show the path to modernity worldwide. The problem, though, is that the urge to politicise such sensitive social matters is present as much within BJP, the PM’s party, as anywhere else.
As if to underline that, on the very same day the PM expressed his hopes for reform of triple talaq, BJP minister Swami Prasad Maurya in Yogi Adityanath’s UP cabinet unhelpfully invoked stereotypes of the lustful Muslim by bringing up how Muslim men supposedly use triple talaq as a device to “satiate their lust” (as if lust is a propensity of Muslims alone, or for that matter of men alone). This stereotype of the lustful Muslim, it is worth noting, is also at play whenever the spectre of “love jihad” is frequently raised by the Sangh Parivar. Such stigmatising talk from BJP ministers and other luminaries is bound to make Muslim reformers’ task harder.
Part of the reason why triple talaq remains on the statute books in India when it has been abolished even by many Muslim countries is that such matters are inevitably politicised by political parties as well as social bodies such as the Muslim Personal Law Board. While the Indian Constitution is secular, this is a principle they recognise only selectively, when it suits them. Thus while BJP demands a Uniform Civil Code, it also promotes Hindutva principles limiting freedom of worship and wants a Ram temple to be set up at the site of a mosque which its affiliated activists demolished. While BJP’s opponents are not in favour of Hindutva, they condone oppressive practices among minorities in order to cultivate vote banks. This double bind is why human and social issues get politicised, leading to polarised responses and making the fight against triple talaq harder.

     may i, please?1. yes, islam rules that wife is subordinate to the husband; the husband does have the right to dissolve the marriage unilaterally, the wife does not; that is religion, take it or leave it.  it has also been said that triple talaq is traditional custom; it is not so, it is religion. islam  is not for gender equality of the kind of leaving the sheep among the wolves on equal terms. illicit sex is capital sin; hence arises the practice of hijab, and segregation of sexes, to minimize such misfortunes.2. there is a tendency nowadays to pass judgement about things whether they be islamic or not by anybody. the muslim personal law: is it part of islam? who knows about islam? let us accept that the religious scholars, the ulema, who have devoted their lives in the study of the relgious texts, know more about islam than the government, or the law commission, or the supreme court, or the intellectuals, including the muslim ones. if they declare that the muslim personal law is islamic, then so it is. india is a democracy and it has a constitution which is its codebook. it prescribes gender equality, as is understood in the modern times. islam is not for this gender equality. the constitution also guarantees freedom to practice one&rsquo;s religion, and it does not undertake to define one&rsquo;s professed religion. now, the constitution was framed largely by the congress, which took along people of all shades of opinion, a true representative of the nation, following truly the credo of &lsquo;sab ka saath&rsquo;: come together as you are, not as we tell you. they resolved the conflict through bypassing it, that is, including the demands for a ucc in the non-mandatory directive principles. some say that they acted unfortunately in this regard; i think they acted wisely. let unnecessary, immaterial distractions be ignored and move on to really important things....

So actually triple talaq was banned in 2002 on the ground of it being derogatory to the holy Quran and the 2017 decision also found it to be violative of fundamental rights.
We do not know the exact number of the instances of triple talaq since 2002, but we know that within four months after the SC verdict of 2017, the number of women who have been subjected to this enormity is more than one hundred. Now one can easily say that these persons who took recourse to triple divorce showed no respect either for the Supreme Court or for their own scripture. But other than these offenders, there were prominent clerics of the Muslim personal law board who publicly asserted that notwithstanding the SC verdict, the practice will continue as according to them it finds sanction in religion.

Now the question is whether the government should remain a mute spectator of this blatant violation of the law as laid down by the Supreme Court. If that happens then it would be an abdication of its moral and constitutional duties. One of the primary duties of the executive is to enforce and implement the laws both originated in the legislature or laid down by the higher judiciary.
The manner in which the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 received the approval of Lok Sabha encouraged me to believe in the maturity of the political class and their capability to learn from past experiences, particularly the bad ones. I entertained the hope that now political expediency shall not be allowed to come in the way of gender justice. But within days the personal law board was able to flex its muscles and succeeded in rallying enough support to ensure that the new bill does not become a law too soon.
The main objection that has been raised is that marital affairs are of a civil nature and the bill seeks to criminalise a civil matter. Now nothing can be farther from truth particularly when it comes to triple divorce. A casual look at the history of Muslim law would show that the act of triple talaq has always been considered a criminal act and Caliph Umar in whose time this practice acquired legal validity used to award a punishment of 400 lashes to a man who would resort to irrevocable or triple divorce.
The second criticism is that who will pay for the maintenance of the wife if the man is sent to jail. Surprisingly the criticism is being raised by those among whom there are many who were party to the passage of the Muslim Women Bill of 1986 that was brought to assuage the feelings of the personal law board, inflamed by the SC judgment in the Shah Bano case.
Then the personal law board had asserted that no Muslim husband has any liability to his divorced wife beyond iddat that is a period of three months after divorce, whereas section 125 of CrPC expanded this obligation to an unlimited period, particularly in cases where the ex-wife possessed no means to keep her body and soul together. The personal law board refused to accommodate even this indigent woman and asked the government to amend the existing criminal law and exclude Muslims from its ambit.
The government accepted their demand and brought a separate law whose stated purpose was to overturn the SC judgment in Shah Bano. One must not forget that till a few years later when the Supreme Court took a very liberal and pro woman view of this new law, the lower courts had turned down many petitions seeking relief under section 125 of CrPC on the ground that since the petitioners were Muslims, the relief under this section was no longer available to them.
So the question who will pay should be addressed to the personal law board as they still hold the same view as in 1986 and as late as last year they, through press articles, had expressed their dissatisfaction with the court rulings and had said that the judicial interpretation of the 1986 Act has resulted in sabotaging the gains of the Shah Bano agitation.
In May 2017, the personal law board had both orally and through an affidavit promised the Supreme Court that they would organise a campaign against triple divorce since it is an innovation, a sin and is highly unjust to women. Instead of doing what they had promised, they are now lobbying political support to ensure that those who according to them commit the ‘sin’ of ‘injustice’ by resorting to the ‘innovative’ triple divorce are not made accountable and the board may be given credit for having stalled the bill from becoming a law at least temporarily with the support of political parties who had stood by them in 1986.

Inciting violence destroys women’s rights","October 14, 2018, 8:03 PM  IST","TOI Edit","The bloodthirsty exhortation by Malayalam actor Kollam Thulasi to tear women visiting Sabarimala temple into two pieces, while speaking at a BJP-led protest, is plain incitement to violence against women. The gory imagery he conjured is reminiscent of the Taliban and its acts of spectacular cruelty towards women, calculated to drive them out of public spaces. Coming under flak for his remarks he has since issued a half-hearted apology, trotting out the familiar ‘hurt sentiments’ excuse.
The Supreme Court judgment allowing all women the right to worship at Sabarimala has fuelled massive protests across Kerala by Hindu groups opposing interference in religious traditions. They have every right to protest peacefully, a right protected by the Constitution. But when horrific violence is advocated a red line is crossed. BJP, an ardent advocate of ‘beti bachao beti padhao’ and the rights of Muslim women, cannot ignore the undisguised threat to Hindu women in Thulasi’s speech. BJP must maintain no truck with such elements given the strong correlation between hate speech and mob violence. At the receiving end of cultural intolerance in India are minorities, rationalists and women. Recall the assassinations of Narendra Dabholkar and Gauri Lankesh, or the lynchings based on gau raksha and child lifting rumours, or the murder of women branded as witches (NCRB records 134 such murders in India in 2016).
Mob attacks are often preceded by localised campaigns that openly incite violence. Only the state can counter them by using its statutory powers. But FIRs for hate speech are rarely prosecuted once the controversy dies down. Kerala government must emphasise that the actor is facing action for inciting violence, not for joining the protest.
The right to equality for women has moved rapidly in the judicial sphere from triple talaq abolition to Sabarimala entry and decriminalising adultery. PILs seeking entry of Muslim women to all mosques and the #MeToo outpouring by women against predatory men reveal a changing generation of women undeterred by societal sanctions and punishment. Women with clear conservative positions on traditions and legislation are also coming to the forefront, be it in the peaceful Sabarimala protests or the silent Maratha morchas. Men like Thulasi who incite misogyny and violence, however, are on a different platform. Even conservatives must isolate them.

     Till a few years ago, a man like Thulasi making such a statement would have attracted derision and ridicule, perhaps someone in need of psychiatric help. Today his words are laden with undisguised menace, for so many innocent lives have been lost to violence incited by provocateurs. The law of sedition is invoked so flippantly and so often, apply it in this case and let him fight for bail all the way up to the apex court....  Read More

Triple talaq, J&K, and now P Chidambaram. The J&K situation is volatile. Shah is tough, and in Satya Pal Malik, he has another tough man governing J&K. The PM just told Donald Trump that J&K is under control.
But truth be told, it is not. Shah & Co. will have to lift the restrictions soon. You just can’t clamp down seven million people under the barrel of a gun forever. There will be protests, Pakistan will fish in troubled waters. How to minimize these protests is the main challenge before Shah & Co.
Shah has just said that the politics of appeasement in India is over, which is a code word for Muslims not being appeased any further. But the Muslims (and the Hindus) of Kashmir need a healing balm just now, a balm that only Vajpayee could or now Modi can provide.
Kashmir’s mainstream politicians, the Abdullahs and the Syeds, will have to be placated and won over. The state can’t be a union territory forever, being governed by a macho man like Malik. There has to be a timeline when the state will regain its statehood, and when local leaders will get to rule the state.
Perhaps the PM needs to take over running the Kashmir policy himself, or if he’s too busy, then employ a man or a woman who can be both tough, but also employ the healing touch. Shah and Malik do not have neither the nous for Kashmir nor the healing touch.
On to Chidambaram. It was in his tenure as home minister that the PM was investigated by the special investigation team. The PM, as always, has learnt to live and let live. He didn’t do anything against PC in his first term. It was also during PC’s term as home minister that Shah was jailed, as an alleged encounter specialist.
Shah, as we know, doesn’t take insults lightly. But Shah takes umbrage at almost everything. The CBI sleuths who scaled the walls of PC’s house, wow. PV Sindhu has just brought home a gold for India. Maybe these sleuths can try their luck at the Olympics high jump.
PC is one of the most erudite, well-educated and capable persons in India. It was he that Sonia Gandhi entrusted the home ministry with right after 26/11. He did a superb job of it, stopping the panic that had spread all over India, and ensuring that such an attack was not repeated. Narendra Modi himself as Gujarat CM lauded the work that PC was doing. Arun Jaitley in a debate in Parliament said that a man of PC’s calibre was missing in the BJP and asked PC to switch over to the BJP.
Such a man is being treated as a common criminal. PC is a superb lawyer, and then he has a battery of superb lawyers like Kapil Sibal supporting him. That’s the thing that Advani, when he was home minister, got right about the BJP, that it just doesn’t have ministerial talent in its ranks.
The Congress, on the other hand, has always attracted the best talent like PC, Manmohan Singh and Shashi Tharoor. There is no shortage of ministerial talent in the ranks of the Congress. Shah will have a tough time nailing PC in the Supreme court.
What’s the next grenade that Shah is going to lob? The economy is on the skids. Nirmala Sitharaman is being accused of tax terrorism. Her enforcement directorate works hand in glove with Shah’s CBI to terrify the country’s industrialists. The calming voices of Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley are gone. The PM must ensure that Shah calms down. Or, else, if he continues to be hyperactive in the home ministry, shift him to a lesser job.

Ironic then that our own ugly wars are hurtling us to our doom. The most divisive issue is intermarriage, now a malignant obsession. One radical change could robustly alter our critical demography: 57,000, and shrinking by the day. But what chance does it have in today’s shrill orthodoxy and a disgracefully bickering leadership?
Magnanimous Parsi trusts are founded in the community’s rubric of social justice. Parsi industries instituted labour welfare long before it was mandated. But Parsi women, so seemingly liberated, are yet to sight the constitutional guarantee of gender justice, also at the heart of the triple talaq and shrine-entry issues. They are totally unequal in the emotive matter of intermarriage, which accounts for 37% of all marriages in a community already burdened by ‘never marrieds’. As many Parsi men as women choose partners from outside the fast-depleting pool. But a woman daring to do so is accused of sedition and heresy, because her ‘selfish’ act jeopardises community and religion. Her children are lost to both. Not so those of the intermarried Parsi male.
In 1909, Justices Beaman and Davar of the Bombay High Court went beyond ruling on the hotly opposed ‘conversion’ of R D Tata’s French bride. They appended a definition of ‘Parsi’, declaring that it applied to the descendants of the original band of Zoroastrian refugees, but only along the male line. This judicial zeal has denied all secular and sacred rights to the children of a Parsi woman married to a non-Parsi. They cannot be initiated into the Zoroastrian faith through the Navjote ceremony. This skew was inevitable in the unquestioned patriarchy of an earlier age, but it has actually worsened in the decades enlightened by gender equality. Trustees and priests have been aggressively — and whimsically — barring even these fully Parsi-Zoroastrian intermarried women from fire temples and traditional funeral rites.
What began in the courts has once again arrived there, and with it an opportunity to end this regressive discrimination. On April 21, the Supreme Court agreed to examine the special leave petition filed by Goolrookh Gupta, challenging the 2012 ruling of the Gujarat High Court that she ceased to be a Parsi Zoroastrian on account of her marriage to a non-Parsi, despite being married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and hence had no right to ask the Valsad Parsi Anjuman Trust to allow her to pray at the fire temple and, when necessary, to perform the funeral rites of her aged parents in the Tower of Silence.
The civil marriage law can be availed of by any Indian national anywhere, and does not require religion to be renounced by either party. Gupta challenged the proposition of the Gujarat HC that a wife automatically acquires the religion of her husband, stating that it amounted to the denial of the fundamental right to freely profess and practise one’s religion, a gender-neutral guarantee under Article 25. The Supreme Court will deliberate on Gupta’s petition in August.

A second case is potentially more cataclysmic. At safe distance from the obiter dicta of the Bombay Parsee Punchayet, Kolkata’s tiny but vibrant Parsi community has been, like Delhi’s, close but not closed. From here has risen a challenge to the fundamental 1909 judgment itself. The soft-spoken basketball player and homemaker, Prochy N Mehta is an unlikely firebrand, but the Calcutta High Court will hear in June an originating summons for interpreting the trust deed of the city’s only remaining fire temple. She had sought  permission for her grandchildren to enter it, a practice stopped by the new priest.

Their father is a Hindu Brahmin, but, in a joint show of defiance by three prominent Parsi families with intermarried daughters, all these  grandchildren had their Navjotes performed by progressive priests, and so are initiated Zoroastrians ( though  technically not Parsis). The Bombay Parsee Punchayet had squandered over Rs 2 crore in legal expenses trying to ‘defrock’ such ‘retrograde’ priests, who also provide the final grace of funeral prayers denied to the growing number opting for cremation.
Almost 30% of Parsi women remain unmarried largely because of this emotional blackmail. Accepting the children of intermarried Parsi women would replenish both community and faith in one go. But the strident orthodoxy plays on the paranoia over grubby fingers grabbing communal funds and coveted housing.

It is an existential choice. But a diluted gene pool has a logical case when a ‘pure’ one is increasingly non-viable. Parsis claim exclusive rights to Zoroastrianism, so making the ethnic sacrifice may again be the only way to save their ancient religion. Some 1,200 years ago, didn’t our forefathers bravely abandon their millennia-long Persian identity for just such a worthier cause?

     Sorry to burst everyoneâ  s bubble, but organized religion is man made. Also, as a Gujarati (from â  Hinduâ   family), my DNA has Persian/Parsi roots from an ancient ancestor. A professor once asked my sister if she was a Euroasian. Our family is from Baruch and history says that there was once a large community of Zoroastrians...you do the math; gotta love DNA...

"1616953154-87","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/11/?s=triple+talaq","What is the European culture war about?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/mind-the-gap/what-is-the-european-culture-war-about/","What is the European culture war about?","November 22, 2017, 12:02 PM  IST","Mrutyuanjai Mishra","When Indians read articles about India, whether written by Indians living abroad in internationally recognized newspapers of Western countries, or in reputed Indian newspapers, one gets the impression that Indian secularism is an exceptional cultural value, which has an absolute positive resonance in the West. But this distortion is only sustained to shame India, even though India gives enough rights to religious and linguistic minorities.
Secularism as perceived and practiced in India is very different from its counterpart in Western Europe. Indian lawmakers are still in the process of passing a law to stop the practice of triple talaq. A practice not acceptable even in some other Islamic countries.
While western newspapers and countries try to impose the regime of minority rights on colonized countries, the discourse on human rights in European countries, some of them being former colonial powers, has swiftly shifted from being minority-focused in the last 50 years to being what could be described as majority-focused. The wish and will of the majority is being listened to and considered legitimate and just.
So what is acceptable in a European country under the banner of secularization is not at the same as what is considered secular and sane in an Indian context. The rights of minorities seem to be an area of emphasis in many articles published on India, and whenever India is mentioned, a slight reference is often made to the state of religious and ethnic minorities.
Yet, if we observe the elections, whether in America or in Europe, political parties that focus on the perceptions of the majority are making it a cultural value to discuss the demand of the majority, and they are being rewarded. Without exception, each and every country in Western Europe is experiencing center-right parties or right-wing parties doing much better than a decade ago. The political middle ground is shifting swiftly towards the right and yet these election results are not characterized as being extreme.
Let us take the example of the Austrian People´s Party (ÖVP), which emerged as the largest party, making Sebastian Kurz, the leader of the party, the youngest head of government in Europe. Kurz had a clear-cut agenda of tightening the immigration laws and fighting political Islam. On top of that, the far-right party, FPÖ, received one fourth of the votes, making it a significantly large party, the third largest in Austria.
Take the instance of Brexit in UK, one of the reasons why so many voted for Brexit was that they saw it as a referendum on immigration and a way to express their dissatisfaction with the present immigration policies, which allowed workers from Eastern Europe to migrate to UK, putting pressure on the welfare state of the United Kingdom.
Let us look at the present political quagmire in Germany. It seems that the possibility of envisaging a “Jamaican” government seems utterly unfeasible. Despite the coalition negotiations between Merkel´s Christian Democrats (CDU), its sister party the CSU, the free democrats (FDP), and the Green Party seemed promising to start with, they have come to a stalemate. The opposition party, the Social democrats (SPD), which has traditionally been one of the biggest parties, is now lagging behind with an unprecedented low backing from voters.
So the present scenario is that most political parties want to be in opposition rather than be a coalition partner to Merkel´s Christian Democratic Party. The end result will automatically be a new election in Germany within a span of a few months. So how can we sum up these political tendencies?
Without an inch of doubt there is a cultural war taking place, and voters are demanding a society based on solidarity and a higher quality of welfare for all. A common citizen of any European country enjoys far more health and educational rights compared to an average citizen of America or Asia. Populism in Europe is about maintaining this broad-based system of universal rights, given to all, which means redistribution of wealth. This is unique to Europe, and the Europeans are revolting against the pressures of globalization in order to retain the good old system.
The Social Democrats, who have dominated the European continent for the last five decades, have been backsliding in polls and elections because they formed coalitions with parties that started reducing the welfare benefits in the name of reforms.
The cultural war in Europe is not similar to the one in USA or elsewhere. People want immigrants who are willing to pay high taxes and are willing to live up to the demands of integration, and learn linguistic skills in order to contribute to the sustainability of a universal welfare state.
‘Sammenhængskraft’(cohesion power) is the word in Scandinavia for a society based on the willingness to be part of the society. What does this mean? I can illustrate it with the fact that several times I have lost a wallet, a train card worth a lot of money, expensive gloves, etc., and whenever I have returned to the place where I had forgotten the item, some honest person had gone to the desk of the shop, office, or station and returned the lost property despite the fact that it was an easily usable and convertible element that could have been kept by the finder.
This honesty is a byproduct of the ‘sammenhængskraft’, which creates trust and honesty among citizens. There are islands in Denmark where people do not even lock their doors and have never done so. There is one policeman stationed. Such a society requires an enormously high amount of trust and faith in your fellow citizens.
The culture war in Europe is not about guns, it is not about the economic ideology of capitalism. It is a simple social urge to create a cohesive society where a poor and unintelligent person also enjoys certain inalienable rights.
In a recent lecture given in Copenhagen by the former French Ambassador of Human Rights, Francois Zimeray, who also happens to be the former French Ambassador to Denmark, he expressed the view that the Danes were more European than they realize. What was this idea of being European? Danes like their counterpart in European countries are not preoccupied about building the highest and the tallest buildings, they are not interested in creating the richest and the fanciest. European values are about moderation. Moderation which comes from creating a world where there is room for all.

Many Indians who identify as secular are fighting for a 15th century version of it","August 28, 2018, 6:54 PM  IST","Baijayant 'Jay' Panda","The attempt by Punjab’s governing party to legislate an anti-blasphemy law has attracted criticism, as a step backward from a modern, democratic, secular republic. This, just weeks after a prominent MP of the same party accused its opponents in the Union government of turning India “into a Hindu Pakistan”.
The irony, of course, is that Pakistan is among a handful of theistic states with strong anti-blasphemy laws. There lies the crux of India’s long running schism on secularism: even those who swear by it, have no compunction in blatantly flouting its basic tenets.
That is because the debate has long ago forsaken any rational discourse on ideas or principles, and simply become an “us vs them” exercise in virtue signalling. And, of course, consolidating votes.
To be fair, an anti-blasphemy law has existed in India since the charged atmosphere of Hindu-Muslim tensions in the 1920s, with punishment for “malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings”. And this new bill in Punjab, after a previous one against vandalising the Guru Granth Sahib was returned by the Union government last year, is “more secular” in that it criminalises vandalism against holy books of four religions.

Thus, this new draft of the bill comes closer to what has come to be the Indian version of secularism, as propagated by self-avowed secularists. This version exhorts the state to engage with and respect all religions’ practices.
But that is not exactly what secularism classically meant, and still means in most developed democracies, which is to treat religion strictly as a private matter and keep church and state separate. That is, the state ought not to have views on any religion’s beliefs and practices, and should be guided solely by constitutional tenets.
A key aspect of classical secularism was its co-development and strong linkage with classical liberalism. In contrast with what modern liberalism is increasingly morphing into, its classical origins emphasised not just secularism, but also freedom of speech and, crucially, the rights of individuals rather than those of the tribes, clans, groups or religions to which they belonged.
In moving away from classical secularism, like their global compatriots, many Indian liberals have also gradually compromised those two other linked principles. In fact, the 1920s anti-blasphemy law was incorporated by the Raj in reaction to a pamphlet critical of Islam’s prophet, leading in the 1950s to the “reasonable restrictions” clause on free speech.
Similarly, many liberals have shown themselves less committed to individual rights, even as they champion the rights of disenfranchised groups, such as caste or religious minorities.  Of course, championing the rights of groups facing discrimination is laudable. Where it is less so, is when the rights of individuals within those groups are treated as subservient to group rights. That also violates the Constitution, which grants equal rights to each individual citizen.
The textbook example of this dichotomy is on the issue of triple talaq. Many of the same activists who take up cudgels against discrimination faced by Muslims, and discrimination faced by women, nevertheless falter when it comes to the individual constitutional rights of women who happen to be Muslim.
The problem with what passes for secularism in India is that it brings discretion and interpretation into the equation. Why, for instance, are Hindu temples administered by the government when all other religious communities manage their own places of worship? And, if the Punjab bill becomes law, will vandalising holy books beyond the four listed in it not be criminal? What if you or I founded a new religion and wrote new holy books, as we are entitled to by the Constitution?
Ultimately, to be truly secular, a modern democracy has no real alternative to keeping the state out of religion. Otherwise, it must settle for an earlier, lesser standard of secularism as practised in, say, the Ottoman empire. There, the state religion was Islam but minorities were tolerated and enjoyed certain protections. They were even allowed their own laws within their communities, unless conflicts spilled over beyond their neighbourhoods. But there was no question of all its citizens enjoying equal protection under the law.
Indian secularism is caught in a bind.  On the one hand, our Constitution supports the modern standard for it. And is backed by millennia of secular culture, such as the religious freedoms guaranteed by emperor Ashoka. Yet many Indians who identify as secular are fighting for a 15th century version of it, not a 21st century one.
From the Constituent Assembly to the Supreme Court, this tussle has gone to extremes. The SC has ruled that practices “essential” to a religion are constitutionally protected, and has even gone into assessing which controversial religious practices are essential.
Frankly, it is bizarre for constitutional judges to act as arbiters of religious authenticity. Where religious practices violate constitutional guarantees to individuals, secular states should unhesitatingly side with the latter, as for example the US Supreme Court did in overruling religious objections to vaccinations.
India faces similar tests. In one case being heard now, Justice Chandrachud has said “SC judges are now assuming a theological mantle, which we are not expected to… The test should be whether a practice subscribes to the Constitution, irrespective of whether it is essential (to a religion) or not.” Exactly.

In Parliament, the opposition raised college debate-level points over procedures and committees while the government moved swiftly to pass the triple talaq bill and the momentous abrogation of Article 370 with clinical despatch.
The voiding of Article 370 is a breakthrough moment not just because the Modi government broke the numerical barrier in Rajya Sabha, but for the ideological fracturing it caused in the opposition ranks as regional parties like the BJD, BSP, TRS, YSR-CP and even the TDP saw a popular support for the move that trumped usual concerns about alienating minority votes and provincial autonomy.
In his first term, Modi provided sufficient evidence that he is a risk-taker who will not shy from taking tough decisions. Determined to use his parliamentary majority to the fullest, he put his political capital on the line on demonetisation and the GST rollout. He moved decisively — though not rashly — to confront Pakistan after a suicide bomber killed 40 troopers in Pulwama. And he did not flinch in using Aadhaar to launch ambitious social welfare schemes in the face of political and legal challenges.
Ahead of the vote on Article 370 and the audacious move to split Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh into separate Union Territories, the home ministry under Amit Shah poured thousands of troops into the state while strategic defections in Parliament demoralised Congress thoroughly. The adroit use of Article 370 itself, which allowed the government to evade the necessity of a two-third vote for a constitutional amendment, fell in the realm of stratagem. But Article 370 defied conventional solutions.
Concerns over parliamentary procedure, lack of discussion with “stake-holders” (a deliciously important-sounding but vague term), misgivings over a compact being betrayed do not answer the question — did Article 370 and the separate status it promised work? Are things better today than in 1950 when it became part of India’s new Constitution? The truth is the goal of safeguarding the identity and rights of J&K has been long subverted by separatism and alienation and the political cause overtaken by the force of global jihad. The conventional political leadership in the Valley is incapable of speaking up against —leave alone resisting — the tide of radicalisation. The PDP and National Conference campaign on the stone-pelters’ platform, and have no positive message to offer. They can do little as ISIS flags are unfurled at mosques and radicalised school teachers put their students in harm’s way, egging them to throw stones at security convoys. Conventional comparisons of development parameters are meaningless in a state where 70% of revenue comes from central transfers (50% as grants-in-aid).
The special status of Article 370 and Article 35A that allows the state assembly to define permanent residents created a false sense of privilege in the Valley and kept alive an insidious aspect of the two-nation theory in India’s only Muslim-majority state. It provided foreign busybodies just the opening to push for “internationalisation” of the Kashmir dispute. Just as the line of control, lacking the sanctity of an international border, keeps a territorial dispute festering, Article 370 created a constitutional ambiguity and set Kashmir apart from the rest of India.
In all the decades since Independence, voices that called for peace and reconciliation in Kashmir have been silenced by the gun. Hizbul leaders who broke away were executed, journalists who dallied with separatists paid with their lives and religious figures who contemplated reconciliation have been assassinated. With Pakistan’s madrassas churning out terror recruits by the hundred, it is only Indian Army that stands between Kashmir’s towns becoming versions of Raqqa and Mosul under IS occupation.
Article 370 was a cancer that fed on J&K and brutalised everyone. A relentless spiral of violence numbed the national mind while trapping the local population between terrorists and security pickets. In this crushing reality, truth was the casualty and every narrative an escape from the present.
Just before the strike on Article 370, India’s commentariat occupied itself with cautionary tales on the economy. Indeed, fixing growth and investment remain an urgent task for Modi. But secure borders and internal peace are the best pills for sustained economic growth. Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have the chance to work out a better and more equitable future. Article 370 was a worn-out bargain well past its use-by date.

     You are right. Article 370 has only produced violence, corruption and backwardness. It has also given handle to Pakistan to interfere. It has also become an issue while dealing with other Islamic countries.Those who expect Muslims to take up arms or join ISIS or other Jihadis will prove wrong....

Was it, as the brigade of the superior feels, a classic case of the media pandering to the base voyeuristic instincts of the great unwashed? Or, was it a contrived and cynical controversy that led to free publicity for two individuals, much to the embarrassment of two respectable families?
There is virtue in both assertions. The aam janata are conditioned to equate the private lives of celebrities with public interest and Sania was a star whose glamour quotient equalled Bollywood and cricketing greats. Her decision to marry Shoaib was governed by personal choice, but it didn’t distract from a widespread perception that the groom was unworthy of the iconic Hyderabad girl. It was this undercurrent of disapproval for the interloper, also seen as a habitual predator, which fuelled gory interest in the charges of duplicity levelled by the proverbial ‘other woman’. In the dogfight of reputations, Shoaib emerged as the clear loser and this ignominy may, unfortunately, rub off on his fiancé.
Yet, there was more to the filmi melodrama played out in Hyderabad than mere salacious titillation. The relationship of Shoaib and Ayesha Siddiqui has raised disturbing questions that centre on the cavalier misuse and manipulation of the laws and institutions governing the family.
A marriage is governed by well-defined laws or social and religious customs. That Shoaib could persistently deny the fact that the nikahnama involving him and Ayesha was valid suggests that there is a huge grey area surrounding non-codified practices. In Pakistan, a marriage has to be registered — which this nikahnama was not — to be valid, while there is as yet no obligation to do the same in India. Second, the nikah was conducted over telephone, an unusual practice that Shoaib seized upon to contest the reality of the marriage to Ayesha. Indeed, had it not been for some telltale archival TV footage, the threat of non-bailable arrest under the draconian Section 498(a) of the Indian Penal Code and the intervention of community elders, the cricketer may have raised the pitch, claimed harassment and turned the whole incident into an emotive but ugly Indo-Pak spat.
Yet, Shoaib’s grudging admission of his marriage to Ayesha has in turn raised awkward questions. The elders in India upheld the legitimacy of an unregistered nikahnama contracted in Pakistan, where registration is obligatory. More to the point, they upheld a telephonic nikah — something clearly not anticipated in the religious texts. In the process they have opened the floodgates of dodgy, long-distance marriages where the bride and groom don’t even have to be physically present. The scope for misuse is profound and equal in scale to the fixed-term muta marriages that are a cover for prostitution.
The disturbing implications of the Shoaib-Ayesha marriage don’t stop here. The talaqnama negotiated between Shoaib and the Siddiqui family may have freed Ayesha from the unenviable status of a deserted wife and put an end to all criminal proceedings but the speed with which it was concluded is ominous. It suggests that the prescribed waiting period between the first two talaqs and the final divorce is largely illusory and can be circumvented according to convenience. In view of earlier rulings by Indian Muslim clerics that a peremptory triple talaq is valid even if the husband is either drunk or in a rage, the sanctioned fast-track divorce of a celebrity is certain to become a precedent, just as the telephone talaq by Chand Mohammed to Fiza in Chandigarh last year gave ideas to many.
It may interest Indians to note that Shoaib wouldn’t have been able to secure such a speedy divorce in Islamic Pakistan. Ayub Khan’s Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961, set out a 90-day timetable, including written notice and a formal hearing by an Arbitration Council, as the procedure for divorce. Even polygamy, a step Shoaib implicitly contemplated, involves cumbersome procedures in Pakistan, the violation of which could lead to imprisonment; in India, he could have had up to four wives quite casually.
Untainted by Zia-ul Haq’s subsequent tweaking and some perverse court judgments, Pakistan has relatively more equitable laws governing Muslim marriages and divorce. In India, as the Shoaib-Ayesha tangle has so vividly demonstrated, Muslim personal laws are an unregulated open market, prone to arbitrariness, theological hair-splitting, expediency and social pressures. The shifts in social consciousness and perceptions of justice that have accompanied economic growth, women’s empowerment and globalization are insufficiently reflected in India’s patchy Anglo-Mohammedan law.
The bizarre Shoaib-Ayesha face-off was a legal farce and a national disgrace. In its elusive quest for a consensus, India can’t afford to shelve personal law reform indefinitely.

Few questions matter more to the country’s future. Yet the odds of either major national party coming up with a sensible answer appear vanishingly small.
In a sense, Indian politics illustrates a larger global issue. As the Pakistani-Canadian atheist Ali Amjad Rizvi puts it, “The left is wrong on Islam. The right is wrong on Muslims.” I would phrase it differently in an Indian context: “Congress is wrong on Islam. BJP is wrong on Muslims.”
Let’s start with Congress, whose electoral woes can be traced, at least in part, to its having lost the confidence of a large chunk of India’s Hindu majority. Traditionally, Congress has been soft on Islamism, the attempt to order society by the religious rules laid down in sharia law. In the 1950s, Jawaharlal Nehru piloted deep reforms in Hindu society including the abolition of untouchability, the prohibition of polygamy and full property rights for widows. But Nehru baulked at extending the same modernising principle to Islamic law.
At the time, this oversight was somewhat explicable. In 1951, India housed only 35 million Muslims, or about 10% of the country’s population. A community shaken by Partition required reassurance that independent India would treat it humanely. Across the Muslim world, secularists appeared ascendant. Many scholars believed that it was only a matter of time before the regressive practices enshrined in sharia withered away. The rise of Islamist terrorism as a global concern was still decades away.
At the same time, however, the Congress approach to Muslims included a streak of cynical vote grubbing. Before Independence, the party’s position on Partition was aligned with Islamist groups, albeit for different reasons. (For instance, Jamaat-e-Islami founder Abul Ala Maududi opposed the creation of Pakistan out of a belief that all of India belonged to Islam). After 1947, Congress continued to truck with Islamists of various stripes. It effectively gave the Muslim community’s most orthodox elements a veto over progress.
This approach reached its nadir in 1986. That year Rajiv Gandhi rammed through a law to negate a Supreme Court judgment granting alimony to a 70-year-old Muslim divorcee named Shah Bano. Arguably no single act damaged Congress’s credibility with the Hindu middle class more than this naked pandering to retrograde sentiment. Two years later, India became the first country in the world to ban Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses.
Over the years, the Congress habit of kowtowing to radicals has deepened to the point of parody. In 2010 party general secretary Digvijaya Singh helped launch a book that claimed that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh masterminded the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Last year, a video emerged showing Singh praising the hardline Wahhabi televangelist Zakir Naik, whose extreme views have led the United Kingdom and Canada to bar him from visiting.
Some of the party’s blunders can be traced to its hapless efforts to regain power in Uttar Pradesh. In 2012 then law minister Salman Khurshid claimed at an Azamgarh campaign rally that Sonia Gandhi had teared up over an encounter in Delhi’s Batla House with Indian Mujahideen terrorists. The party’s prominent candidates in this year’s state elections included Imran “Boti-Boti” Masood, who once threatened to chop Narendra Modi to pieces.
Nobody can accuse BJP of being soft on Islamism. The Supreme Court deserves credit for outlawing instant triple talaq, but the prime minister should nonetheless be applauded for publicly backing the brave Muslim women who waged a long and lonely legal battle against the practice. Among major Indian parties, only BJP unambiguously backs a uniform civil code.
The trouble with India’s ruling party is not that it opposes Islamism, but that its actions suggest a deep-rooted hostility towards Muslims. Take, for instance, the appointment in March of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Not long ago, Adityanath’s strident anti-Muslim rhetoric, and the violence associated with the militia he founded, Hindu Yuva Vahini, would have made him unfit for even a junior minister’s position in Delhi. Now he presides over a state with roughly as many people as Brazil.
Or take BJP’s obsession with restricting the beef industry (in India mostly buffalo), which employs Muslims in disproportionately large numbers. In a country with relatively few new employment opportunities, it takes a special brand of callousness to hurt the livelihoods of some of your poorest citizens merely because they happen not to share your religious taboos.
Or consider representation. The Modi government does not count a single Muslim in the Cabinet. It counts only two Muslims in the entire council of ministers. It’s almost as though the party thinks it can wish away more than one-eighth of India’s population the way some brilliant historians can wish away the fact that Akbar defeated Rana Pratap at the battle of Haldighati.
For an Indian secularist, the choices are bleak. The party that welcomes Muslims as fellow Indians also panders to Islamists. The party that opposes Islamists also makes many ordinary Muslims feel insecure. Neither party appears capable of a simple enough task – battling Islamists while embracing ordinary Muslims.

     Why are we denying the obvious. 180 million Muslims and increasing  cannot and should not be wished away. Only a positive and proactive approach will do. It is a challenge that must be taken up. 10 percent of Indian Muslims are covertly and overtly anti - Indian, pro -Pakistan and Jihadists, 5 percent are avowedly pro-Indian and the remainder simply want to get on with their lives only if their politicians and mullahs would allow them. There is a catch somewhere. Only an inclusive no nonsense approach will do. Let there be no doubt that Indian Muslims are a hardworking people. This asset can well be exploited for overall good....

Since then, he has been in and out of political parties, including BJP. Soon after Parliament passed a bill to criminalise triple talaq, Pratigyan Das caught up with him to talk about the subject:
What is your take on the legislation criminalising triple talaq?
We need to understand that Islamic jurisprudence makes distinction between divorces, which is described as most odious among permissible things. It only becomes final after following a procedure which takes at least three months. Instant divorce which is three pronouncements of divorce in one sitting becomes irrevocable immediately. The former is a civil matter whereas the latter has always been considered an act that is ‘bidat’ (innovative malpractice) and sinful. In Islamic jurisprudence, any act that is held to be ‘haram’ (prohibited) is always punishable. An act to be civil must be a civilised act and triple talaq was always held to be a criminal act. Mind you in the first case of triple talaq, Caliph Umar had ordered the offender to be flogged publicly.
Supreme Court had already declared triple talaq invalid. Was criminalisation then necessary?
Let us not forget that despite the judgment, the cases of triple talaq happened continuously. To add insult to injury, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) publicly asserted that that practice is permissible and shall continue notwithstanding the judgments of the courts. They were openly inciting people to indulge in an unlawful act. More than 345 cases happened during the first three months after the judgment. We have another example. The Constitution of India abolished untouchability in 1949 but decades later we realised that the constitutional provision on its own could not eradicate the evil and then laws were passed to make the practice a punishable offence.
Would the exploited women have been better served by using Indian Penal Code (IPC)?
Under which provision of IPC and if we go for IPC that too would be an action under the criminal law.
Congress says it’s discriminatory because no other religion in the country was being threatened with jail terms for irregular divorce practices.
They should have displayed this sense of fair play when they had robbed Shah Bano, an old destitute Muslim woman, of Rs 174.20 per month which the court had awarded her under the provision of CrPC and not under any civil law. Even today if they want to have equality of laws then they should persuade the AIMPLB to agree to a uniform civil code (UCC) – all these complexities would disappear and all citizens of India shall have same rights and same obligations.
What’s your view on a UCC?
UCC is mandated by Article 44 of our Constitution. Since it is not justiciable and is part of the directive principles, it is obligatory on the part of the state to take steps to create an environment conducive to the enactment of UCC as early as possible.
How do you react to the comparisons that are being drawn between Sabarimala and triple talaq?
I have personally supported women who wish to enter the temple and I believe in this age, discrimination based on gender cannot be allowed. But these two issues are totally different. Sabarimala is a question of asserting a democratic and religious right. On the other hand, triple divorce is an enormity which robs Muslim women of their dignity and is an instrument of oppression and torture which must go away at the earliest. No Muslim society anywhere in the world now permits it. The Indian Muslim male is not a special creature that needs to be armed with this arbitrary right which has caused unspeakable damage to so many families and children.
There are also allegations that minorities, especially Muslims, are feeling insecure in India. Your views?
Historically speaking, some individuals always project their own fears and insecurities as the fears and insecurities of whole communities. Before 1947, Muslim League claimed to articulate these fears on behalf of all Muslims and when they got away with Pakistan the Muslims who went over with them were not even half of the total Muslim population. In 1986, Muslim clergy became fearful of the Supreme Court and organised an extremely aggressive movement to defend their ‘community identity’ which they said was under threat due to judgments of the SC. Now it is BJP government. They do not realise that this nursing of grievances and fears robs the people of their self-confidence. The sense of victimhood that they are creating is extremely injurious to the healthy growth of people. There is an Arabic proverb which says that ‘ignorance leads to enmity, enmity to fear and fear to violence.’ And I would reiterate that.

     All these secular idiots need to understand one thing. In 1947, at the time of partition, India was left with 95% Hindus. No one begged for secularism. It was imposed on them. THIS IS THE GREATEST FRAUD on humanity. Islam is not a religion. It is a way of life best suited for desert nomads. Islam by itself is not wrong or sin.. But the misintrepretation by tehse naqli muslims who embraced islamc for petty material gains has done a great damage to that religion - labelling it as terror religion., Islam does not want tehse naqli converts. They must die so that ISLAM gains its original glory...  Read More

My intention is to show, how mainstream religious beliefs are legalized in the west contrary to what many in India, especially Kerala think. Another reason which prompted me is that in the Sabarimala verdict, Justice Deepak Mishra was quoting Susan B Anthony and Henry Ward (a Christian Reformer), while Justice Chandrachud referred to “Pursuit of Happiness”.
1) Masterpiece Cakeshop Vs Colorado Civil Rights Commission
A bakery owner, Jack Philips refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple, as he considered their union was against his Christian beliefs. The gay couple with the help of Colorado civil rights commission went to court against him. In court, he cited his beliefs as a Christian, and won the case. In July 2018, the US Supreme court held that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed hostility toward the baker based on his religious beliefs.
Religious Tolerance vs Hostility
Three years ago, in 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in the US. That opinion was written by Justice Kennedy. But in the baker’s case, the same justice wrote that there is room for religious tolerance, and pointed out that the Civil rights commission had mistreated Philips by downplaying his religious liberty concerns. Justice Kennedy wrote, “At the same time the religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.”
“The commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion. These disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market” Kennedy said.
Comparison to Kerala situation


While writing this, I couldn’t help think that, no one with a tiny bit of empathy and human emotion left in them, can deny the huge hostility displayed and encouraged by the local government under the pretext of obeying court (towards something millions hold as a sacred and harmless tradition in one specific Temple of a beloved pilgrimage, which doesn’t affect anyone’s social life, which was misrepresented by the government itself in the court as a case of gender equality, and a case which is still in court) misusing all of Kerala government machinery and funds, to trample and mock religious liberty.
Further, with the “wall” they really sought to build in minds, some simpletons and some really, really righteous people may have been able to be convinced that this is about gender equality, but surely there can be no denial that they provided an open platform/wall for many people to exhibit their religious hate and bigotry under a liberal garb. I don’t think that is what the Indian Supreme Court ordered.
To further contextualize, in America, even though same-sex marriage is legalized and no one should be discriminatory to them in social life, the government cannot force a church or any religious organization/person to officiate the marriage, or not even force a bakery to bake a cake for them.
Global Catholic Network Vs Obamacare
Obamacare required employers to cover a wide range of contraceptives, in their employee health care plans. They exempted churches and religious orders; but NGOs like “Little Sisters of the Poor”, run by nuns & EWTN Global Catholic Network went to court against it. They said, “Catholic teaching on contraception and abortion is no secret, so it should have come as no surprise that we rejected the mandate.” In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Little Sisters and asked the government to work out schemes to leave such organizations out of the process. In November 2018, EWTN won in a separate federal appeals court.
Comparison to Kerala Situation


US government and US media treated the case with religious sensitivity. I don’t think anyone in the government or media thought they were responsible for “reforming” Catholics or bringing in a new “renaissance” by “rewriting” Catholic beliefs, unlike what the Kerala government did to the Hindu temple. Never did I hear any defamatory statement from government or media regarding nun’s habits or such NGO’s interests/biblical beliefs in contraception/reproduction, much different from the treatment given to Sabarimala temple officials/believers.
I don’t think the US cases are even comparable to the Sabarimala temple issue in that, they do affect tons of people’s active social lives, while the Sabarimala pilgrimage does not. None of the US cases even involved churches which were already completely exempted. No western government or court is interfering in any church sect’s freedom in deciding which other Christian sect people they will/won’t give communion to. No liberal or government is comparing this to the racial segregation which existed in churches. No court or government will examine or insist on biblical or other religion’s verses to be removed to bring gender equality on central tenets, or why women cover their heads in churches or otherwise. Western media had reported that Meghan Markle, a renowned feminist, was required to be baptized into Church of England before the Royal wedding, as she was probably baptized in a different sect & wasn’t eligible to receive Church of England’s communion. I feel that in a world, where all of this is totally normalized, a harmless tradition and temple which affects no social lives, worshipped by millions, is denigrated so much through state machinery & words in 2018 is unbelievable. For a Hindu, a temple and its beliefs are as sacred as a bible to a Christian.
Justice Kurien Joseph’s opinion
I am hoping that on Jan 22, Indian Supreme Court would really consider the utter religious insensitivity and hostility towards the Hindu temple, that was displayed in Kerala under the garb of implementing their verdict. I am also hoping that this verdict would go through the judicial methods suggested by Justice Kurien Joseph, namely “Review petitions, and if required, Curative petitions and a government ordinance”. He said, ”This is a case still in court.” “Court always has an open attitude. If things are presented the correct way, courts will always consider it with an open attitude.” He adds, “Judges who decide such cases should have at least an inkling of India’s wide diversity.” Also says “There have been many verdicts which were not implemented”.
When asked if his stand is contradictory as he is the architect of Triple Talaq verdict, he replied that TT verdict was a very safe one as it was done by completely respecting Koran and Shariat. (What he implies is that, only INSTANT TT/Talaq-e-Biddat (which could even be done on phone or WhatsApp) which is disapproved in the scripture is banned by the verdict. Talaq-e-Hasan through which triple talaq can be done in 2 months (end of 3 menstrual cycles) remains untouched in India. Also, Talaq-e- Ahsan involving 3 months is untouched. No alimony need to be paid either). I have no locus standing on this and Court would throw me out if I express the opinion, but ‘wall makers’ seem content with this, while continuing to be worried about equal trekking rights !!
When questioned as to whether his stand is because he is a known believer in God, he replies, “More than that, it is because I am completely aware of the constitutional protection and complete freedom that my own religion enjoys in India and in its constitution. Such a constitution which provides such open freedom of all religions is very rare in the world.”
It can be safely surmised that had he been retained in the bench, he would have voted same as Justice Indu Malhotra. He even says, “I had expressed my views strongly when I was involved in the case.”
We know that Article 25 and 26 provide all freedom and respect to India’s minority religions and sects. I hope this will ring true for native religion and sacred temples also on Jan 22nd.


Here is my analysis on Justice Indu Malhotra’s verdict which I had previously put on FB

Bhadreswar, Bhagabanpur, Chanchol, Chandannagar, Dhulagarh, Hajinagar, Jalangi, Jamuria, Kaliachowk, Kanchrapara, Kansa, Katwa, Kharagpur, Sankrail and now Baduria and Basirhat. The list can no longer be read in one breath. Those who have the intent to revise the writing on the wall will know that the stage is set for more blood.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee must realise that the communal malaise has hit the body politic of West Bengal. It can no longer be expected to die out and therefore be prevented via wait-and-watch manoeuvres. The state needs an earnest roadmap to cure the disease and establish functional relations between Hindus and Muslims. Here are six measures to achieve the purpose – two long-term and four immediate.
First, Bengal must allow the emergence of a civil society among Muslims. It is telling that most ‘leaders’ of the community in secular India continue to be related to the mosque in some way. Worse, many of these cleric-leaders have only brought shame upon the community in Bengal. The likes of Syed Quaderi and Noor Barkati who put up public rewards to humiliate Sonu Nigam and Narendra Modi cannot lead a community; especially when it has produced the likes of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah and poet Nazrul Islam.
Muslim traders have played a significant role in the recent ouster of Noor Barkati as imam. Media personality Mir Ali and rock musician Rupam Islam are hugely popular across West Bengal. Yet when the former was criticised by radical Muslims for celebrating Christmas, the Bengali secularati decided to remain mum. From the Left Front’s acceptance of extremist demands against Taslima Nasreen to the TMC’s sabotage of Salman Rushdie; the Bengali secularati has ensured that Muslim commons remain political clients of its grandstanding.
Second, Muslim civil society cannot rise if the community fails to embrace secular education. Hindu ‘pathshalas’ have almost disappeared. Without secular education there is little scope to participate in a globalised economy – a social mobility route which scheduled castes have used very successfully.
Muslim masses must realise that the political combination of secular brigade and mosque men have done them zero favour by keeping minority institutions out of the purview of state inspection in Bengal. The plight of madrasa headmaster Masum Akhtar, who was beaten up by the clergy for teaching students the national anthem, is a dangerous indicator of what transpires in those opaque premises. Bengali Muslims must pressurise Mamata Banerjee for schools and not for the presence of TMC leaders in public assemblies that demand the continuation of medieval practices like triple talaq.
Third, Muslim appeasement must stop. The Calcutta high court made this dire observation in October 2016: “There has been a clear endeavour on the part of the state government to pamper and appease the minority section of the public at the cost of the majority section without there being any plausible justification.” Mamata must admit that her pamper tactics to consolidate Muslim votes have come at a terrible cost for the state. Thanks to TMC, Bengal’s proud record in communal harmony is at great risk.
Fourth, the Hindu population under threat should recognise that the BJP upsurge in the state will not stop at protection from a minority bully. It will translate into the politics of vendetta, if not methodically then sporadically. This is sure to result in human tragedies that spin out of control very quickly. History is witness to the intensity of communal riots in the east. The unparalleled devastation had compelled Gandhi to shun any celebration and fast in erstwhile Calcutta on the very day of Independence.
Overzealous assertion by Hindus, which BJP can well organise, will further reduce chances of investment in the industry-denied state. So, support to BJP should be based on the pact that defence of the majority will not entail attack on the minority.
Fifth, the eastern border has to be sealed. Congress and leftists dilly-dallied on border control in the east. The profitable negligence gave them a faithful ‘electorate’ of illegal migrants in Assam and Bengal. It altered demographics along the 4,000 km border of which almost 1,500 km lies in Bengal. Most riot-hit areas today fall in the border districts of Malda, Murshidabad, North 24 Parganas and adjoining Bardhaman, Hoogly, Howrah.
The continued influx of Muslim migrants from a volatile Bangladesh is a burden not only on prospective harmony but on Bengal’s tattered economy as well. Sincerity to secure the porous border with men and machines will indicate BJP’s seriousness about peace and prosperity in the state.
Sixth, Mamata has summoned her innovative Didigiri to institute a programme that may prove effective. She has planned the formation of a ‘peacekeeping force’ in every neighbourhood to tackle the daily spate of communal unrest. It will constitute civilians from different walks of life. They will assist the police in dealing with Hindu-Muslim flare-ups.
The ethnographic film Naata (2003) demonstrates how community initiatives can contribute to the restoration of communal peace. Such enterprise establishes channels of communication between alienated groups. Mistrust and fear – prerequisites for communal violence – thrive in such atmosphere and must be checked.
These measures will not only ensure functional coexistence of Hindus and Muslims but also uplift the latter from the dangerous quagmire of backwardness and discontent. The need of the hour is civic dynamism and political will at the levels of the state and Centre to translate obvious theory into rigorous practice.

In a clash between temporal law and religious custom, what should prevail? Indisputably, custom should defer to the law of the land. This has happened, in the past, in the case of egregious customs, such as the widow being burnedon the funeral pyre of her dead husband and untouchability based on caste. Custom has been ruled invalid in the case of triple talaq. In the case of women’s entry into the Sabarimala temple, too, custom has been overruled — except that it was not really the custom to ban women of menstrual age from the temple. Women were allowed except during special seasons. The total ban was the result of a Kerala High Court order in 1991, not of any age-old temple custom. The unfortunate part is that the irrationality of the notion of menstruating women being held impure — the ‘physiological’ reason cited in the Kerala High Court order — and being banned from temples has not been subjected to societal interrogation in the light of evolving medical and social attitudes; instead, it has been settled by judicial intervention.
There is a legitimate space of social and religious reform through debate and striving for change by the faithful that has not been used in the present case. Real progress is often impeded by backlash to reform imposed from above.

     How can you compare Sati to this.. Sati causes loss of life.. Untouchability is inhumane... And triple Talaq ruins a person's life as its related to marriage.It's a temples custom.it has to be respected. Just like how we take a bath or go bare feet in a temple. Not allowing women does not cause any loss of life to anyone.. First of all the government has to concentrate on issues which lead to loss of life....  Read More

In which case, can the Islamic practice of triple talaq – by which a man can divorce his wife simply by repeating the word talaq three times in front of witnesses – seek sanction for itself under the right of freedom of religion guaranteed by the Indian Constitution?
That is the question facing the government, and civil society at large, after the Supreme Court sought the views of the NDA administration on the subject.
The custom of triple talaq has been challenged, on the grounds of gender bias,  in the apex court by organizations representing Muslim women. Triple talaq has long been a contentious issue.  Several Muslim organizations have argued that the custom is a matter of religious faith and as such is non-judicial in a secular court of law.  However, the BJP-led government has now argued that triple talaq can, in fact, be regulated – in other words legally disallowed – as it is not a central tenet of Islam and at the same time is discriminatory to women, and in violation of the constitutional right to equality.
Indeed, triple talaq is disallowed in a number of Islamic countries, and it is anomalous that it should have legal sanction in a secular polity as India supposedly is.
The BJP-led government is treading cautiously on the matter as the saffron party has long espoused the need for a common civil code, a move opposed not only by members of the Muslim community but also by many secular liberals who believe that to enforce such uniformity would be discriminatory against minority communities and transgress their right to religious freedom.
However, while making it clear that its stand on triple talaq is not a first step towards implementing a common civil code, a government spokesperson has been quoted as saying: “Right to profess one’s faith is protected under the Constitution.  But practice needs to be segregated from faith.  Practices that are not fair can be regulated under the secular law.”
The question of religious practice and the constitutional right to equality has been a thorny issue, made more so by the controversial Shah Bano case during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure, an instance which is often cited as blatant evidence of minority appeasement and vote-catching despite being patently discriminatory against women.
The question is simple: Is triple talaq central to Islam?  Can one be a faithfully observant Muslim without having recourse to this gender-biased practice?
Many Muslims and non-Muslims of both genders would agree that doing away with triple talaq  is not anti-Islamic.
It’s high time the supposedly secular Indian state officially divorced itself from triple talaq, a practice as gender violative in its own way as the custom of Sati was.

     the second issue sc is delibrating on is polygamy (max four marriges by a male). this is also against gender equality. so sc in my opinion should give judgement against triple talaq ( allow women equally to give talaq), and set aprocedure for talaq through the judicial systemor to start with aquasi judicial system,in which women should be also represented equally. sc should also give judgement against polygamy,as it is not necessary to have more then one wife,in islam. and in all other countries where muslims are not in majority but they are citizens after migration of by birth,  ,like in us and eu they are following the countries law of monogamy. this country is not an islamic country, the division took place on the basis of religion in 1947, so people who do not want to follow secular ,gender equality ,and forward looking laws are very much free to migrate to islamic countries, or they have to follow secular gender euality as enshriened in the constitution. the anamoly is existing and was encouraged by shahbano case which requres correction towards a just nation. yes the question of uniform civil code will be the next logical step. for the people of this nation to live in harmony and intermingaling ,and not in seperate ghettos, suspecting each others motives towards each other ,common civil code is a much much desirable and needed reform.  ....

Stating a position that is completely out of sync with modern democratic values, AIMPLB asserted that Sharia grants right of divorce to husbands through triple talaq as they have greater power of decision making compared to wives. The august body’s assertion indicates that it is at least two centuries behind the times. Since the 20th century onwards, it has become outmoded to treat women as lesser mortals.
That the affidavit was filed in response to petitions by Muslim women activists who have asked the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional shows one can no longer presume AIMPLB speaks for the entire Muslim community. Muslim women in India have suffered because of triple talaq where arbitrary divorces declared over postcards or telegrams have been sustained. AIMPLB’s argument that a Muslim man can delegate his power of pronouncing talaq to his wife is laughable – this can hardly be expected to happen in real life if the wife wants a divorce but husband doesn’t.
AIMPLB’s case for polygamy is equally bizarre. It has actually stated that the practice of a Muslim man being allowed to have up to four wives stems from concern and sympathy for women. It has argued that in a situation where women outnumber men, banning polygamy will force women into leading a spinster’s life. The formulation is absurd since the sex ratio for the Indian Muslim community stands at 951 females per 1,000 males. If AIMPLB is to be logically consistent, it should actually advocate allowing Muslim women to have more than one husband.
The truth is Muslim personal laws – like other religious laws – flow from patriarchy and relegate women to second class status. Notably, several Islamic countries prohibit these practices. Triple talaq has been banned in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Polygamy is prohibited in countries like Turkey and Turkmenistan. Moreover, in a secular democracy religious laws cannot trump the constitutional right to equality. Given that Hindu personal laws have evolved to empower Hindu women, there’s no reason why Muslim women have to suffer from patriarchal religious practices. Triple talaq and polygamy fail the test of Indian constitutionality.

     nowadays people are discussing this topics quiet frequently, this is completely due to lack of islamic knowledge and teaching towards each and every individual, here is my proposal to read and consider this may be a solution, make an islamic education board, will prescribe syllabus with the help and consultations with all the famous islamic scholars, and made compulsory in each and every school, will teach all levels or classes throughout his/her academic career, will teach islamic studies with the help of quran and hadiths in order to make muslims boys and girls, must be aware of islamic teaching right from the childhood with do&#039;s and don&#039;ts in islam and how to live their lives throughout his/ her career, will definitely help them in overcoming all the problems and misconception about islam and muslim. this is the need of the hour and will definitely benefits all including students, parents, teachers, societies and the environment to overcome our day to day problems and will give solution in many ways.note : aimplb should consider my suggestion in the serious manner, must convey and discuss with the scholars with co-ordination with the government at all level to build a healthy, happy, peaceful environment in our society....

Muslim-bashing is supposed to be the sneaky new freedom of ‘New India’ in which unabashed ‘nationalists’ now feel free to give vent to as much ire against minorities as they want, freed at last from the so-called shackles of secular dominance.
The PM defined ‘New India’ as a fight against communalism, casteism and corruption, yet for many it is only a licence to be openly prejudiced. Are the revolutionaries of New India purveying the worst of old Bharat and its biases and passing off plain bigotry as some imagined “Hindu” cultural renaissance? Attacks on women on social media, diktats on what citizens must eat, wear, sing, speak, paint, read, and study, how they must marry, who they must love and hate, are being justified in the name of a ‘new’ nationalism. New India, it seems, is only about a rather Old Bharat.
Five courageous Muslim women fought inspiringly not only for changes in the law but also for a change in patriarchal mindsets. More than the law, the symbolism of women defeating clerics is a powerful one. The modern woman after all is the   enemy No. 1 of organised religion. Religious strictures on menstruation, dress codes, purification rituals, food restrictions play out primarily on the bodies of women.
The women who defeated triple talaq should be role models for women across communities. New India warriors are thumping chests in their “triumph” over Islam, but this is actually a time for introspection. Those who are jubilant at Muslim reform and want to stand up for Muslim women are precisely those who 60 years ago were at the forefront of opposing Hindu reform. When Nehru’s government drove a coach and horses through Hindu marriage and inheritance practices, sangh activists had chanted “Pandit Nehru must perish.”
Instead of demonising the Muslim, isn’t there a need for the Hindu to turn the gaze inwards? Census data for 2011 shows that there are still a large number of Hindu women in polygamous marriages. In fact, bigamy disadvantages Hindu women more than Muslim, because often Hindu women are simply abandoned without rights. The National Commission for Women has documented how Vrindavan widows have suffered. Politicians have been seen endorsing mass child marriages in Rajasthan, and Haryana CM M L Khattar has said khap panchayats are useful in society. For many, khaps must be defended as a mark of Hindu cultural identity. But any attachment to Islamic cultural identity is seen as treasonous and terrorist-friendly.
The symbolic “victory” of  ending instant triple talaq cannot  be allowed to overwhelm the facts. For a society that turns a blind eye to the killing of girls before birth and to the shameful discarding of elderly women, a society that can’t recognise gender or caste injustice and even rationalises them, to talk obsessively of injustice to Muslim women is hardly sincere. While mosques are seen as a male-dominated space, don’t forget the battles women are fighting for equal temple rights, most notably in the case where two Hindu women have taken the Sabarimala priesthood to court.
What about caste prejudice? Vicious attacks on Dalits in Una as well as recently in Vadodara are signs of how rampant caste violence is being given new energy by the so-called votaries of New India and their championship of the cause of the cow. Dalits form the bulk of manual scavengers, 10 of whom died in a month in Delhi. Yet how many mainstream politicians will lend as much support to manual scavengers as they did to the battle against the Muslim clergy? Why do human beings daily choking on excreta not disturb us as much as triple talaq did? That’s because the language of New India is not really about change, it’s only an echo of an old hostility towards minorities.
The PM’s support for the triple talaq judgment is welcome, but why don’t we see similar passionate reformism for gender injustice among Hindus, as well as against empty ritualism and superstition? Red Fort rhetoric must be matched by a commitment to frontally challenging social conservatives on the ground: instead, rationalist voices are silenced and dubbed “anti-national” and “anti-Hindu,” even as antediluvian godmen are embraced. The triple talaq judgment is a defining moment: it’s a conscience call for all reformists to stand together to fight for progressive modern values in every religion: that would be the real New India, an India where every abandoned wife, Muslim or Hindu, is protected.

     For me, the writer&#039;s Blog is just a case of &quot;Darkness at noon&quot;. The writereither just does not know what is happening in West Bengal or has deliberatelytried to hide ugly facts about that state by posting this prejudiced Blog.A prominent TMC minister has said he would not accept Supreme Courtjudgement and his lead has been taken by others. While Chief Ministers ofother states have welcomed Supreme judgement, West Bengal Chief Ministerhas maintained a stony silence about it. I won&#039;t say the writer supports herbut the fact she does not write about it shows she has a sneaking understandingwith her. I often wonder how and why the writer has not written a single Blogabout the disturbing happenings in West Bengal, happenings that would posea big problem for the country one day. But then Modi bashing, baiting andeven hating must come first. All other things are secondary, national interestsnotwithstanding....  Read More

"1616953755-225","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=triple+talaq","Triple talaq will soon be history","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/twinkle-twinkle/triple-talaq-will-soon-be-history/","Triple talaq will soon be history","September 4, 2016, 10:04 PM  IST","Renuka Bisht","When Indian campaigners against triple talaq feel tired and disheartened, they may find strength in remembering that it was against much taller odds that women won the suffrage; also remembering how dominant patriarchy doesn’t just surrender its privileges but fights hard and dirty to hold on to them.
One of the arguments against women’s suffrage was that most women didn’t want it. Today too the All India Muslim Personal Law Board insists that most Muslim women in India don’t want any changes in the Muslim personal law.
Now in response to petitions from Shayara Banu and other Muslim women who have urged the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional, AIMPLB has said: “Sharia grants right to divorce to husbands because men have greater power of decision making. They are more likely to control emotions and not take hasty decisions.”
Those opposing women’s suffrage similarly used to declare them the weaker sex, whose (alleged) physical and moral frailties were justification for their social suppression.
AIMPLB has also told the court: “When serious discords develop in a marriage and husband wants to get rid of wife, legal compulsions and time consuming judicial process … in extreme cases husband may resort to illegal criminal ways of getting rid of her by murdering her. In such situations, the triple talaq is a better recourse.”
Suffragettes were likewise warned that, “It is unwise to risk the good we already have for the evil which may occur.” These threats are very deliberately worded. They are intended to scare the oppressed from asking for justice and equal rights.
Oppressive patriarchy is stuck in a time warp and fighting dirty to keep everyone else staying there too.
What women have on their side is the great tide of civilization, modernity and democracy. Victory is assured but not without more struggle.

By a 3:2 majority SC ruled that this form of talaq is “manifestly arbitrary”, allowing marital ties to be “capriciously and whimsically” broken by a Muslim man, and violated Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing equal protection of the law to men and women. With no chance for reconciliation, many Muslim women have found themselves destitute, with no recourse available in civil law.
The majority verdict attempts a delicate balancing act between individual rights enshrined in Article 14 and religious freedoms guaranteed by Article 25. While Justice Joseph found that triple talaq was against the mandate of Quran and therefore impermissible, Justices Nariman and Lalit also made the more fundamental argument that triple talaq violated Article 14 and therefore needed to be struck down. Since marriage is a civil institution, Article 14 ought to have precedence over Article 25 in case there is conflict between the two. Interestingly, the Union government wanted the court to ban all forms of talaq which none of the judges agreed to. But the government can take credit for lending its immense clout to the Muslim women who approached SC against triple talaq.
It was a colonial era law, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, that surrendered jurisdiction on matters of marriage, divorce, succession and maintenance including talaq to clerics who later banded under the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). But Justice Nariman rightly cited the Constitution’s Article 13(1) which demands that all colonial-era laws not in consonance with fundamental rights be struck down. This is an important intervention. Matters concerning fundamental rights cannot be left to personal law bodies like the arch-conservative AIMPLB.
It is tempting to see the judgment as a body blow to personal laws and politicise it. This is not only incorrect but also dangerous. Rather than an affront to any particular religion it must be viewed as a pit stop in the path towards progressive and egalitarian changes in society. Many Muslim majority countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, have rejected talaq-e-biddat. The government’s emphasis must now shift to ensuring universal marriage registration and reforming personal laws in consultation with community groups to ensure equal rights for men and women in marriage, divorce and alimony.

All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has argued that these practices are part of essential practice under the religion. Asaduddin Owaisi, President of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and member of AIMPLB, spoke to Rohit E David on the issue:

What is your response to the central government’s affidavit in Supreme Court that triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy – all part of Muslim personal law – should be struck down?
Now the matter is in the apex court and they will decide on May 11. The Muslim Personal Law Board has given their version. BJP is saying that other Muslim countries have abolished triple talaq, then why not us? Well, this is not right. No, they haven’t abolished it.
What is your opinion on triple talaq?
My opinion is the same as that of AIMPLB, which has told Muslims that this is not the way to divorce a person. What we can do is that when a Muslim marries a woman he pays a mahr (amount). At the time of marriage, let this condition be incorporated that if a Muslim man divorces a Muslim woman by triple talaq then he will have to pay her over and above that. This should apply to anyone who divorces a Muslim woman without any genuine reason (if you follow the Muslim personal law, there are 17 conditions wherein a divorce can be given).
Unfortunately, that’s not the case in Hindu marriage law, where only seven conditions are given. If any of those 17 conditions are not met then a divorce can happen.
If any Muslim man without having any reason to divorce his wife does it, then the community must socially boycott such elements. Triple talaq is not the best way of divorcing a Muslim woman but talaq happens.
Is it right for a Muslim to have triple talaq?
If you don’t want to get married according to Sharia one has the choice to get married under Special Marriages Act. If you have a nikah and tomorrow you say that you want a talaq, it is open for you to do that and the Muslim personal law applies to you.
How can Muslim women be protected under triple talaq?
How do we safeguard a woman from a man who without having any genuine reasons divorces a lady? Recently, it was reported that a Muslim man gave divorce to his pregnant wife because he thought he’ll have a daughter. This man does not know Sharia. You cannot divorce a Muslim woman when she is pregnant. If a divorce happens, there is a Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act of 1986. That section says, that if you do not want to use this Act use Section 125 of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure), order for maintenance of wives, and Section 128 of CrPc, for recovery of maintenance.  Use it.
Do you feel that people who follow triple talaq should live under Sharia completely?
Can you do it in India? No, you can’t. You cannot impose Sharia laws in a secular country.
Do you feel that the central government is trying to polarise the entire issue?
Whether it is cow, triple talaq, Uniform Civil Code, anti-Romeo squad, ghar wapsi – they are trying to polarise everything. They have failed in governance. They have not been able to provide jobs.
Do you feel that the entire debate on triple talaq is biased?
Yes. Why is it that only the Muslim divorce has become an issue? What about Hindu divorce? In the census of 2011, chart C-3 says there are 43.56 lakh Hindu women who outnumber Hindu married men. Now, this is possible either if they can be in bigamous relationships with Hindu men or of course if it can be proved that they are mostly married to non-Hindus. Why is there no debate on this?
What do you have to say about many Muslim women getting divorce through telegram, phone or mail?
On this, we have to go according to the 2002 Supreme Court judgment on Shamim Ara. In that case, the court clearly said that without reconciliation talaq doesn’t happen.

     anyone should be able to divorce anyone for no reason at all, including muslim women. the party initiating divorce may owe damages to the other party, but the couple can&#039;t be forced to stay married. marriage is a voluntary state by mutual consent, and it there is no consent either party can initiate a divorce. all this talk of &quot;social boycott&quot; is only to avoid facing the issue that islam is a male dominated chauvinistic religion that treats women like property. triple talaq is a blot on humanity and should have been outlawed from day one....

The law is being projected as the Modi government’s supreme act of benevolence towards suffering Muslim women, labouring under the ravages of their nasty talaq-uttering husbands. So will the ban on instant triple talaq win the Muslims over to BJP? Unlikely.
Banning instant triple talaq is about gender justice, not religion, thundered the law minister, showing a crusading zeal the government hasn’t shown with any other law so far. Congress has been put in its place; where it had prevaricated and shamefully bowed to maulvis and maulanas on the Shah Bano case, here was the mighty Modi sarkar flamboyantly undoing Rajiv Gandhi’s historic blunder.
But while the government can claim a political and legislative triumph, bridges have hardly been built between the Hindu nationalist government and its Muslim ‘other’. The clever political choreography masks majoritarian muscle-flexing, an undoubtedly progressive legislation’s intentions are muddied by violent language against minorities, the disingenuous concern for the Muslim woman obscures the fact that for Sangh cadres on the street Muslims are still the dark side of the moon.

Only two weeks ago BJP Ghaziabad city president Ajay Sharma led a mob to disrupt a marriage between a Hindu woman and Muslim man. Before the wedding, the woman’s family had been hounded and harassed by Hindutva activists alleging ‘love jihad’. BJP has now sacked Sharma but the incident has once again revealed the extent to which the anti-Muslim war cry is a galvanising platform for Sangh outfits. Can a selective commitment to gender justice for Muslim women exist in a vacuum of civil rights for Muslims in general?
‘Love jihad’ is a hateful pernicious concept. Yet no less than the Supreme Court has directed that the NIA, created to probe terror cases, investigate the marital choice of two adult Indian citizens only because the woman has chosen to embrace Islam. If every time a Muslim falls in love with a Hindu a violent mob appears on the street intent on wrecking their relationship, the personal freedoms of Muslims are snatched away.
‘Love jihad’ and the mindset that Muslims are spiriting away Hindu women even enjoys some official sanction, the term often used by none other than UP CM Yogi Adityanath. For too many Hindus some even in high positions, ‘Mohammedan’ is still a whispered dreaded word, a word with which apparently a normal modern relationship is impossible. There is a deep self-deluding hypocrisy in banning triple talaq on the one hand and criminalising marital choices between educated adults on the other, as if the Muslim man is always the untrustworthy descendant of Babur, Alauddin Khilji in disguise against whom perpetual war must be waged. The triple talaq law is hardly worth celebrating at a time when Hindutva vigilantes are wreaking havoc through ‘love jihad’ campaigns.
Instant triple talaq admittedly has no place in a modern society and the maulvi has so far exerted disproportionate power over politicians given the urge for Muslim votes. But to proclaim that the triple talaq bill will now forge a new social compact between BJP and Muslims is to wilfully ignore that across India the Muslim feels under siege.
Muslims are at their lowest political representation ever in Parliament and state assemblies. In the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections, BJP did not give a single ticket to a Muslim. The PM may have once castigated gau rakshaks as anti-social but no member of the ruling party has vigorously prosecuted cow criminals and in BJP ruled Rajasthan the attackers of Pehlu Khan have even been ‘honoured’ by the extended Sangh Parivar.
Recently a minister in the Modi government openly rejected the Constitution’s plural values. With impending elections in Karnataka, the BJP’s coastal Karnataka face Anant Kumar Hegde clearly foresees political benefit in anti-Muslim rhetoric. Demonisation of the Muslim is now seen as a highly effective electoral tactic so if it was ‘miyan’ Abdul Lateef in Gujarat, expect Tipu Sultan in Karnataka. In this polarised context, an ostentatious championship of the rights of Muslim women sounds meaningless.
Yet there’s a crying need for a progressive Muslim leadership that steers a courageous course away from orthodox ulemas. But progressive Muslims will only become strong in a political and social environment where the Muslim feels a sense of equal citizenship. If the Muslim’s patriotism is questioned every time a terror attack takes place in Kashmir or Hafiz Saeed makes an anti-India speech, then Muslim firebrands will gain at the cost of the moderates.
The Union minority affairs minister has stated that those who eat beef should go to Pakistan, the BJP president declared that if BJP lost in Bihar there would be fireworks in Pakistan, and no less than the PM has suggested that Pakistan is conspiring to make Ahmed Patel Gujarat CM. Such public pronouncements destroy the possibility of secure and confident Muslim leaders of credibility both within and outside the community who can engage in a dialogue to create a new alliance with Hindus. India’s Constitution speaks of gender justice but also of freedom of religion. You can’t have gender justice for Muslim women in a silo while the surround sound remains stridently anti-Muslim, when Muslims are discriminated against in jobs, housing and politics.
Can India’s law minister ensure that every constitutional freedom premised on the notion of equal citizenship of Muslims is determinedly fought for? If so, he can celebrate with sweets. If not the sweets are only a charade, a mocking photo op for 14% of India’s citizens.

"1616953357-133","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/8/?s=triple+talaq","Sabarimala, Secularism and Sensationalism!","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/in-conversation/sabarimala-secularism-and-sensationalism/","Sabarimala, Secularism and Sensationalism!","January 24, 2019, 3:40 PM  IST","Gajanan Khergamker","“The concept of Secularism is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, right? Why then does the government interfere when the Supreme Court order ensures equality to all women to enter Sabarimala Temple?” asked an angry student of law during a lecture. “It is important to understand Secularism and its role in India, first. You must know the context and learn to distinguish fact from populism too. Don’t get carried away by political statements engineered to simply fan popular sentiments, however illogical,” I said.
The Sabarimala imbroglio has been a populist bone of contention for political parties that have, surprisingly, aligned despite legendary differences for fear of upsetting a sizeable religious faction. The issues here are primarily dual in nature. The Right to Equality of women being compromised by an arguably ‘patriarchal’ custom barring those of menstrual age entry is in direct opposition to the Religious Freedom of the Sabarimala Temple Authorities in conducting their internal affairs. The September 2018 Supreme Court verdict upholding the rights of women of all ages to enter Sabarimala Temple has stirred a hornet’s nest.
Despite the inclusion of the term ‘Secularism’ in the Preamble of the Constitution, the State has, even within the Indian Constitution itself, permitted intervention and legislated on issues that could, if applied in the strictest of senses, be in violation of the ‘Secular’ term. If followed strictly, the State would be not be permitted to intervene in any religious situation that would include the reservation system, protection of the Muslim personal law and the directive principle to protect cows, all of which the Constitution ultimately went ahead with.
For the State to follow the spirit of secularism while avoiding its inclusion in the Preamble, the chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution B. R Ambedkar had, during the Constituent Assembly discussions, said, “what should be the policy of the State, how the Society should be organised in its social and economic side are matters which must be decided by the people themselves according to time and circumstances. It cannot be laid down in the Constitution itself because that is destroying democracy altogether.”
When the preamble to the Constitution was discussed in the Constituent Assembly, there were huge debates over the incorporation of secularism on which all the members agreed yet through extensive debates in the Constituent Assembly revealed the ambiguity inherent in the terminology predominantly Western, when applied in the Indian context. Questions were raised regarding the nature of its application and to what extent it was even possible.
In the debate on December 6, 1948, Lokanath Misra had said, “Do we really believe that religion can be divorced from life, or is it our belief that in the midst of many religions we cannot decide which one to accept? If religion is beyond the ken of our State, let us clearly say so and delete all reference to rights relating to religion.” Even vice president of the drafting committee H C Mookherjee had stated “are we really honest when we say that we are seeking to establish a secular state? If your idea is to have a secular state it follows inevitably that we cannot afford to recognise minorities based upon religion.”
Secularism, in the truest meaning of the term, as was meant to be understood at its place of origin, could not be applied blindly to the Indian context. The term ‘secularism’ is known to have originated in late medieval Europe coined first by English secularist, co-operator, and newspaper editor George Jacob Holyoake was modelled on the theory that governments ought to have no religious connection, nor indeed anything to do with matters of religious belief or ritual.
It was manifestly a Western intervention, specifically a product of the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. It went on to be treated as the ideal theoretical basis of nation-states utilised in lands outside the European continent, such as the United States even Turkey. It was only inevitable for the creators of free, modern India, shaped by European thoughts and practices, to be ardent supporters of secularism.
Consequently, the Constituent Assembly adopted Articles 25, 26 and 27 of the Indian Constitution in order to further secularism that, despite not being formally inserted in the document, was definitely embedded in the constitutional philosophy.
Secularism, as a concept, was introduced through the 42nd amendment which gave unprecedented powers to the Parliament. Almost all parts of the Constitution, including the preamble, was changed with this amendment. Thereafter the description of India in the preamble was changed from “sovereign, democratic republic’ to a ‘sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.”
The State’s intervention on the Instant Triple Talaq issue and its swift concurrence with the Supreme Court view followed by an ordinance, despite loud opposition in Parliament, wasn’t perceived as being violative of Secularism or ‘interference with religious affairs,’ but instead positioned and lauded as a win for Women Rights.
Interestingly, it may be noted here that Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recently, in a written question in Parliament, asked the government to clarify its position on Female Genital Mutilation – a practice among the Bohra Muslims in India. The government had replied that it wasn’t introducing any legislation to ban it and that, in case of any objections raised, the IPC and POCSO had provisions to tackle issues arising. An attempt in the future to legislate on the issue could be seen as an affront to Secular fabric of India and an interference in religious affairs.
Distinct from what ‘is’ right, sadly, it’s what is ‘seen as right’ that matters in a democracy driven by populism and the vote of the majority.

This happened during the second century of the Muhammadan era much after Prophet Muhammad had passed away.
It was done to bypass the true triple talaq as formulated in the Quran. Therefore, this sacrilegious triple talaq in one sitting is called talaq-ul-bidaat – a heretical talaq. It ought not to have been on the statute of Muslim personal law.
The true triple talaq, as ordained by the Holy Quran, is one of the more humane therapies to deal with a downward spiralling marital relationship. Importantly, the most significant injunction in the triple talaq therein is that after each pronouncement of talaq, there has to be compulsorily a period of waiting or iddat that provides a timeout to reflect on the alternatives to a divorce.
Therefore, the instant triple talaq as permitted by the Muslim personal law not only negates the road map of the true triple talaq laid down in the Quran but also gives Islam a bad name. Hence, as the heretical triple talaq is sanctioned neither by the Quran nor by the Prophet’s precepts, it would be legitimate to remove it from the Indian laws and abide by the one and only true triple talaq as set out in the Quran. Only this talaq should continue to remain as part of the Muslim personal law.
As a first step, even before the first talaq can be uttered, the Quran commends a meeting of well-wishers, representing both the sides, to try to save the marriage. However, if they do not succeed then the first of the three talaqs may be invoked. The Quran once again lays down the propriety for it when it says in Verse 65.1: “When ye do divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed periods, and count [accurately], their prescribed periods: and fear Allah your Lord: and turn them not out of their houses.”
Once the first talaq is uttered, during the prescribed waiting period or thereafter, the separated couple can reconcile and resume their marital relationship with a fresh nikaah. However, if after a period of time, friction again arises between them, they can opt for a second talaq following the same sequence as the first.
After having gone through, over a phase, the process of remarrying the same spouse twice, should further discord or strife arise between them, then the third talaq can be uttered. This time it is irrevocable. As the Quran says in Verse 2.229: “A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold together on equitable terms or separate with kindness.”
The Quran goes on further to say in Verse 2.231: “But do not retain them against their will in order to hurt [them]: for he who does so sins indeed against himself … and remain conscious of God.” Therefore, there is a certain code of compassion to be observed in the true triple talaq as laid down in the Holy Quran.
The next issue is the provision of maintenance for the divorced wife. The Quran says in Verse 2:241, “And the divorced women, too, shall have [a right to] maintenance in a goodly manner: this is a duty for all who are conscious of God.” Muhammad Asad has interpreted goodly manner in his commentary in The Message of Quran as, “The amount of alimony – payable unless and until they remarry – has been left unspecified since it must depend on the husband’s financial circumstances and on the social conditions of the time.”
When this Verse or Aiyat 241 in the Quran was pointed out to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, this is what the then Chief Justice of India YV Chandrachud said in his order in the Shah Bano case (1985): “Nor are we impressed by the shuffling plea of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board that, in Aiyat 241, the exhortation is to the ‘Mutta Queena’, that is, to the more pious and the more God-fearing, not to the general run of the Muslims.” This contention of AIMPLB is, to put it mildly, an affront to the piety of the Muslim community.
However, beyond the unwarranted stand of AIMPLB, which plays into the hands of the extremist right-wing Sangh Parivar, lies a resolution to the larger issue of Uniform Civil Code. It is in the fact that the marriage, according to Islam, is not a sacrament but a civil contract. Pakistan Supreme Court has said, “Among Muslims, marriage is not a sacrament, but is in the nature of a civil contract. Such a contract undoubtedly has spiritual and moral overtones and undertones but legally, in essence, it remains a contract between the parties.”
This renders nikahnama (Muslim marriage contract) spiritual, secular and, above all, adaptable. Thus when the Uniform Civil Code comes to be written, it could be Advantage, Muslims. As Salman Khurshid, former Union minister, has said in his foreword to Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan Law (20th Edition), “There is, for instance, much to learn from the contractual nature of nikah.”

Most political pundits were befuddled by the quantum of the mandate that Narendra Modi received in 2014. Working relentlessly for the last five years for all the sections of the society, staying true to his maxim of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, the Narendra Modi government was once again re-elected by a massive mandate. The public had spoken in a unanimous voice and indicated their preference for the good governance model presented and implemented by Narendra Modi.
From liberating our sisters from the hazardous smoke in their kitchen by providing them with gas cylinders or building toilets to protect the dignity of women, ensuring healthcare through Aayushman Bharat or be it the staunch and decisive steps against the corrupt who have looted our country for the last 7 decades, this government since 2014 has set in motion the vision of Ram Rajya as envisioned by the Father of our Nation – Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary we will celebrate on the 2nd of October this year. The basic foundations of the Ram Rajya are based on equal rights for everyone, upliftment and empowerment of the poorest of the poor and a society based on fairness and justice to everybody.
Prime Minister Modi through his Good Governance model has wedded Bapu’s vision of Ram Raya with his own method of Su-rajya.
It is Bapu’s Ram Rajya and Modi’s Su-Rajya that will help us achieve our true potential as a nation and get back to our rightful place in the world. As Bapu had said the political independence does not mean imitating others but to devise a system suited to our own conditions. Mahatma Gandhi called it Ram Rajya.
In the first hundred days of Modi 2.0 government, the Modi government reiterated that it is synonymous with National Security, Welfare of the poor and justice. As the the home minister said in one of his tweets recently, that whether it was the decision to “remove Article 370, Article 35A from Jammu and Kashmir or to free Muslim women from the curse of Triple Talaq or strengthening nation’s security apparatus by amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, all these historic decisions are a result of PM Modi’s decisive leadership.
Our PM’s tireless dedication towards our nation has served as an inspiration to millions of Indians. While our Hon’ble Prime Minister is working tirelessly to create this ‘New India’ on Bapu’s ideals, it’s time that we, the citizen come forward and join hands in Prime Minister’s efforts. A well functioning democracy cannot function until its citizens do not take an active part in contributing towards its well being. Therefore as a tribute to the father of the nation, we must all take a pledge to actively work and supplement the efforts of PM Modi. Our Prime Minister takes pride in calling himself Pradhan Sewak, and we must from our end too try and emulate his zeal and passion and be a Sewak by actively being in service of the society. Nothing can be a bigger tribute to both PM Modi and Bapu then to work towards realising Bapu’s Ram Rajya by helping Modi’s Su-rajya.
We have to alert people that “Chowkidari”is the need of the hour. We have to be alert to the injustices meted out to the poor, make them aware of all the good governance initiatives of the government that will befit them. We will also have to contribute in our own way to help the PM achieve his priorities, like Swacch Bharat, freeing mother earth from the suffocating choke of plastic, conserving water by ensuring its judicious use and also encouraging others to do it.
The youth of our nation have a special responsibility towards the development of the nation as they are the engine which will propel India forward. Today, India is the youngest nation of the world. 65% of the population is below 35 years of age. The strength of the youth can change the fate of the country. It can become the fuel for the entire country. Every youth in this country must aspire to take up one cause and dedicate their efforts in finding its resolution. This pledge for nation building can be better understood with a quote of Swami Vivekananda ji.
Swamiji had said – “Life is short, but the soul is immortal and eternal, and one thing being certain, death, let us therefore take up a great idea and give up our whole life to it”
As PM Modi had once said If our goals are not clear, we will not be able to achieve it. If you are confused about which train to board after reaching the platform, you can neither reach your destination nor frame your itinerary.
To conclude, as responsible citizens of the nation, I believe we are all obliged to contribute to the efforts of PM Modi in realising his vision of achieving Bapu’s Ram Rajya through his efforts in Su-Rajya. As a humble tribute to our beloved PM, I am going to take a pledge that Main bhi Sewak, Main bhi Modi.

The court, while hearing a petition challenging the constitutional validity of triple talaq, polygamy and halala, which mandates a divorced woman to marry and consummate marriage with another man before remarrying her former husband, had asked the central government for its opinion.
These are not essential parts of the religion, the Centre has told the court and further asserted that these provisions violate gender justice, equality and women’s dignity.
The latter is the core of the issue.

The country’s Constitution upholds fundamental democratic rights and counts rights of minorities to profess, practise and propagate their religion as part of democratic rights.
Minority rights are not patronage, as they were under many kings in the past. These are part and parcel of democratic rights.
However, when minority custom comes in conflict with basic democratic rights, custom must yield to democratic rights. Undemocratic and unequal practices cannot continue in the name of minority rights.
The notion that Muslim existence would be jeopardised if some sections of the sharia relating to the treatment of women are abandoned is spurious. Some of these practices have been rendered illegal in several Muslim-majority countries.
Besides, Muslims in India suffer no religious derogation for not following the sharia in criminal justice or financial matters. It should be noted that the Goa civil code, Portuguese till the 1960s, has no discriminatory provisions for Muslim women.

Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, a member of the Rajya Sabha, is national vice-president of Bharatiya Janata Party. In a conversation with Sugandha Indulkar, he defends some of the government’s controversial decisions:
BJP was known for its collective leadership. After 2014, hasn’t the nature of power structure in BJP changed with just two leaders dominating? 
Collective leadership is the mainstay of BJP functioning. We office bearers meet regularly, review the organisational and political situation, and discuss before we decide. How can a cadre based party with such a mass following be run by just two leaders? That can happen only in a dynasty-driven party where leadership is reserved by birth.
In 2014, BJP received broad-based support for a development agenda. Have issues like cow vigilantism hurt your prospects?
It is wrong to link cow vigilantism with our party or our larger school of thought. On several occasions our leaders have condemned those taking law into their hands. People are wise enough to make a distinction between a responsible political party and some fringe elements. Cow protection is not the agenda of BJP alone. It is mentioned in Article 48 of the Constitution of India. But again, the issue was ignored for decades for crass vote bank politics.
It’s claimed the Ram Mandir agenda has brought BJP electoral benefits. Do your supporters feel let down?
Please don’t look at Ram Mandir as an election issue. BJP passed a resolution on the issue at Palanpur in Himachal Pradesh some 30 years ago and many elections have taken place since then. Some lawyers in tandem with the opposition have been creating roadblocks in the rapid completion of Ram Mandir. I hope the judiciary will be adequately sensitive towards the urgency in this regard and I hope all political parties will reject the lure of vote bank politics.
Why has your government been afraid of releasing some economic data?
It is a false and baseless notion. Why would we do that when international thinktanks and bodies like IMF and World Bank acknowledged the success of this government on the economic front?
There appears to be a mismatch between the government’s advertisements and ground reality. How would explain the absence of benefits even now? 
One has to go to the interiors of our country to find out the truth. Public relations strategies don’t get you success in states like Uttar Pradesh or Assam. Substantial achievements do. We tagged technology with welfare schemes to do away with pilferage. Even an illiterate tribal sister from a remote hilly region today knows that her benefits are now directly deposited to her bank account and no middleman can do any mischief. Even forest officials today admit that with the expanding reach of the Ujjwala LPG scheme, illegal felling of trees has remarkably reduced.
Supreme Court had declared triple talaq illegal. Where was the need to criminalise triple talaq with another bill?
The government introduced various amendments in the revised Bill and later an ordinance was issued. And frankly, there is a long history of Supreme Court rulings and opinions calling for a Common Civil Code that would automatically take care of triple talaq related issues. Despite that, injustice to Muslim women continued. Do you expect society to continue to ignore the criminality in instant talaq? So a substantive Act was essential.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was bound to stoke anxiety in the north-east. Why did the government persist on this path?
Our concern for the north-east and other border areas requires no proof. Attempts to create misperceptions about Citizenship Bill notwithstanding, let me say that our intentions behind the Bill are in tune with our commitment to the well-being and development of all our border areas, including the north-east. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had established the DONER ministry (development of north eastern region), which was neglected by UPA. We have revitalised its functioning with huge impetus given to infrastructural development in the north-east. The developmental projects that have been commenced or completed in the north-east in the past five years speak for themselves.
Isn’t BJP’s adherence to the spirit of the Constitution a bit suspect? 
The prime minister has always said that Constitution is supreme for him. Those who played with the fundamental character of the Constitution during the dark night of the Emergency, are whitewashing their sins by creating suspicion about others.

     structure in BJP changed with just two leaders dominating?The main stay of BJP is popularity of Modi with his oratory and finance by Businessmen. There is no other leader in BJP except Modi and Shah which is putting India in the hands of Delhi based bureaucracy as it was case in Congress regime. The BJp does not have dedicated cadre but the RSS cadre support is putting BJP leadership in the forefront in present state. BJP does not have any development agenda but it us appeasement policy to poor in the name of insurance schemes which is helping insurance agency run by big businessmen and siphoning the taxpayers money. The issue of  Ram Mandir and Cow have not taken off to ensure victory for BJP in coming election due to its inherent leaning towards Hindus and thus separating them from Muslims. The judiciary is being played by Modi and his team which is evident on the verdict of Mamta and bureaucracy of Bengal and therefore the fate of Ram Mandir remains inconclusive. How government project certificates of their deeds from foreign institutions rather than relying on their own data is not understood by any patriotic person. Government is relying on media similar to that in 2004 of shining India when coffin gate brought dooms to their fortune. Similar is the case now with Rafale deal where Modi was lone mediator and same is being highlighted by Opposition. The benefits of Ayushman Bharat or clearing of Ganga or Swachh Bharat are yet to come to showcase the achievement of government. The soldiers dissatisfaction over OROP when servicemen protest at Jantar Mantar has crossed more than five hundred days with no government intervention to resolve the issue clearly indicated callus approach of BJP and its leadership. Lip service is good but effect should be evident on ground also and present reality on ground is very different what Modi is projecting through his speeches....

To give effect to that judgment the Union government has now constituted a ministerial committee to frame a law. This is because instances of triple talaq continue to be reported and many more are perhaps going unreported. With lack of deterrent punishment assessed as a key contributing factor, there has been a demand for legislative protection against triple talaq. Time is short with Parliament likely to reassemble on December 15 but if government does manage to table this legislation it is bound to be a high point of the winter session.
However disagreements in marriage are normally civil matters and injustice to one party, not constituting violence, is best treated as a civil offence. State can step in to resolve differences and ensure equitable terms of disengagement. Criminalising divorce, even an illegal one, would be overreach. Even the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act is a civil law meant to protect women, not penalise criminally. Civil divorce laws leave enough room for rapprochement, but the Centre’s proposed criminalisation of triple talaq may close out this option.
This doesn’t mean the state should refrain from aid to women suffering triple talaq. The proposed legislation could impose a fine, offer women recourse under civil law to get a legal divorce and maintenance, or invoke progressive judicial interpretations of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. Clearly the issues that arise are more complex than criminalising some Muslim men. Gains from the SC judgment, which was accepted by all major Muslim groups, mustn’t go waste.
Government must consult all stakeholders, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan. Some Muslim women groups would prefer codification of Muslim personal law rather than piecemeal legislation. Other forms of talaq are also gender unjust. Meanwhile government’s promise to enact a uniform civil code to efface differences between religious denominations on such matters vital to gender equality like age of consent, polygamy, grounds for divorce, maintenance and inheritance, is yet to materialise. The truly aspirational target would be to draft the UCC legislation offering a vision of equality and due procedure for all of Indian society.

     Supreme Court had set aside talaq-e-biddat or triple Talaq as unconstitutional. To give effect to that judgment the Union government has now constituted a ministerial committee to frame a law to efface medieval practice against the interest female folk of minority community, which was overdue but successive Govt failed to act. Aftermath of  Apex Court ruling which obliterated this age old practice which was unjust with the minority women, formal law will be in place to empowerment of victim to approach to court in case of Tripile Talak or Polygamy which is not less to majority medieval practices when widow were force to burn along with her spouse (Sati)? When majority female folk have got rid from this inhuman and brutal practice? So, question begged here how long their counterpart minority women have been bear the burn from the brutal or medieval practice of Triple Talak and polygamy?...

Just like king Dashrath, the ageing SP patriarch- Mulayam Singh Yadav- wants to see his elder son Akhilesh Yadav installed as chief minister in 2017 if his party retains power. For most, this would have been the logical step as the son enjoys popular support among the party rank and file. But then enters the second wife and the script of a happy family changes into palace intrigue and mistrust between the ruling clan.

So who is this mystery woman- Sadhna Gupta? Why is she being blamed for the feud in a family that withstood all sorts of pressure and heartbreak stoically for over two decades but is on the verge of a split now?

Many believe that it was in the year 1982 when Mulayam first saw Sadhna- almost 22 years younger than him- after he became president of Lok Dal. Four years later, Sadhna married Chandra Prakash Gupta, a resident of Farukkhabad with whom she had a child- Prateek Gupta- born on July 7, 1987 at district hospital, Fatehgarh. Sadhna eventually left her husband in September next year and the couple were officially divorced by 1990.

When Mulayam was sworn in as chief minister for the first time in 1989, there were murmurs of him having two wives. Till then it was common knowledge that Mulayam’s immediate family consisted of his wife- Malti Devi- and son Akhilesh born in 1973. Mulayam’s secret affair with Sadhna was kept under wraps from the family as the father was wary of son Akhilesh’s reaction. But things changed after Malti Devi passed away in 2003 when Sadhna slowly started putting pressure on Mulayam to accept her as his wife.

Akhilesh’s current unhappiness with Amar Singh stems from the fact that many believe he was instrumental in Mulayam relenting to accept Sadhna as his wife in 2007. Akhilesh has never been in favour of allowing Sadhna and her son being allowed entry within the family. Matters were made worse when Mulayam filed an affidavit in Supreme Court stating Sadhna and Prateek are his family members in the Disproportionate Assets (DA) case being probed by CBI.

Beside Shivpal Yadav what action did Akhilesh Yadav take on millions of loot by Prateek Yadav/Sadhna Gupta?https://t.co/QpK701vPEo

There is little doubt that Sadhna wanted to be a part of Mulayam’s coterie but she didn’t have access due to Akhilesh’s opposition. As per sources, Prateek’s school records show his address as Mulayam’s official residence in Lucknow dating back to 1994. After Sadhna gained entry into Mulayam’s official house, Akhilesh camp has accused her of amassing huge properties and getting her people appointed to plum postings during SP regimes (2003-07 and 2012- to date).

The Sadhna camp seems to have been ruffled with the way Akhilesh’s popularity has gone up by leaps and bounds in the past two years due to his assiduously cultivated pro-youth and development image. Prateek’s wife, Aparna, has already been announced as SP candidate from Lucknow Cantt seat indicating the family nurse political ambitions. With an ailing Mulayam, this is the last gamble for high stakes, and the wife seems have played her cards well.

This is the triumph of the political will where the government in power understood the will of the masses. I am writing this not to say that governance is influencing judiciary but it speeded up the process, which clearly shows the political will. It also indicates the unwillingness of the earlier governments to resolve the issue. Now the country is ready to move ahead with the belief that their dues will be respected and paid off.
The verdict should be respected as it considered the case comprehensively and not for a brief period of time i.e. after the independence of India. Supreme court took the substantial basis on the findings given by ASI, which clearly says that a grand temple existed here. This verdict also shows the strength of democracy where majority and minority will not be considered, where faith and attachments’ will not be considered and only the hard-core facts with the evidences will be considered upon. This has exactly happened in the case of Ram Mandir verdict where all evidences were taken into consideration and the decision was taken on reality not on any other emotion or belief. This is the beauty of the democracy where patience, faith in the system and law and hope for justice are the few highlights.
This can be seen as the new dawn on the development of new India. The unanimous 5-0 decision clearly shows that the manifesto promises are kept and fulfilled by the governments now. The issues are not kept alive for taking political mileage and votes. Present government action on triple talaq, Article 370 and now Ram Mandir indicates towards the intensions of the government. This government is here to work and deliver.

The decriminalisation of adultery by the Supreme Court as a criminal offence was long overdue.
The offence was conceived in 1837, enacted in 1860 and has been on the statute book since.
In 1954 the Supreme Court (five judges) refused to invalidate the adultery provisions because the petitioner was not an Indian citizen and targeting only husband was not violative of equality because special provisions could be made for women and children.
Inclusion of adultery as an offence in Macaulay’s “Notes on the Indian Penal Code” in 1837 was because it offended the concept of marriage while noting that the populace was divided on this and the “dearest interest of the human race are closely connected with the chastity of women and the sacredness of nuptial contract”. The offence in the Indian Penal Code (Section 497) was strangely worded so that a male committing consensual sexual intercourse (not kissing or being in the arms of) with a married woman could be punished by jail up to five years or fine or both even if his wife consented to his actions. Adultery with a non-married woman was permissible and women could not be punished. Now, of course, consensual homo-sexuality by a man or woman (married or not) with a man or woman (unmarried or not) has been decriminalised. The 1954 judgment was barely a page and lacked plaintive reasoning.
The adultery provisions represented Victorian ideas about the sexuality of men and women and did not even protect the institution of marriage. In fact, the next provision (Section 498) was about taking, enticing or detaining a married woman with criminal intent of sexual intercourse.
So, perhaps married men could go for consenting non-married men. This, they thought, would protect marriage as an institution in relation to the adulterous man and his “victims” even if his wife consented for whatever reason.
The recent Supreme Court judgment provides many reasons for decriminalising and, indeed, striking down the provision leaving no scope for interpretation. But it is not correct to say that the Supreme Court has validated adultery as a perceived wrong. This is for the parties to decide. The crucial and invariably painful decision whether the marital relationship should result in divorce to decide issues of custody of minor children and maintenance has to be made by the person. Maintenance still yields civil and criminal remedies. True there are some who believe that this decision of the Supreme Court takes the moral sting out of “adultery”. It is also argued that this judgment will give a licence to adulterous relationships. Adultery remains a ground for divorce but do we want to criminalise it? Should women be included as accused in adultery? In some countries, women are publicly stoned to death for adultery.
What kind of punishment should there be? Imprisonment and/or fine. Extra marital relationship could result in divorce. Litigation, including matrimonial litigation, curses all parties. It becomes an endless process. Litigants in India are not prone to accept mediation.
Matrimonial litigation nurses a continuing sense of ‘hurt’. Family and friends are drawn out to provide support and advice, which is inevitable even necessary. During the fighting, the liberational possibilities of a divorce with settlement are not always seen. Some see adultery as a sin and not just another unapproved relationship.
This is a cross that any ‘erring’ or ‘non-erring’ party must bear. I also do not want to get into absolutist discussions (reminiscent of the Hart-Devlin controversy in England) about the necessity of law not just reflecting but strongly enforcing or not enforcing morals. In England that led to the decriminalisation of both suicide and homosexuality.
In India, we have now decriminalised consensual sexual adult relationships of all kinds. India permits sanctioned euthanasia under condition of prescribed due process. But attempted suicide was restored in the Gyan decision (1995) after a Rathinam decision (1992) had decriminalised it. This has to be remedied by the mental health legislation. At the same time, a two judge bench of Justice Dipak Misra (as he then was) and Justice Pant refused to decriminalise defamation.
Defamation is the sport of politicians and the powerful to attack each other and the media. Such a restraint, on free speech, if reasonable is constitutionally permissible. But the issue there was not defamation should not remain a civil cause of action but whether it should attract imprisonment of up to two years and/or unlimited fine. This needs examination by a larger bench.
But we can see that the Supreme Court’s policy of decriminalisation of offences in the Indian Penal Code requires consistency. I am not suggesting dismantling the Penal Code because it was colonial in origin.
The Law Commission has examined the Penal Code. A complete redrafting may not be necessary.
But we do need to examine the code for what needs to be decriminalised before social relations and choices lead to criminal punishment. The Sexual Freedom case has pointed a direction, which is relevant even though it has a limited and general scope. All that is perceived ‘sinful’ or ‘immoral’ by some is not necessarily criminal. Postcolonial and post-millennial decriminalisation in some areas is necessary. Now, Triple Talaq is criminalised.
The Supreme Court’s decisions are based on securing the dignity of people, obviating punishments when civil remedies are available and dispensing with the archaic when its time has gone.

The Court does stray into pastures where it has no plausible fodder to chew, such as when it orders cinemas to play the national anthem before the screening of a movie and citizens, to stand to attention. But on the whole, the Court lives up to the expectation that it would serve as a solid pillar of Indian democracy.
When the ruling party at the Centre manoeuvred to bring under President’s rule states with functional legislatures, the Court intervened to reverse the move. When the central government issued rules that practically ruled out the sale of cattle for slaughter, abrogating both the right of the states to regulate such activity within their territory as well as the right of a large army of workers to earn a livelihood from the meat and leather processing industries, the Court intervened to stay the rules.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-76698"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Supreme-court-agencies.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Supreme-court-agencies.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Supreme-court-agencies-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
In these measures, the Court indeed served as the guardian of the Constitution. When the Court asked states to enforce a rule that prohibits the sale of liquor in the vicinity of state and national highways, it threw into disarray large chunks of the hospitality industry. Investment in hotels and bars along highways suddenly turned infructuous.
The Court has offered, of late, some relief in relation to properties located within municipal limits but is yet to undo the damage done to investments along highways outside city limits. This week, the Court delivered two momentous decisions, one to invalidate the practice of instant, arbitrary divorce among Muslims and the other, to affirm the right to privacy as a fundamental right, even if not specifically so enumerated in the Constitution.
Of particular note in the privacy judgement was the ability and readiness of a nine-member Constitution bench to acknowledge and remedy errors in past findings of the court. Justice Chandrachud set the heartwarming example of listing a judgement by a bench that included his father as having been erroneous, the judgement being the one that accepted a government contention, made during the Emergency, that the right to life and liberty under Article 21could be suspended in certain circumstances.
The privacy judgement surveyed several past judgements that refused to cede privacy the status of afundamental right and declared them to be wrong. This ability of the Indian Supreme Court to identify and correct its own past mistakes is most encouraging. It offers grounds for optimism that some egregious errors in the five-member bench’s decision invalidating triple talaq would be remedied, sooner rather than later.
In that judgement, three judges, a majority of the five constituting the bench, determined that personal laws are insulated from the reformative scrutiny of fundamental rights, by virtue of being protected by the right to freedom of conscience under Article 25. This is most unfortunate.
Can faith and custom prevail over basic democratic rights such as the right to equality, the right to legal remedy and the right to non-discrimination by the state, especially when Article 25 says that the right is subject to considerations of health, morality and public order, apart from other fundamental rights? Unfortunately, the majority answered in the affirmative.
Fortunately, one judge nevertheless opined against triple talaq, pushing the opinion of two other judges who found triple talaq to be invalid into a majority. But he based his order against triple talaq on the finding that the practice was not only not integral to Islam but also contravened the spirit of the Quran. Is it the job of justices of the Supreme Court to interpret religious texts? Or is it their job to see if a faith-derived practice or norm falls foul of the Indian Constitution, and if it does, to declare it void in temporal life?
The two judges who did not think personal law deserved protection under Article 25 ruled against triple talaq on the ground of arbitrariness, rather than grounding their opinion on equality of men and women. Divorce provisions that privilege the male thus still await judicial annulment. The derivation of arbitrariness from the right to equality is itself of dubious validity, even if based on past rulings.
The privacy ruling offered victims of Article 377 shelter under the cloak of privacy. But this is rather flimsy protection. Why should sexual orientation be a matter of privacy, rather than of personal liberty? A major feature of the Supreme Court is its ability to correct errors of its own past. We sincerely hope these errors would get corrected in future judgements as well.

He said whomever Allah has given two daughters towards whom he is kind, they will be a reason for him to enter Paradise. All of this highlights how important women should be in Islam.
But today it is unfortunate to see the very reverse in most parts of the world. In India we have squandered the legacy that would have kept us in the mainstream, ie modern education. If women are not educated then automatically half the Muslim community is handicapped, and so the community is doomed. Gross misinterpretations of the Quran are part of our life, as most clerics who advise us do not themselves know Arabic.
It is time for Muslims to introspect. Playing the victim will not take us anywhere. We have to start taking care of our own. Jews, Sikhs and Parsis are the real minorities in India, with a very small share of the population. Yet they are surviving, indeed thriving as equals in India. Why? Because they are highly educated.
Religious education is important for everybody, including Muslims. But we must aim to be part of the mainstream, not apart from it. It is time to manage zakat and waqfs well. These have assets worth lakhs of crores. If these assets are used responsibly for the public benefit, it can transform our community.

Who will ensure this? We alone can do it, and must do it ourselves. Not the ministry of minority affairs, or some MP or MLA. Enormous waqf funds have been squandered by Muslims themselves, something never thought possible when waqfs were created.
Waqf properties could be a powerful instrument for uplifting the poor and revolutionising the quality of education. Why then is it that most people who have been heading the boards have been of doubtful credibility? Is PM Modi responsible for this mess also?
Christians have set up world class educational institutions to which people from every community want to send their children, pulling every possible string and offering large donations to get in. How many have we set up? Global zakat is estimated at $200 billion, ready to be routed to worthy causes. If we organise ourselves to become worthy recipients, Indian Muslims can benefit enormously from this global treasure.
Madarsas of poor educational quality are created for the poor, while rich Muslims send their children abroad or to convent schools. Is this just? The Prophet has said that what you seek for yourself, you should seek for your brethren too. Some secular state governments have gone on overdrive to facilitate madarsas and Urdu teachers, increase the salary of imams, and in one state even provide housing for imams. Has this helped the community? No, a particular section of Muslims has been patronised while ordinary Muslims still languish in poverty and illiteracy.
Islam talks of cleanliness, and courteous behaviour towards all. The concept of neighbourliness, if followed sincerely, will lead to zero conflict as it cuts across all castes and communities.
Triple talaq is not in the Quran. Why do we follow this custom? Do we give women the rights they are entitled to, with grace and empathy? We build airconditioned, well-carpeted mosques while in the neighbourhood women are struggling to make ends meet and cannot pay school fees for their children. Do we actually read the Quran with its full meaning? If yes then why do we follow empty and meaningless priorities? There is no mention of wearing skull caps in the Quran, so why make it a prestige issue?
Muslims in India are a strength to the nation. Let critics say anything, they will not be able to prove that we are any less loyal to the nation than anyone else. Let’s take it upon ourselves to get our act together, and be educated and economically sound. That alone can get us on the same platform as anyone else. We should lead by example as instructed by our own Prophet.
It is time for Muslims to think, introspect and take charge of their lives. If we don’t do this, then politicians like Modi, Shah and Yogi Adityanath are always there to pass on the blame for our plight on our own failings.

     A very good article. Mainly Muslim religious leaders are responsible for the present condition of their community. They preach fundamentalism and hatred between Muslims and other communities, mainly Hindus, and are instrumental in keeping them poor and illiterate. They misinterpret Quran and support wrong traditions and customs like triple talaq and halala. The political leaders of their community arouse their anti-national sentiments and try to project them as their only well wishers and keep them out of national mainstream which suits their vested interests. Politicians of all other parties have also taken advantage of their prevailing backwardness and used them as vote banks but never thought of their upliftment. Other communities, like Sikhs, Paris, Jews, are real minority communities and these have thrived and progressed more than majority community and donâ  t have any tension between each other. This is because these communities have modern outlook and believe in modern education system and donâ  t allow wrong customs to percolate in their societies....

It’s a political hot potato that no government wants to pick up. Hence, a Uniform Civil Code, as envisioned in Article 44 of the Constitution, has never been seriously debated. Indeed, any attempt to bring it into the public discourse has been greeted with howls of protest from the majority of India’s Muslims, who feel that a UCC, which would subject every Indian citizen to the same civil laws such as those on marriage, divorce, inheritance and so on, would pose an existential threat to them.
However, this week the Supreme Court lobbed the issue right into the public domain by declaring that the practices of polygamy and triple talaq allowed under Muslim Personal Law were not just grossly unfair to women, but were also a violation of their fundamental rights. A bench of Justices A.R. Dave and A.K. Goel said Muslim Personal Law needed to evolve with the times. The judges went on to request the Chief Justice of India to set up a Bench to examine the issue of gender discrimination in Muslim personal law.
This comes in the wake of a Supreme Court directive earlier this month, asking the Centre if it was serious about implementing a Uniform Civil Code so that “all religions are regulated by the same yardsticks in matters of law”.
Of course, an indignant All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has declared that it would never accept any “tinkering” with Muslim personal law. Clearly, the AIMPLB sees no wisdom in the judges’ view that Muslim personal laws need to move with the times.
However, insofar as personal laws are concerned, Muslim orthodoxy is already under pressure to move with the times. And, ironically, the pressure is coming from within the community. In August this year, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a Mumbai-based NGO, conducted a survey of Muslim women across 10 states. The results were an overwhelming indictment of the twin practices of unilateral triple talaq and polygamy, practices that permit a Muslim man to divorce his wife or marry again according to his own sweet will. Of the 4710 women surveyed, 92.1% wanted triple talaq to be abolished. As many as 91.7% wanted a ban on polygamy.
Polygamy is, in fact, banned in several Islamic countries such as Tunisia and Turkey. Triple talaq delivered at one go, and without a “rethink” period, is outlawed in countries like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Evidently, these countries did not consider it un-Islamic to tweak the sharia law and make it more gender just.
Then why do bodies like the AIMPLB continue to resist changes to Muslim personal laws?
Part of the reason lies in the fact that they fear any change would be a prelude to bringing in a Uniform Civil Code. That begs another question: Nearly 70 years after Independence, why does the prospect of a UCC seem so unpleasant to some? If we enjoy equal rights as citizens of India should we not be bound by the same laws – including laws on marriage, divorce, succession and so on? No community gets stripped of its cultural or religious identity or distinctiveness just because it is subject to a common law. To argue otherwise is sheer cussedness. It serves no one – except bigots and practitioners of vote bank politics.
In the 1980s, in the aftermath of the famous Shah Bano case, the Congress government of Rajiv Gandhi brought in an act to overturn a Supreme Court ruling on maintenance given to Muslim women. That was a prime example of how India’s political establishment is pathologically leery of any action that remotely resembles a move to bring in uniformity in civil laws – because it fears upsetting the electoral applecart.
Though it supports a UCC on paper, the NDA government has also done nothing in this regard as yet. There are dim murmurs of starting a consultation process involving all stakeholders. But don’t be surprised if the matter is stalled – blocked in the legislature even if the judiciary presses the issue, as it seems to be doing now.
Speaking at a public lecture in Mumbai this week, historian Romila Thapar urged the government to implement a uniform civil code that gives equal rights to all citizens. “And it’s not just about the Muslim personal law like everybody thinks. I am talking about khap panchayats and all the socio-legal inequalities that every religion carries. Decide what are the kind civil laws you would like to see removed? Sit down with the Khap Panchayats in Haryana and say that your powers are to be cut. Start a discussion there,” she said.
Thapar could not have said a truer word. The furious resistance to a UCC arises in part from the anxiety that it will be based on a “majoritarian Hindu” jurisprudence. That amxiety must be demonstrably laid to rest.
Muslims and other minorities must also be made to feel totally secure. There is no place for beef-related lynchings, and majoritarian cultural diktats in a society that wants to bring in uniform civil laws. If you do not ensure that all are equal before law and do not guarantee their safety, minority communities will cling to their personal laws as their one area of certainty and identity.
The Supreme Court is right in urging changes to Muslim personal laws. But whether or not that gradually paves the way to a Uniform Civil Code depends on how even-handed we are in dealing with every Indian community.

Within this six months several historic and transformative decisions have been taken by Modi 2.0 touching positively, in particular, the lives of poor, downtrodden, farmers, women, youth, middle class, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes.

The overarching principle and spirit of all decisions by the Modi government has been “India First”. In line with the mandate and faith re-imposed emphatically by the people of India, the government under Modi’s dynamic leadership has engaged in realising and fulfilling the promises made by the BJP in its election manifesto.
With the larger vision of “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas”, Modi 2.0 is steadfastly working and seeking “Sabka Vishwas”.
Several core promises of the BJP have already been fulfilled. One Nation, One Flag, One Constitution became a reality under the Modi government.
It was a historic moment when the bill to abrogate Article 370, piloted by BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah, was passed by Parliament. The passage of the triple talaq bill has delivered gender justice to Muslim women.
The six months’ tenure of Modi 2.0 in the country also saw the historic verdict of the Supreme Court on Ayodhya, paving the way for the construction of a magnificent Ram temple on “Ram Janmabhoomi”.
Significantly, some of the key political opponents did everything to delay the judgement on Ayodhya. However, as mentioned by Modi in his “Mann Ki Baat” programme, the spirit of peace and harmony that prevailed post-Ayodhya verdict was a testimony to the strength of Indian democracy.
India is on the right path to become a 5 trillion dollar economy soon. With major decisions like strategic disinvestment of PSUs and reforms like tax, labour and banking, the Indian economy is strengthening.
Corporate tax rates have been slashed to 22% for existing and 15% for new domestic manufacturing companies. India now has one of the lowest tax rates, making it one of the most competitive global economies.
Today, the world looks up to India for providing solutions to global issues like climate change and sustainable development and we are no more back benchers.
During the recent Climate Action Summit in New York, the world was taken by surprise when Modi announced that India is going to increase energy produced from non-fossil fuels to 175 GW by 2022, and will further take it to 450 GW. At the same summit the PM also launched a Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.
On the domestic front we have transferred Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds to the tune of Rs 47,436 crore, to 26 states and Union territories for afforestation. We have ensured that tribal rights are protected fully and tribals continue to be  important stakeholders in forest development.
Government is taking all efforts for the mitigation of air pollution in the country. The central government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy with targets to achieve 20% to 30% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024.
The Modi government is determined to take all steps to fight the menace of air pollution and I can assure you that New Delhi will take less time than Beijing to improve its air quality.
Flying clean and high, the Modi government has brought Rafale to India. With this, the litany of false allegations against the government has fallen apart.
Strengthening its outreach to the far-flung areas, the Union government is in the process of setting up of 118 more community radio stations. The Indian Institute of Mass Communication has been tasked with training and capacity building for the same.
In order to enhance the accessibility of television programmes for the hearing impaired, we have asked for the implementation of Accessibility Standard for TV programmes.
Countering fake news has been high on the government’s agenda. We are setting up a fact checking unit in order to identify and effectively counter fake news narratives related to government and its policies.
Modi believes in public participation by which behaviour can be changed. He had proved this through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and building toilets.
Now he has given a clarion call for “Say No to Single Use Plastic”. During just 15 days’ campaign, 13,000 tonnes of plastic waste were collected.
He has also appealed to people to do “plogging”, that is, while jogging or walking, picking and properly disposing of polythene littered on the streets or pathways.
Though six months are a very short period, when we look back, a phenomenal achievement has been made by Modi government 2.0.

"1616953390-141","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/8/?s=triple+talaq","Why does the Hindu base fall for it every time?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/strategic-insights/why-does-the-hindu-base-fall-for-it-every-time/","Why does the Hindu base fall for it every time?","June 6, 2019, 2:47 PM  IST","Sunil Sharan","Amit Shah inserted into his party’s manifesto that he’ll abrogate Article 370. Now he’s in pole position to do so. He’s already said that he’ll have zero tolerance for terror.
 
When Sonia Gandhi ruled India, she took objection to the term zero tolerance. She said that it was an American concoction, from a people, the American, who has no tolerance for anything. One of her wise moments of witty candour!

When Maharajah Hari Singh acceded to India, he did so under J&K being allowed special status. That meant Article 370 inserted into the Indian Constitution. That meant autonomy to J&K, the autonomy that has slowly but surely been eroded.
 
Amit Shah has sworn to uphold the Indian Constitution. Does that not mean Article 370 too?  Or is 370 not part of the Constitution? In any case, abrogation of 370 will necessitate a constitutional amendment, and such an amendment will require two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

Nitish Kumar has already said that he doesn’t want to scrap 370, so even with all good tidings, the BJP/NDA combine will have about 320 votes in the Lok Sabha to abrogate 370. That is nowhere near a two-thirds majority of 364 seats required in a Lok Sabha of maximum 545 seats. In the Rajya Sabha, things are even worse. The BJP has only 74 seats there in a house of 245 seats, far from being even an absolute majority.

370 is therefore not going anywhere anytime soon. Removing it was just a ploy to gin up the base. The base believes that the Kashmiri Muslim doesn’t want to be part of India; if only the special privileges accorded him were removed, then he would be forced to rest content. The security forces and even influencers like Anupam Kher and Kangana Ranaut have fed off this narrative.

If only it was as simple as that. If only India did not have an “us versus them” Kashmir policy. If only India had any Kashmir policy at all, other than ham-handed tactics.

As with 370, so too with the Ram Mandir. Modi & Co were surprisingly quiet about building the Ram Mandir during his first tenure. So too during the election campaign. The excuse was that the matter was sub-judice, pending before the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court has already torn apart the Allahabad High Court’s judgment to parcel out the land to three parties. Now it has set up a team of mediators. Perhaps it’s trying to buy time, but how much time can it really buy? From 1992 to 2019 is a long time. The nation awaits, one way or the other.

But the Supreme Court is a group of wise men and women who will not do anything to tear apart the social fabric of the country. It will also not want to be seen to be taking sides. How then can the temple be built on the very site that the bhakt demands?

Modi 2.0 has so much more to worry about than building the temple. Elections 2019 were a close call for Modi even though it seems otherwise in hindsight. A one-term PM such as Rajiv Gandhi got known for computerization; another one-termer like Narasimha Rao got plaudits for economic reforms.
 
What did Modi 1.0 get famous for? Calling Pakistan’s nuclear bluff at Balakot? Sure, but little else. Everywhere Modi looks, he sees a stark landscape and humongous challenges. Pakistan showed us after Balakot that our military is antiquated; that even a practically bankrupt country like itself has better equipment than us. Defence procurement has been mired in mud during the Sonia Gandhi era and then again with Rafale during Modi 1.0.
 
The economy is even worse off than defence. Make in India proved to be just hype. What can India do to increase jobs? Manufacturing is always cited as the solution, but India has never been a manufacturing powerhouse. Trade with the US has taken a hit, taking along with it software jobs. It seems like a really bleak scenario, perhaps never as bleak as when before 1991. Can Sitharaman do a Manmohan Singh?

Foreign policy, and again India is jammed. The country has virtually no Afghan policy. Ties with the US have been hit because of trade. China continues to be unfriendly. Pakistan will self-implode but not do anything in India’s favour. The Russians are moving towards Pakistan. Traditional Muslim ally Iran has become wary because Modi has moved closer to its rivals, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. We are truly non-aligned today, that is we don’t seem to have any friends. Oh, how can you live in the world alone.

Modi definitely wants to leave a legacy a la Rajiv and Rao. He will let the Ram temple issue slide. The bhakt would once again have been had.

And then there is the uniform civil code. Triple talaq was an easy one, not just because it was so egregious, but also because so many Muslim countries, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, have banned it. But any further creep into Muslim personal rights and Muslims are going to resist. Strongly. What will Modi gain by needling a somewhat already restive population?

When 2024 rolls around, the troika of 370, Ram Mandir, and UCC will be trotted out once again. Why doesn’t the bhakt understand that his idols have feet of clay and are not going to do anything for him in any of these regards? Why does the base fall right for the tricks of the politicians? One time and each time.

It has come closely after the Supreme Court judgment on Ram temple at Ayodhya categorically stated that razing the mosque was a “criminal act”. These judgments are preceded by violence and lynchings in the name of gau raksha, and unrest owing to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. All of this has a huge bearing on the future direction of our secular democratic republic.
The Ayodhya dispute has been at the centre of Indian politics for over four decades. We are a religiously polarised nation today. But we never wanted to be a religion based nation in the first place. Ours is a land where people of diverse faiths and belief systems have coexisted for centuries.
We won independence from the British thanks to a democratic freedom struggle, in which women and men of all religious backgrounds participated equally. We, the people of India, gave ourselves the Constitution with its values of equality, justice, democracy, pluralism and equal opportunity to all. In our democracy all citizens are equal irrespective of faith, caste, gender, language.
Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, Maulana Azad and many other visionaries from the freedom struggle painstakingly laid the foundation of a plural and democratic nation. So, what went wrong? How did we reduce ourselves to being mere Hindus and Muslims?

Even as our society has been diverse and eclectic, forces of religious division and hatred have always existed amongst both Hindus and Muslims. The two nation theory was actively pursued by these forces. Jinnah wanted Pakistan and there were those who wanted a Hindu rashtra.
The outcome was a bloody Partition with loss of innocent lives and mindless violence. The Father of the Nation was assassinated because of his insistence on sarva dharma samabhava and Hindu-Muslim unity.
Most ordinary Indians wanted peace and prosperity then and they want it now, as well. Some elite Muslims, mainly from north India, migrated to Pakistan. The majority of Indian Muslims rejected the theocratic nation of Pakistan and stayed back in their own country. But the Hindu right still holds Indian Muslims responsible for the creation of Pakistan.
After Independence, even as we embarked on nation building through various development initiatives, communal politics continued to form the backdrop. The Congress brand of secularism translated into pandering to conservative Muslim leaders such as the Shahi Imam, or other such religious figures. This kind of secularism did not translate into better living conditions for Muslims who got marginalised politically, economically and socially.
On the other hand, this pandering to orthodox religious leaders gave rise to the “appeasement of Muslims” theory of BJP-RSS. On their part, even today they do not give tickets to Muslims in elections.
Congress appeasement of Muslim conservatives during the Shah Bano case helped RSS build up the Ram Janambhoomi movement. Thousands of lives were lost in the communal riots that followed countrywide. The Muslim masses paid a heavy price for this kind of politics and continued rigidity of the clergy. The women led movement against triple talaq was a refreshing change in recent years. It was supported by all except conservative clergy and so-called secular political parties.
Could the religious polarisation over Ayodhya have been avoided? It is no more relevant to talk about so-called archaeological evidence about a mosque or a temple originally existing at the disputed site. It is now only a matter of faith turned into majoritarian politics.
Back then in the 1980s, the Muslim leadership of Shahi Imam and Syed Shahabuddin should have conceded the birthplace of Lord Ram. They failed to do so. But that does not mean that those demanding a temple can freely raze the mosque. The courts have failed to provide justice in the matter.
Ordinary people have suffered for the follies of leaders. They have paid the price for divisive hate politics for too long. Collectively, we have paid a heavy price for politics of religious division through civic unrest and disturbances. We have witnessed several communal riots since Independence – Moradabad, Meerut, Bhagalpur, Nellie, Ahmedabad, Bhiwandi, Surat, Bombay, Muzaffarnagar, Delhi, the list is unending.
All Indians, including Muslims, want education, jobs, affordable housing, health services and an opportunity to flourish. Everybody wants safety and security to live and move freely. Everybody wants to enjoy individual freedoms without worrying about politics over places of worship. Nobody wants public discourse to be dominated by religious issues at the cost of real issues affecting people.
Indians are an eclectic mix of casual religiosity, agnosticism, spiritualism or even  secularism and deep religiosity. It does not mean that they hate those from other faith systems and want their subjugation. Our political parties need to understand this.
The PM talked about sabka saath, sabka vishwas. But we are yet to see any further movement on this count. Everybody is happy to see a Ram temple at Ayodhya. But it is not going to resolve the crisis faced by the nation on the economic front or the agrarian front.
We have seen a blatant attempt to falsely give a communal colour to the fight against Covid recently. Such politics is not going to lead India into the future. The CBI court verdict is a deeply ominous pointer for the future direction of our vibrant nation.

     (1)  History can not be forgotten, nor can it be swept under the carpet ... !! ... It is fact of life that we are Hindustanis, but we are also are Hindus and Muslims  ... !! ... No one can sweep the history under the carpet that Muslims are invaders ... and that the 1947 independence came at a heavy cost ... millions of Hindus were uprooted from their ancestral homes, were rendered refugees living on Railway platforms ... were butchered and sent in trains loads from Pakistan.

The Urban Muslims, the likes of Javed Akhtaar, Shabana Aazmi, Irfan Habib and company have a simple strategy to further that agenda... !! ... They work in the garb of being Atheists, leftist liberals ...  lecture the Hindus of India to smoke the pot of secularism, liberalism etc. while the Musalmaans under the leadership of the Mullahs would quietly press on with their agenda of capturing Hindustan, without firing a single bullet, by quietly increasing their population through whatever means ... !! ... They consider the revival of Hindu nationalism as a mortal threat... (3)  This author has mentioned the name of Baba Bhim Rao Ambedkar, the visionary ... !! ... she should also watch the videos on what opinion Ambedkar had on the Muslims, and exchange of population in a  post-partition Hindustan ...!! ... Alas, Nehru simply ignored his view ... and see the results today, 73 years later ... the demography of India is systematically being altered ... the future generations of Hindus are looking at the same threats of the 1947 bloody massacres again ...!! ...

"1616953270-113","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/9/?s=triple+talaq","Equality of judges outside the court rooms","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Outraged/equality-of-judges-outside-the-court-rooms/","Equality of judges outside the court rooms","August 30, 2018, 5:31 PM  IST","V Raghunathan","In recent times, the Indian judiciary has pronounced some very enlightened judgments such as right to privacy, triple talaq, ordinances to be placed before the legislature, invoking religion/caste for seeking vote amounting to corruption, turning arrests of the human-rights activists into house-arrest in the Maharashtra Police arrests case and many more. But just as one thought the higher judiciary was our saviour of the last resort, we have on hands a most jarring note in the Madras High Court’s fiat to NHAI to “Create exclusive lanes for VIPs, including sitting judges, at all toll plazas on national highways or face contempt of court proceedings” (TOI, August 30, 2018). While it is unclear whether the Madras High Court’s decree is only for High Court judges, or for District Court and Subordinate Court judges as well, coming from a constitutional body the order seems highly unfortunate, if not amounting to outright bullying with judicial muscle.
Apparently, according to the reports, the High Court is “embarrassed” that judges are being made to wait at the toll plazas for up to 15 minutes and being asked for identity documents!
It is difficult to see exactly what is embarrassing for a public servant about having to wait in queue alongside the public that he or she is supposed to serve, or why it should be embarrassing to present identity documents especially if one wishes to pass through the gate without having to pay the charges. Also, while we routinely wait for justice for over 15 years on average, why should the Justices find it too much to wait for 15 minutes for their turn on the toll gates?
It does not behove judges sworn to constitutional equality of all in the eyes of the judiciary to expect preferential treatment over others. If they find the present system too slow, surely they can ask for more FASTag lanes and use FASTag themselves, pre-paid by their courts? That would be a move that would not only be more evolved but also more widely useful and faster for all, and also help avoid any embarrassment to judges, altogether.
At another plane, one expects judges not merely to pay lip-service, but live up to the ideals of equality of all. Creating a divide between VIPs and non-VIPs in such a matter is only a step away psychologically from distinguishing VIPs from non-VIPS in the dispensation of justice, whether with respect to speed of justice delivered or the severity of the sentence pronounced.
One wonders if the High Court has not cleverly included the “VIPs” along with themselves for the dedicated toll gates, with an eye on enlisting their support for obvious reasons. But has the good Court spent a moment reflecting before issuing its fiat what it would cost the exchequer to provide a dedicated lane for a small fraction of the “VIP and sitting judges” population at the toll gates? Should it not concern the Court that if one of the six odd lanes on a toll gate is to be dedicated to a small minority of VIPS and SJs, the cost may be way too disproportionate in a poor country like ours? Besides, what are these lanes to be used for when no VIP or SJ is passing through the lane at any point in time? And if they can serve any lesser moral during such lean periods, what happens if a VIP or a SJ comes along just as the window is serving the lesser mortals? Would the toll operator be in contempt of court then?
If the Judges would like to avoid embarrassment of being demanded identification of their positions, nothing prevents them paying up like everybody else and then go claim it back at their Courts or wherever the VIPs are employed. Clearly, the source of their embarrassment is not the demand for identification, but their insistence on free passage. The Toll Operators pay their legitimate taxes, right? So why should they be loaded with further freeships in the name of VIPs and SJs?
If it is the demand for identification that has irked the High Court, let us recall the VIP culture of security guards conditioned into not stopping a white ambassador with a red light on top of the “VIP” vehicles which facilitated the Parliament attack by terrorists. Identifications or the lack of it can, and are, routinely misused.
Ours is a country of extremely high Power-Distance Index. The higher judiciary should work towards reducing this distance rather than increase it further by putting themselves above ordinary people in matters outside the courtroom.

This was before the invention of the internet. So, apart from many of my schoolmates thinking that all Indians worshipped ‘The Buddha’ (incorrect), mostly chose their spouses through arranged marriages (correct), and were still in awe of the British (what do you think?), they didn’t know much about Indians and their traditions.
With this beautiful blank slate to make cunning use of, I became an archetypal Indian in the small town of Whakatane.

‘Back home’, apparently, we all spoke English, played good football and were reasonably better than the average New Zealander in mathematics. When a classmate of mine asked whether the red thing my mother wore on her hair was blood, my inner Eric Hobsbawm was activated. I explained to her that in India, the tradition was for women to choose their husbands and once my mother chose my father, she drew blood from him and smeared a bit of it on her head every morning.
Sindoor was the constant reminder to my father whom he belonged to. My friend audibly gulped, but believed me. That sindoor explanation gave me the first glimpse of how it doesn’t really matter whether culture or a tradition is true or false, correct or incorrect. For the most part, it doesn’t involve being right or wrong at all. Culture, rooted in ‘tradition’ and people, is largely about acceptance, unacceptance and quiet practical tweaking. Wearing a sindoor or raising a glass of champagne or not depicting the human form in images is either accepted and becomes a tradition. Or it doesn’t.
Since I am indeed in an Eric Hobsbawm mood — The Age of Donald being literally a ghostwritten work that will hit post-industrial capitalist bookstores in your town soon — the most famously quoted example of an ‘invented tradition’ is mentioned by the historian in his and Terence Ranger’s book, The Invention of Tradition.
Hobsbawm showed that cultural symbols touted as ‘traditional’ such as the tartan cloth in kilts signifying different Scottish clans were a 19th-century Victorian invention. The invention wasn’t the tartan, of course, which existed well before the 19th century. What was new and passed off as age-old was each tartan pattern being linked to a clan. That’s also the basic recipe for inventing nations, whether Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s proto-Bharat Mata, or Walter Scott’s Scotland.
This is not to suggest that all traditions are cooked up. The cultural acceptance of public urination in India, for example, is — for the lack of another word — authentic. But once the idea of something being ‘traditional’ — drinking oneself silly on New Year’s Eve, dipping in a river during the Kumbh, not venturing out at night alone if you’re a woman, jumping traffic lights, supporting your nation no matter what is done in its name — sticks, it takes the form of a non-negotiable symbol around which people rally round to proclaim their regional, religious, class identities.
Scriptures, secular or religious, are cited to defend customs and traditions and this whole wide web opens up. Traditions, of course, change. Indian weddings have largely moved from serving guests in batches on banana leaves to buffets on plates without Occupy Wedding Halls protests. Online shopping has quietly disrupted the centuries-old tradition of going out to shop.
Paytm and other cashless transactions are nibbling at another tradition that is facing a bit more resistance. Culture is far more malleable when the change ‘happens from within’, practicalities unobtrusively brushing aside ‘age-old habits’. And it matters who challenges a tradition. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat asking CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury to stop smoking is likely to be seen as a ‘fascistic demand’.
Mrs Yechury asking him to won’t. The British didn’t make most of us switch from dhotis to trousers. So, would the sudden dam-burst demanding the permanent legalisation of jallikattu, the bull-grabbing ritual-‘sport’, in Tamil Nadu (legitimised by an Ordinance that lasts for six months) not have happened if along with other NGOs, the US-headquartered People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wasn’t part of the pro-ban group?
Hard to tell. But let’s just say this perceived attack against Tamil cultural sub-nationalism would not have ended up like the BJP trying to ban triple talaq or pass the Uniform Civil Code if there was no ‘foreign’ pressure to wreck ‘our culture’.
Pursuing a quieter debate on how to not harm the bull and prevent any cruelty to it can happen after this totem dance around Tamil culture subsides. Like my sindoor explanation, bull can be provided to firm up tradition. Bull can also be used to change it quietly.

One can also see a robust democracy in progress with the Law Commission of India putting out a questionnaire online and asking for the opinions of the citizens.  The questions cover all religions and are wide-ranging.
As usual, the clerics have started their usual stubborn tricks even down to threatening politicians of the ruling party with a subtle “things going bad” (read riots) if they persist with what they’re calling – interference in their personal religious laws which they insist guarantee them the right to practice their religion under the Constitution of India.

It is sad and pathetic to see the Muslim Personal Law Board being adamant about a practice which has been banned by 22 countries, including Pakistan.  One can only conclude that the clerics want to keep the Muslim women under their patriarchal power with a draconian, regressive practice and at the same time hold the entire country hostage by bringing up the spectre of communal riots and the right-wing nature of BJP.
Muslim women having faith in the secular Constitution of India have knocked on the doors of the highest court of the land and demanded that it protects them from this exploitative and oppressive practice.
At this crux of history, the clerics, with their hold over the Muslim community by imprisoning and poisoning the minds of the Ummah have even started manufacturing consent in favour of the triple talaq by galvanising local mosques to get signatures on pamphlets that are shifty and don’t give the full picture as was evident by the investigative reporting by Alok Bhatt.

When the victims of this barbaric, Damocles sword over all Muslim women are brought face to face with the likes of Kamal Farooqui of the AIMPLB on National TV, all they do is sympathize with them and go into obfuscating the whole issue. When told that the practice has no Quranic sanction or that it predates pre-Islamic Arabia they either do a melodrama of walking off the air or don’t listen or shout down the women lawyers and experts with ad hominem attacks.
The road to change is long and the bravery and courage of women who have taken on the clerics-politician nexus, a remnant of the dynastic rule of the 70s, 80s and 90s by the Indian National Congress, is commendable.  The triple talaq abolition could pave the way for the Uniform Civil Code eventually which is about one law for one country, unifying Indians in the fight against misogyny and injustice with a vision of a truly secular country leading in gender equality.
It is very important to understand why the clerics and especially the Muslim Personal Law Board is opposed to it. It comprises mostly of men and hence the need to bring in the devious optics of women supporting what keeps them in the medieval age.
The Holy Quran was sent to a pious and steadfast man who brought out a savage (jahalat) culture from darkness to light with the spiritual message. In his last sermon,  the Prophet (PBUH) reiterated the need to uphold the rights and dignity of women.  But considering the fledgling Muslim Ummah started bickering even when his body was being washed by his favorite companion after his demise,  one can see how much the testosterone-powered ambition of the clerics poisoned that beautiful divine message.
With their own interpretations and iron hold over the custody of the text,  jurisprudence, and its meanings, they have found a perfect way to keep the Muslim community enslaved. Add to that already fragile relationship of the Indian Muslims with the state since partition and you get a self-perpetuating oppressive system feeding itself of the vote bank politics of the dynastic political party.
In 2016,  there is not much room to hide all the obfuscating efforts or the trickery being applied to manipulate the public into believing all is hunky dory in the Muslim world.  With social media and the medium of television and radio,  nuanced discussions can be held about the future of the Indian Muslims and their status in a country that continues to disprove the two- nation theory that tore it into three states and continues to hammer at its integrity.

The Sachar Report (2005), a truly comprehensive report on the status of Muslims is a very revealing report and is often cited, quoted, used as a prop to show how much the state has lagged behind in uplifting the Indian Muslims. But let it also be drilled into the Indian Muslims’ minds that along with asking what the country has done for them, they also need to introspect and reflect what all they could do for the country and eventually their own communities. Pushing the clerics-politician mafia back, supporting the abolishing of regressive practices like the triple talaq, and participating in the discussion of the Uniform Civil Code is a start.
Let’s free ourselves of the poison of the clerics!

     it is upto muslim women to liberate themselves. task is obviously not easy but then reward is worth taking the trouble. muslim women should campaign door to door in order to galvanise support of all muslim women. use all communication platforms. do not leave this fight half way now that it has started. rest of the country (other than aimplb and clerics who are actually in minority) is with you....

Opposition parties too were busy hoping from one TV studio to another and hosting their own press meets to outline how last three years have been an utter failure. BJP party president Amit Shah though rather than being drawn into tu-tu main-main was on a three-day tour of Lakshadweep.
This archipelago with almost a complete Muslim population contributes just one Lok Sabha seat and has no legislative assembly. BJP does not get more than 500 votes on this seat and over years has not even been able to make any inroads here. Yet Amit Shah made it a part of his southern outreach tour.
With opposition is still busy in whataboutery asking loudly ‘what about’ crime and corruption in BJP ruled states or questioning EVMs, BJP is already campaigning for 2019. This new BJP team with PM Modi and party president Shah at the helm lives and breathes elections. And they want every seat to count for. Having cemented its position in Hindi heartland, Amit Shah is leaving no stone unturned to head south and emerge as a truly pan India party.
The reason for rampaging ride of this Ashwamegh since 2012 is that there are no Luv Kush to stop the horse. In three years if one had to pin down major achievement of BJP led government, it has to be its turning the electoral fray into a one-horse race with Modi well and truly at the helm. Apart from regularly trumpeting about one yojna after another, it also ensured that there is no opposition to speak of.

It is understandable for a ruling dispensation that came to power with a promise of turning things around, to go all out and be one up in this perception battle. They want to show they have delivered on their promise. But three years is a time in any government’s tenure when honeymoon period is more or less over. It is time when people start looking for results of policies announced in first year.
Job creation, reduced corruption, booming economy and an overall sense of national security are major promises that the Modi made in his quest for power. There have been so many instances where this government could have been pinned on these promises. But the opposition has just not been able to pick right issues and set the right discourse. From malfunctioning EVMs to demonetisation, no one knows what the stance of opposition is. From triple talaq to nationalism, BJP set the discourse and opposition fell prey to it. It either had no response to it or responded in a tone that suited Modi and Shah. Is there any opposition today to question the duo? That is a rhetorical question for entire opposition to answer.
Modi may have or have not met the expectation with which he rode to power. His foreign policy and handling of internal security still has question marks. But he has ensured that those questioning him have no face to do so. There is no doubt that he has emerged as the biggest political influencer in the country. And in this endeavour he has been helped by headless opposition that is yet to get its bearings in place. They are still battling with their own past baggage and their cries of ‘vendetta’ have had no takers.
Electoral victories too helped BJP in this perception battle. It knows nothing succeeds like success in politics. While adversaries have reservations about even sharing seats or zeroing in on a common leader, BJP has shown no such qualms and happily accepted members of other parties in its quest for power. In elections since 2014, major states where it has emerged victorious such as Assam, Goa, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Maharashtra or latest landslide in Uttar Pradesh, BJP has happily embraced members of other political parties. Many present BJP MLAs and ministers in these states were some of the most vocal critics of the party just weeks before elections. There is no reason to believe why many in South too will not switch sides too.
On one hand where BJP is aggressively looking to make electoral gains in unexplored political terrains such as Lakshadweep, on the other hand principal opposition Congress is forever delaying even its internal elections to elect its next president. Where the face of NDA dispensation is already smiling at voters from every hoarding, one doesn’t even know if it will be UPA or Congress alone fighting BJP in 2019.
While Modi and Shah have already hit the ground running in Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura, Kerala and Tamil Nadu where they have not done well ever, all one hears about is Rahul Gandhi holding closed door meetings with his handful MLAs to beat this juggernaut.
This is the 2012 moment in Indian politics where one knew who would win 2014 elections. The anti-incumbency had peaked and reverse counting for UPA 2 had started. The opposition had a strategy and a face. The groundswell was there for all of us to see. In 2017, one sees the same strategy and a clear face from ruling dispensation. It is still unabashedly chanting Ache din aane waale hai in Southern states slated for polls. A strong showing will ensure that momentum for 2019 is set and BJP can chant Modiji phir se aane waale hai. As for Congress, the story is still the same that one has been hearing since a decade – Rahul G aane waale hai.

     the choice of the respected scientist and apolitical abdul kalam as president  by the bjp when they were in power, was a brilliant choice. now let us examine the congress choices in recent times--- pratibha patil, pranab mukherjee . if you compare these nonentities with abdul kalam, one realises that no politician should ever be made a president as their lifelong achievements have been amassing wealth, power and prestige for themselves and their tainted families. look at other congress choices like fakhruddin ali ahmed, giani zail singh and k r narayanan. all of them were political appointees and did not adorn the post of president. the last two congress appointees as president were politically motivated and did not deserve the cit. let us hope that the bjp is able to appoint an inspiring president and not a runt of a man!...

"1616953822-239","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=triple+talaq","Triple talaq: Court doesn’t need to quote scripture","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/twinkle-twinkle/triple-talaq-court-doesnt-need-to-quote-scripture/","Triple talaq: Court doesn’t need to quote scripture","December 14, 2016, 3:59 PM  IST","Renuka Bisht","This week gender justice supporters have hailed the observations of the Allahabad High Court that: “Triple talaq is unconstitutional; it violates the rights of Muslim women. No personal law board is above the Constitution.”
Justice Suneet Kumar stated, “Personal law cannot be above the constitutional law.” 
To nobody’s surprise the All India Muslim Personal Law Board protested that, “The practice is a part of Islamic law. The personal law is an integral part of Islam and the two cannot be seen in isolation.” AIMPLB has stood resolute that the Muslim personal law falls under the fundamental right to practice religion and the courts have no role in it.
This has become a familiar dance by now. 
Still the hope is that by dribs and drabs we are moving to a broad social consensus that the freedom of a community cannot mean freedom for some of its members to oppress other members of the community. 
In no way should this position become confused with majoritarianism; the focus must remain on the fundamental right to equality. Or as Justice Kumar powerfully put it, “Personal law cannot be above the constitutional law.” 
However, the court also said, “It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim male enjoys, under the Quranic law, unbridled authority to liquidate the marriage. The Quran expressly forbids a man to seek pretext for divorcing his wife so long as she remains faithful and obedient to him.” It added, “If he abandons his wife or puts her away in simple caprice, he draws upon himself the divine anger, for the curse of God, said the Prophet, rests on him who repudiates his wife capriciously.” 
Here the question arises whether the court should be in the business of quoting scriptures or interpreting scriptures like the clerics. This does not really seem germane to the argument that constitutional law is sovereign. And perhaps it unnecessarily worsens the anxieties of the religious minority.

"1616953688-210","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","Mr Modi & his government- Democratic or autocratic?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/blunt-frank/mr-modi-his-government-democratic-or-autocratic/","Mr Modi & his government- Democratic or autocratic?","March 9, 2021, 1:41 PM  IST","Saroj Chadha","The current BJP government led by Mr Narendra Modi has often been termed as autocratic. Some from the opposition, media, liberals and social activists (henceforth called the Crony Club) have even termed Mr Modi as a dictator. Are they wrong or is it a frivolous charge? In principle a democratic government runs based on will of the majority. This majority will is espoused in the parliament through their elected representatives. 
If a ruling party has the required majority in parliament, then bills introduced by the government invariably pass muster. In that case what can the opposition do? In all likelihood it will not be able to block the passage of any bill as the democratic process itself ensures that if the ruling party has majority numbers, the bill will be passed. The other option available to the opposition and Crony club is to take to the streets and raise public opinion against the concerned bill. But that too normally does not succeed if the government of the day is firm and believes in what it is doing. Sometimes such meaningless and frivolous agitations can be counterproductive as they may invite public wrath. The anti-CAA and now the anti-farmer bills agitations are prime examples in this regard. 
This is not to say that there is no role for the opposition and members of the Crony club in a Democratic India. In fact, they have a very well-defined role to provide a constructive opposition and act as watch dogs of citizens over the doings of the government. The opposition is expected to study the nitty gritty of the bills with a view to ensure that any shortcomings or anti-people aspects are corrected. The role of other members of the Crony club is to do the same in public space to generate public opinion for or against the bills. 
This approach requires a detailed understanding of any bill tabled in the house, perhaps even better than the ruling party itself. Next it would require discussions and debates with the ruling party, both formal and informal. To do so, opposition and other critics would require to establish their credibility and view each issue on its merit. In short, the opposition and the Crony club have to support and compliment the government’s efforts or go against it depending on the merits and demerits of the issues involved. 
But if opposition’s only agenda is only to block and reject whatever the government does without going into the merits or demerits of the issue, then its role in the democratic process will be compromised and it may become redundant. The discussions and debates with the ruling party will be minimal and their credibility to influence any changes even lesser. Unfortunately, Indian political opposition and other members of the crony club have opted for the ‘block and reject mode’. That makes them mere bystanders as the BJP government, led by Mr Modi, goes about its task. So, when bill after bill is passed democratically, the Crony club still terms it as autocratic and dictatorial. 
This Crony club has still to come to terms with some landmark achievements of the government in and outside the parliament.  Abolition of Triple Talaq, Abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, resolving Ayodhya dispute, standing up to China, counter strikes against Pakistan on their own soil are some of government’s major achievements. Most of these were either political hot potatoes or demanded courage of conviction in favour of national interests. All past governments were devoid of both despite offering continual lip service highlighting the need for their resolution. In short most of the earlier governments, at times with even greater majority in the parliament than the present BJP government, just let things be. Minority appeasement, keeping Kashmir problem alive and compromising national interests by projecting India as a weak nation to further their selfish agendas were the main reasons for their inaction. 
Is there any doubt that Mr Modi and his government have followed democratic and judicial processes as laid down in our constitution to take such major decisions? If that be so why does the Crony club talk of autocracy or dictatorship? Is passing of a bill by majority vote in the parliament autocracy? Or is having a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha an evil that is justified as democracy when opposition is in power but is termed as autocracy when BJP is in power? Does the time spent on discussion of a bill in the parliament determine whether it was passed democratically or in an autocratic manner? If the highest court in the country gives a judgement in favour of the government, this club feels that judiciary was pressurized, but if it is against the government, they eulogize the same judiciary to no end. Does this not show a mindset problem of the Crony Club?
Debate is one of the more important aspects of any democracy and the opposition often accuses the BJP government of not holding enough of it. In fact, they go a step further and accuse Mr Modi of being authoritative and dictatorial in his approach. Sadly, in our democracy this debate has been limited, both qualitatively and quantitatively, not only in the parliament but in public spaces as well. The primary reasons for this are the poor quality of our law makers, obstructive attitude of the opposition, inability of the opposition to add numbers to their ranks in the parliament, selfish agendas and double standards of the Crony club members.
At the cost of heckling a lot of feathers, it may not be wrong to say that in a democracy the onus of engaging in a constructive debate lies with the opposition since they are the elected watch dogs who must ensure that checks and balance remain effective. The ruling party, after internal debates and discussions, will decide on issues that it would like to implement in the form of laws or rules. It is for the opposition to dissect the same, discuss meaningfully and then seek changes or amendments as needed before agreeing or disagreeing. The aim being to ensures that the country gets better, comprehensive and effective legislations that have been examined and discussed threadbare. 
But if the opposition decides on a single-minded policy of blocking and opposing everything that a government does, then obviously there is no debate. This one-dimensional stance ensures that there is no constructive contribution by the opposition on most issues. Government meanwhile cannot sit idle and therefore bills will pass muster through majority in their original form as deemed fit by the party in power. The reality is that while the government follows the democratic procedures, the opposition fails to honour its commitment of being a constructive opposition to the nation. Does such a situation allow the government to have its way? Perhaps it does and helps to the government to be ‘democratically autocratic’ at times.
This is the state of affairs in our democracy today where the contribution of the opposition is ZERO. They erroneously assume that everything was honky dowry before arrival of BJP (and Mr Modi) and will be so once again if BJP goes out of power. Unfortunately, they have either failed to gauge the mood of a resurgent India or deliberately overlook it. The net result is that the majority in the nation does not stand with them. With each passing election the opposition gets more marginalized – and therefore more frustrated. This is the sad truth today and it does not bode well for the nation. A democratic India needs a buoyant, strong and constructive opposition with a say in how the nation is run irrespective of which political party runs it.

     Whatever you have said in your long article is a clear reflection of your inner self that you are pro BJP and hence Modi govt. The true analysis of a govt should be on the basis of what it had done for the common man. If the common man of the country is without food, without employment without the basic necessities the govt is at fault. What is the use of doing such things that don't provide facilities to common man. The present govt has increased the rates of petrol and diesel, cooking gas and this has affected the whole market. It has become very difficult for the common man to make both ends meet. It appears as if the govt has forgotten the verydefinition of the democracy----"" The govt of the people, by the people and for the people. "" More over it is not ready to hear the voices of opposition calling them hate speeches. Why then this govt be not named autocratic. Umesh Saksena@ voices from within...

I recently had the experience of sitting next to a furious mullah in a TV studio. Don’t want government money for madrasas, he hollered, don’t want modern syllabus, don’t want to produce doctors or engineers, just want to produce more maulanas and it’s my right to do so. He was banging his fists on the table and was in quite a state as he saw his freedoms being curtailed.
Mullah saab is quite right in that like the Mormons or the Amish people in the US he has every right to do exactly what he wants and live in a separate universe – especially now that the right to privacy has been reinforced in a magnificent manner by the Supreme Court.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-91729"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/345-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""240"">Illustration: Ajit Ninan
What the mullah should not have is the right to legally impose his views on others but actually he does have this right via the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which has set itself up as the ‘sole spokesperson’ of the Muslim community. Founded in 1973, AIMPLB is a collection of clerics (with a few professionals thrown in) whose main purpose is to protect sharia law. Half its members are life members and ever since it compelled Congress to overturn the Shah Bano judgment in 1986, it’s grown in clout, even as it has created the ecosystem necessary to posit the argument of ‘appeasement’ of a particular community.
Yes, the mullahs have been appeased, even as the people they claim to speak for head downwards on every social and economic indicator. Yet on every matter involving Muslims, including the Ayodhya case, AIMPLB is there positing its views. Now that they have been defeated in the triple talaq matter it’s a good time to ask, on whose mandate does AIMPLB claim to speak for the world’s third largest Muslim community? Did they descend from the heavens to represent India’s unfortunate Muslims till eternity? And why can’t AIMPLB be disbanded and a more representative body created?
Although the triple talaq judgment disappoints in still upholding personal laws over fundamental rights, yet a process has begun where women can question men’s rights to determine laws. All the world religions have historically discriminated against women either on the basis of religious texts or social custom (after all Eve came from Adam’s rib, while virgins await men in paradise and till the last century it was acceptable in parts of India for women to burn themselves on their husband’s pyres). But the whole point of modern societies is equality before law, regardless of religion, caste or gender.
We in India have in theory given all citizens equal rights but in practice personal laws (not just those applicable to Muslims) have been the backdoor route to disempowering women in matters of marriage, divorce, rights over children and inheritance. And because we were a nation born in the bloodshed and chaos of the Partition, those at the helm of affairs have also had a deep neurosis involving the Muslim community. Somewhere down the line, Congress, the dominant party to shape India’s narrative till recently, appeared to have taken the path of auctioning out ‘secularism’ to clerics, naturally all men, who were then expected to deliver the Muslim ‘herd’ as a voter bloc.
It’s as if the great votaries of secularism could not dirty their hands by directly dealing with Muslims so they brought on the mullahs. Regional parties, most notably SP, BSP and TMC have taken this model of politics to the next level. The first two have been vanquished in the age of BJP while TMC is holding ground in Bengal – yet it is inevitable that its advocacy of conservative clerics will lead to a counter polarisation.
Although secularism actually means a separation of state and church, we have evolved something of a perversion in India where the clerics have used the cover of secularism to keep retrograde personal laws in place and thereby their own relevance intact. And it’s not all motivated by divine impulses: Control over a social group also ensures control over whatever resources are available, most notably in the Waqf properties that are reservoirs of corruption instead of being a resource to serve the poor in the community. If our secularism appears to have been virtually flattened by the organised assault of right wing nationalism, it’s because there was a serious structural flaw in it to begin with. Let’s admit that.
A few women have now given some oxygen to the Muslim identity that was being suffocated by the relentless presence of the mullah. This identity should always have been grounded in the reality of artisans and craftsmen who make beautiful things with their hands and in the great subcontinental reservoir of poetry and literature that questioned every structure and saw the mullah as an impediment to knowledge and liberation.
Even today we live in an age of neurosis, where some accuse the women who fought the case of being pawns in a larger conspiracy scripted by BJP. To such commentators i would only say liberate your minds and regardless of whether BJP set a bait or not, equality is always worth fighting for. It is also true that personal laws may not be the most pressing matter confronting the Muslim community, although any set of rules that disempowers women should always matter.
It’s good to see the self-appointed guardians of Islam put in their place. My mullah saab would still be fuming, but frankly, i don’t give a damn as he believes women must live at the mercy of men.

Election Commission must act strongly","January 30, 2020, 7:55 AM  IST","TOI Edit","While campaigning for Delhi assembly polls BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Verma expressed his ire for the Shaheen Bagh protesters – led by women, many of them senior citizens – in an extraordinary and outlandish fashion: He claimed they would enter houses of Delhi voters to “rape and kill”, unless voters plumped for BJP. This amounts to hate speech and incitement to violence; such speech must be barred by the Election Commission. Likewise, Union minister Anurag Thakur does not deserve to campaign further in these elections, as he invoked a violent slogan from pro-CAA rallies by chanting “Desh ke gaddaron ko” (Traitors of the country), egging on the crowd to complete the chant with “Goli maaron saalon ko” (Shoot the bastards). In this context, claiming that he did not himself demand that protesters be shot is a mere legalistic defence.
EC has issued a gentle reprimand by revoking their names from BJP’s “star campaigner” list. It only signifies that if the duo campaigns, then the individual candidates and not the party will pick up the tab for their electioneering expenses. Both Thakur and Verma were inciting violence and promoting enmity against Shaheen Bagh protesters, offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code. Without a strong deterrent, others will also try their hand at hate speech. Even bigger names like Amit Shah, Azam Khan, Yogi Adityanath and Mayawati were barred from past campaigns. So EC mustn’t hold back against Thakur/ Verma.
Moreover, the eagerness to deny agency to the Shaheen Bagh women isn’t becoming of BJP. While criminalising triple talaq, the party had claimed it was empowering Muslim women. Shaheen Bagh’s spirited recitation of the Constitution’s Preamble and celebrations of patriotism should be sweet music for those worrying about fissiparous tendencies. By targeting them, instead, BJP ends up sending the message that it will never accept them as part of the republic. It must reflect on whether this is the message it really wants to send to India’s Muslims, and whether it is good for the country.
Meanwhile, sedition cases are becoming the norm against those opposing government policies. Look no further than the Karnataka school play criticising CAA inviting a sedition case. BJP must reconnect with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s immensely successful ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ slogan, to which he later added ‘sabka vishwas’. It also falls upon institutions such as the EC and courts to uphold the framework and dignity of Indian democracy.

     Yet another one-sided nonsensical editorial. As if the Shaheenbag crowd is made of sadhus, sadhavis, and sants. What about Sharjeel Imam, or those who beat up a media person, or the likes of MS Aiyar? You kept quite on these folks but identified two BJP guys to highlight in your daily dose of anti-CAA editorials/articles? What about the obstruction and nuisance these Shaheenbagis are causing and for what? Just their hatred for Hindus? You are essentially promoting hatred for Hindus, plain and simple. When someone says ""Goli maaron gaddaron ko"" why do you assume that they are Muslims? Also, Mr. Verma's comment about Muslims raping Delhites must be seen in the context of what is happening in Pakistan and what happened in J&K? Whenever the Muslims are in majority, they think that the women of the other communities belong to them and can be raped and plundered. Do you support that? Since you bring up women rights and triple talaq, if you have the guts, write an editorial on the evil practice of polygamy that is allowed legally in India to appease the Muslim men even when everyone knows that that is so demeaning to women and no other civilized country in the world allows that....

It was the 2014 general election. A humble ‘chaiwala’ dared to defy the most powerful dynasty and won by a landslide. It was unimaginable by any standards. The party in power with roots deeply entrenched in the system and with the entire establishment & eco-system firmly in their hands, was untouchable. But the people of the nation had made up their minds. The massive corruption and poor performance of the UPA government was rejected outright. The development agenda of the NDA alliance led by BJP was welcomed with open arms. When the verdict came, the NDA had a comfortable majority with 282 seats, acquired in the name of the most reputed ‘Brand Modi’. For the first time ever, in the history of independent India, a party other than Congress had won a simple majority on its own.
After that historic victory, Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept his word with the people of the country who had full faith in his promise of good governance. It was an impeccable corruption-free five year term. Infrastructure development that was not done in 70 years was now being accomplished at break neck speed. Demonitization broke the backbone of black money and corruption. The long overdue implementation of GST was systematically done. 100% village electrification was no small achievement. 10 crore toilets were built under the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’. Long pending demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans – the ‘One Rank One Pension’ was implemented. National security became the top priority. India gained more respect in the world than ever before. PM Modi’s dream of overall economic development of the underprivileged population turned into reality with ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan dhan Yojana’. The ambitious ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ successfully provided clean cooking fuel to 50 million women of BPL families. Perhaps, it would not be wrong to say that in five years, PM Modi achieved what the Congress didn’t achieve in sixty!
Having acquired so many feathers in their cap, once again, the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi went back to the people in 2019, this time armed with an A+ report card. ‘Phir ek baar, Modi sarkaar’ dominated the political scenario & PM Modi had won the heart and confidence of the entire nation with his model of good governance. The people of the country were convinced about his ‘neeti’ and ‘neeyat’ and showed their support by giving the Bharatiya Janata Party an even bigger victory this time in the 2019 general election for a second term in office with a one-sided mandate of 303 seats. ‘Janta Janardhan’ was damn sure about what they wanted.
As soon as he took the oath of office for a second time, the unstoppable Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up even bigger challenges and began working on important issues that had been kept simmering on the back burner for decades by every other government – The legislation on Triple Talaq, Dilution of Article 370 by scrapping of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and setting up a trust to build the Ram temple at Ayodhya as per the Supreme Court judgement – each one of these were extremely complicated issues that should have been simplified & sorted at the earliest. But the governments in power had been using them all along as tools in hand to fear monger and polarize their own vote banks, nation be damned. Over time, the issues only kept getting complicated further.
Taking these four gigantic reforms to their logical end within the first year of coming power is an achievement that neither the critics of the Bharatiya Janta Party nor their staunchest supporters could ever have imagined.
Triple Talaq
On 30th July 2019, the Parliament of India declared the practice of Triple Talaq as illegal, unconstitutional and made it a punishable act. Muslim women who had been denied legal parity with Hindu and Christian women for decades considered the passage of this bill as their personal victory. India will never forget the 1986 Shah Bano case where the Rajiv Gandhi led Congress government and Muslim clerics worked together to overturn a Supreme Court judgment. The same people who so brutally throttled Shah Bano’s self respect and the Indian Judiciary back then, once again tried their best to fear monger, portray the Triple Talaq bill as an anti-Muslim move and block it. But the Narendra Modi government did not allow vote bank politics to overpower long denied gender justice and finally the archaic and medieval practice of Triple Talaq has now been trashed.
Abrogation of Article 370 & 35A
In yet another phenomenal move, Article 370 – a long standing barrier between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and rest of India, was broken on 5th August 2019. It was beyond anyone’s imagination that the abrogation of Article 370 would happen within 100 days of the Modi government coming to power. This ‘temporary’ bill was not allowing Kashmiris to be part of the mainstream and had alienated them from India and the entire world. Kashmiris barely had any access to even the basic rights like healthcare and education. Cut off from the world, all they were exposed to was terror.
Along with Article 370, the revocation of Article 35A has been another big leap towards bringing Kashmir into the mainstream. Not only did Article 35A empower the state of Jammu and Kashmir to define ‘permanent residents’ in the state and accord special rights and privileges to them, it was also openly anti women and anti Dalit. Such a flawed bill did not deserve recognition in a secular democracy. The only people who opposed the abolition of this bill were those who had been milking the situation for years and had greatly benefitted from it politically. Abrogation of Article 370 will be recognized by our future generations as one of the most significant constitutional amendments in the history of independent India.
Ram Mandir at Ayodhya
If one has to mention the longest running, most controversial dispute in the history of India’s cultural, legal and political battles, it has got to be Ayodhya’s Shree Ram janmabhoomi – Babri Masjid land dispute. The first case in the Ayodhya title dispute was filed 134 years ago, way back in 1885. Since then, several law suits, writ petitions & verdicts came and went but were unable to quiver the historical and spiritual significance attached to Lord Ram and Ayodhya. For the 80% Hindu majority in India, Ram Mandir was not just a title suit, it was their cultural ethos, a matter of their faith.
It was an issue that should have been handled very delicately by the people in power but unfortunately they were looking at it only from a political angle to divide communities. The riots between Hindus and Muslims, that followed the Babri masjid demolition, led to the death of at least 2000 people. In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India confirmed that Babri Masjid was built on land where a ‘non-Islamic’ structure previously existed. Several other evidences to back that claim were presented in the highest court of law. Finally, the Supreme Court on 9th November 2019 ordered the entire disputed land to be handed over to a trust to build the Ram Mandir. The Supreme Court ordered to form this trust and a Board of Trustees within three months. It also ordered the government to give 5 acres of land inside Ayodhya city limits to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque. Had the Modi government not shown their will to patiently and very amicably take this complex issue to its logical conclusion, India would have still been bereft of it’s cultural identity.
Citizenship Amendment Act
The Citizenship Amendment Bill is about granting Indian Citizenship to persons belonging to the minority community – namely the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis & Christians, who have migrated to India after facing religious persecution in the three Islamic nations – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
The Citizenship Amendment Bill was a part of BJP’s manifesto since 2014. Infact, this bill was first tabled in 2016 and referred to a joint parliamentary committee that tabled it’s report in January 2019. But it had lapsed with the end of the 16th Lok Sabha’s tenure. After the formation of 17th Lok Sabha the bill was re-introduced and passed first in the Lok Sabha and subsequently in the Rajya Sabha. After receiving assent from the President of India, the bill assumed the status of an act and finally came into force on 10 January 2020.
The Citizenship Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. Interestingly, no one had protested the amendments then. Infact the CAA was then supported by the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and even the Left parties. But suddenly now the same people started fear mongering and portraying the bill as Anti-Muslim inspite of this bill not affecting the citizenship or rights of even a single Indian Muslim. Massive protests erupted across the nation by either the ill-informed or those who had vested interests, but the Government was firm. It is a matter of great concern that minorities in our neighbouring theocratic countries have borne brutal atrocities and faced persecution since decades, leaving them with no other option but to seek asylum in India. All three countries in question were essentially Islamic nations so the questions of Muslims facing persecution did not even arise. Those opposing the bill need to understand the difference between illegal immigrants and those who were seeking shelter as a last option. They must also understand that the citizenship status of every single Indian Muslim remains unchanged. By giving citizenship to those in genuine need, the Modi government has upheld an idea that is one of the key tenets of secularism – ‘Sarva Dharam Sambhav’.
At a time when India is going through a health crisis that the whole world is struggling to overcome, being governed by a leader who is handling this pandemic in the most efficient manner is comforting. Not only India, infact several world leaders have praised the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Viewing the Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity to achieve economic self-reliance, the Prime Minister has announced the ambitious ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, an economic package which works out to a whopping 10% of the GDP, making it amongst the largest in the world! From being a third world nation, India is steadily moving towards achieving self-reliance & self-sustainability.
And while the BJP is achieving one milestone after another and celebrating an eventful first year in office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, just like Arjun in Mahabharat, has his eyes firmly fixed on just one goal – Rashtra Pratham. Nation First!

"1616953322-126","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/9/?s=triple+talaq","What’s good for Haji Ali shrine must be good for Sabarimala too","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Swaminomics/whats-good-for-haji-ali-shrine-must-be-good-for-sabarimala-too/","What’s good for Haji Ali shrine must be good for Sabarimala too","October 27, 2018, 9:36 PM  IST","SA Aiyar","The Supreme Court order on admitting women to the Sabarimala Temple is being flouted by Hindu mobs. The Congress has joined with the BJP in backing the mob. If the Constitution and Supreme Court matter so little, is mob rule going to become the new political norm?
The Congress decries the lynch mobs that have killed Muslims accused of eating or trading in beef. Yet it backs the mob at Sabarimala. So, its opposition to beef lynching looks like a cynical political ploy rather than a matter of principle. If the party believes that Hindu religious feelings cannot trump the rule of law regarding beef, why not Sabarimala too?
The BJP accuses the Congress of pseudo-secularism on the ground of its Muslim appeasement, notably in the Shah Bano case. At Sabarimala, the Congress is guilty of Hindu appeasement. Either way, the once-proud secular party of Jawaharlal Nehru is now firmly pseudo-secular.
The notion that menstruating women are impure and polluting has no basis in the “scientific temper” that Nehru extolled as a philosophical goal. This is not just a Hindu problem. It is a problem in many faiths, including Islam and the Orthodox Christian Church.
Most mosques prohibit menstruating women from praying, and some prohibit even their entry. The famous Haji Ali shrine in Mumbai decided in 2011 to ban Muslim women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the dargah to lay flowers or chadors (sacred sheets) on the Sufi saint’s grave. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a courageous group of Muslim women activists led by Noorjehan Sadia Niaz and Zakia Soman, petitioned the courts saying their fundamental rights were being violated.
The dargah trust gave the Bombay high court a variety of specious reasons for imposing these restrictions on women. It said that the “free mixing” of men and women was discouraged in Islam, that menstruating women were unclean, and that it was a sin to allow women close to a male saint’s grave. It even alleged that women might “show their breasts” while bending over the grave, and that they wished to protect women from sexual harassment.
None of this explained why women had been allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the dargah from 1430 to 2011, albeit through a separate entrance. If for centuries women were not viewed as unclean trespassers on a sacred spot, how did this become an issue in 2011? If till then millions of Muslim women had visited the shrine without “showing their breasts” when bending down, and hence attracting male molesters, what caused the new concerns of the dargah trust in 2011? Was it a change in female dress fashions? Had see-through dupattas and kameezes become all the rage? Or had Muslim men suddenly become sex-crazy and uncontrollable in the dargah?
No, the objections of the trust were farcical. The Bombay high court quite rightly dismissed the objections of the dargah trust and said the inner sanctum should be open to women. The trust appealed to the Supreme Court, but got no relief.
Did the dargah or Muslim males in Mumbai form mobs to flout court orders, and keep women out, as at Sabarimala? No, despite much Muslim dismay and wailing about court intrusions into religious matters, the dargah implemented the court instruction on equal treatment of men and women. It created a separate entry path for women but allowed men and women equally into the sanctum. It built a railing keeping both male and female worshippers some distance from the grave itself. Marvel of marvels, Muslim women did not show their breasts, and Muslim men did not leap on them. Peace and harmony returned to the dargah.
In Swaminomics last week, I pointed out that the BJP had hailed the Supreme Court ban on instant triple talaq as a great victory for women’s rights. Why then did it oppose women’s rights at Sabarimala? Did only Muslim women have rights, not Hindu women?
Some angry Hindus responded that there could be no comparison. They said the issues in triple talaq and Sabarimala were so totally different that it was ridiculous to compare them.
Very good. This column now makes a comparison that is surely valid. In both the Haji Ali and Sabarimala cases, the issue was whether religious traditions on the pollution of holy places by supposedly impure menstruating women could negate their constitutional fundamental rights. In both cases, the Supreme Court said no. Its stance was logical and consistent. That cannot be said of either the BJP or Congress.

"1616953981-275","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=triple+talaq","Why making instant triple talaq an offence is no empowerment of Muslim women","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/behind-the-veil/why-making-triple-talaq-an-offence-is-no-empowerment-of-muslim-women/","Why making instant triple talaq an offence is no empowerment of Muslim women","September 26, 2018, 4:48 PM  IST","Samiya Latief","The Modi government cleared an ordinance on instant triple talaq last week which was quickly referred to as the “greatest reform for the empowerment of Indian Muslim women”.
Welcoming the move, most of the liberal “experts” on Islamic jurisprudence said that the woes of Muslim women in India are over now. But can we first care to understand what triple talaq is and why it needs to go? For that, we need to go beyond the usual dramatic “talaq, talaq, talaq” that is often talked about.
Under Islamic jurisprudence, marriage is purely a contract between a husband and a wife, which outlines their rights and responsibilities. Both parties are independent, though not necessarily equal, since Islam sometimes distinguishes the rights of men from those of women; for example, men can have up to four wives at a time while a woman can only have one husband at a time.
Any clause can be inserted into the contract of marriage, called nikahnama, through mutual consent as long as it is not contrary to law. To use the example of four marriages again, a woman can get a clause inserted into the nikahnama that the husband cannot take a second wife, and he has to adhere to the condition for the contract of marriage to remain valid.
Although getting (and staying) married is viewed positively, as family is considered the primary unit of a harmonious society, Islam does not view marriage as sacred like some other religions or belief systems. So the process of divorce is relatively uncomplicated in Islam, with both the husband and the wife having the right to divorce each other.
As per the legitimate process (in the light of Prophet Muhammad’s teachings), a man has to pronounce three talaqs spread evenly over a period of six months to divorce his wife. The waiting period of six months (idat) is to give the parties a chance to reconsider and reconcile, and also to establish the paternity of a child which might have been conceived previously. If the couple starts to have sex again, the slate of talaqs, so to say, is wiped clean. The right of a woman to divorce her husband is called khula, and she has to return the mahr (dower) at the time.
The point is, treating marriage simply as a contract between two parties and not as an unbreakable bond or a sacred union is as progressive as one can get, legally speaking, and there is hardly any scope of statutory improvement in such a process.
Yet, we see Muslim women getting the worse out of this deal all over. A significant majority has the faintest idea about their rights; they do not know that they have a right to divorce their husbands as well, or they can get their preferred clauses inserted into the contract.
Those who know are discouraged from actively participating in the drafting of the contract. Even in a place like Kashmir, which I feel is quite progressive in many ways when it comes to women and their rights, if a would-be-bride asks for changes in the contract, she would be looked down upon.
Fingers would be raised at her and the parents for such a demand on part of the woman because she is supposed to just sign the contract or in most cases say a “yes” without knowing what the nikanama reads or even looks like.
It is this ignorance and patriarchal set up of the society which allows bidah (incorrect innovations) like triple talaq to flourish. As has been reported, most triple talaq cases appear to happen over petty fights, including complaints that the wife “did not make the perfect roti”, did not “obey” her husband, “woke up late” etc. — and the husband, in a fit of anger, pronounces instant talaq. The woman’s family—both sides—mostly blame her for “provoking” the husband, not realising that the man misused his religion to belittle the woman. This is the opposite of what Islam permits.
What is needed, therefore, is not more laws, but a change in the attitude of society, which can only happen once more women are educated and more men sensitised about their rights. This should be the focus. Triple talaq is already illegal under Islamic law, its widespread practice is a sign of ignorance of law, not lack of it. Unfortunately, “banning” the already illegal triple talaq is a demonstration of more of the same.

The judgment, delivered by a 3:2 majority, ruled that triple talaq was open to ‘arbitrary and whimsical’ misuse and violated Muslim women’s constitutional right to equality.
Though two of the five judges recorded dissenting remarks – citing Article 25 of the Constitution which guarantees the fundamental right to religious freedom – it was deemed that triple talaq, whereby a man can divorce his wife by merely repeating the word ‘talaq’ three times, was not an integral part of Islam and as such could not be defended on the grounds of the liberty to follow the faith of one’s choice. Indeed, Islamic states like Pakistan and Bangladesh have abolished the practice.

The government is said to be unlikely to ban triple talaq, but in individual cases the matter can be taken up courts of law.
The SC ruling comes as a political plus point for the BJP government, and could prove to be a stepping stone to introducing a uniform civil code, which has long been on the lotus party’s agenda.
Even those who disagree with the BJP’s saffron ideology will agree that a common civil code, which doesn’t discriminate between religions, is not only appropriate but necessary in a polity which deems itself to be a secular republic.
While a consensus about a common code needs to evolve within the Muslim community, the debate should not be restricted to those of that particular faith but should involve all citizens of our diverse society which is bedrocked on the right to universal equality.
A common civil code is – or ought to be – above partisan politics. Because the right to equality is – or ought to be – common to us all, irrespective of faith or ideological hue.

"1616953531-172","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=triple+talaq","Ayodhya: Pragmatism Sanctified?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Citycitybangbang/ayodhya-pragmatism-sanctified/","Ayodhya: Pragmatism Sanctified?","November 11, 2019, 8:53 AM  IST","Santosh Desai","The Ayodhya judgment was much awaited and its potential fall-out much feared. While it is too early to assert anything definitive, the initial response to it has been quite muted. The reaction of the Sunni Waqf Board and leaders like Owaisi has been one of disappointment, but the tone has been carefully non-confrontational. The leaders of the ruling party have also striven to keep their reactions restrained and even their support base has, within the limitations of their capability, not gone overboard in their celebrations. Both these reactions could change in the next few days, but for now the aftermath of the conclusion of what has been the most contentious and thorny dispute spanning centuries, has been surprisingly mild.
What does this speak to? Is it a sign that the Supreme Court has managed the impossible- to actually arrive at a solution, that within the constraints of the problem, is a fair and balanced one that doles out a reasonable outcome for the parties involved? Or is simply a reflection of the political realities of the day, which is in many ways what this judgment is really a validation of? For what the judgment has ended up doing is to give legal sanction to a political reality. It acknowledges the asymmetry in power that exists between the two sides and arrives at a solution that delivers justice in the proportion that is in consonance with the politics of the day.
In many ways, despite the many sophisticated arguments that the judgment grapples with and the fine distinctions that it draws, where it lands appears to be in line implicitly with a more rudimentary and pragmatic form of reasoning. Hindus have an asymmetric investment in the site itself for they contend it is the birthplace of none other than Ram and hence insist that the temple be built ‘there’. A deep sense of historical injustice combined with the headiness of political power makes this emotional need a pressing one. Politically, given today’s context, they cannot be denied.
The key Muslim need is to avoid displacement. The place itself has meaning, but not in the way as it does for the other side. But the act of forceful displacement in the name of correcting a historical wrong, is not only the fount of innumerable such demands but an explicit acknowledgement of their subordinate status in the country. The fact that Babri Masjid has been the subject of repeated acts of vandalism including the destruction of the structure itself is a sign that these fears are not misplaced. Under this government, it has become clear that Muslim options are limited, which makes them more predisposed than ever before to accept a solution they deem sub-optimal as long as they get some form of redress.
The judgment ends up catering to both these emotional needs in a proportion that is politically pragmatic. The Hindus get the site, which is the real prize at stake, because the Muslim case cannot prove that it was exclusively used as a mosque, something that the other side is not asked to do. The Muslims get the solace of words, particularly when the judgment deems both the 1949 and the 1992 acts of vandalism as illegal (but is silent on what action to take against those responsible), and the compensatory action of an alternative (and larger) piece of land at a ‘prominent site’ in Ayodhya. The politically dominant side gets the spoils, but the other side is not humiliated.
In some ways, the judgment ends up delivering a notion of justice that has a touch of the communitarian about it, one that is based on the acknowledgment of the larger matrix of power within which a form of solution is meted out. Here, justice must be done, but within the bounds of the existing power equations. While its arguments are couched in judicial exactitude, its delivered essence is politically pragmatic, which is what makes it more easily acceptable.
The larger context is that there is a new political consensus that has emerged which ensures that no serious challenge would be mounted to any solution that is aligned with the dominant political narrative of the day. We see this beginning with triple talaq, where there was still some debate, to the abrogation of Article 370, where there was virtually none, to this judgment where again other political parties seem to have all adopted the let’s-respect-the-judgment-and-move-on line. Media, barring a few outposts, is a hysterically enthusiastic cheerleader for this consensus.
The fact that the judgment is unanimous is an important sign. For it serves to offer a sense of finality to the process. Not only is there consensus outside, but even within the court. No door has been left ajar, no window through which any new current can seep in. It frames the decision as the definitive view of India’s highest court and forecloses any further discussion. Overall, the sense created, is that of a choreographed act of pragmatism.
Does this judgment quell the anxieties that have haunted a significant section of the majority community and have powered the rise of the ruling party? While the court has been clear in reiterating that the door to any further disputes of kind has been firmly shut, will this indeed be the end of the project to reverse history? The statements emerging from the top leadership and in particular Mr Modi have been temperate, but will the BJP continue with this restrained line once it is election time? Has the time come for the party to take its dominance for granted and move on beyond issues that are fuelled by resentment, or is it politically infeasible for it to even think about that?
A new political reality has now been cemented and an emergent cultural impulse has been enshrined, now by the highest court in the land.

     Who ever debates or criticizes SC judgment on Ayodhya must first note that SC has repeatedly said that issue will be treated as property dispute  and not on the basis of faith.  1. This blogger has claimed waqf board was asked to produce evidence and other side was not asked to. This is absolutely wrong. Waqf board could not produce documentary evidence to prove that site belongs to them where as other side produced investigation report of ASI which amply proves that Masjid was built on a structure and not on vacant land. ASI also testified that structure beneath Masjid is not Islamic origin and it is a structure similar to temple. So the argument that other side not not asked to produce evidence does not hold water.  Then surprisingly even a retied judge is asking like this blogger that SC should have announced compensation and pronounce punishment for persons who demolished masjid in 1992. I am astonished how a EX judge can ask SC to pronounce verdict on its own awarding compensation and announcing punishment without giving opportunity to accused to put forth their defense. Further there is separate litigation before SC to decide these issues. These issues are outside the scope of present Ayodhya case. It is a great relief for whole country that 100 year dispute has been settled once for all. Who ever whatever high profile persons they may be stop finding faults in judgment outside court and also stop giving political colors to verdict. If they feel judgment is not satisfactory file review petition in court but stop provoking people who have graciously accepted judgment....  Read More

What is unconstitutional is not necessarily a crime. Suicide was decriminalised when the state realised the futility of penalising those attempting it. In contrast adultery, defamation, homosexuality still remain criminal offences – a situation that cries out for change if we are to move away from mai baap sarkar. The fetish for legislating on all aspects of human life contrasts starkly with government’s inability to scale up administration – a deadly combination that makes for poor governance.
There are personal matters like love, marriage, divorce, child custody and alimony where the state cannot enforce ethical or social mores; it is better off playing mediator through civil law and courts unless there is violence or intimidation. Many triple talaq incidents were reported after the Supreme Court judgment but this reveals a larger problem of stickiness of socio-religious practices. Sending husbands to jail can create perverse incentives for simply abandoning wives. Neither will wives and families be better off with the husband/ father in jail.
There are potential remedies in civil law that could have been explored like imposing a hefty alimony on such husbands. But civil recourse may not be sexy enough if there is a political imperative of being tough on Muslims. What is desirable cannot always be achieved through legislation, far less through legislation that appears excessive. The government is undermining its own case for a Uniform Civil Code, which is certainly worth implementing and is based on the premise that matters of marriage, divorce and inheritance are civil issues. It appears that the weight of mai baap sarkar still sits heavily on India’s political and legislative imagination, and it’s getting worse instead of better.

     Totally illogical arguments. Editorial is arguing for the sake of argument and just to oppose the govt. Triple talaq is banned by Supreme court. What deterrence exists for people who do not follow the Supreme court guideline? And if the person has already given talaq (that means he is not ready to continue the marriage), where is the question of his supporting the wife? Without deterence, this evil social practice cannot stop....  Read More

We have just elected the 17th Lok Sabha. Can we expect a more dynamic parliament as we head towards New India?
There are some encouraging signs: the average age of the 542 newly-elected Lok Sabha members is 54; 12% are below the age of 40; 267 are first-time MPs, and 230 were re-elected, affirming this vote for incumbency.
The number of women in this Lok Sabha is 78, or 14% of the total, 41 of them from the Bharatiya Janata Party. This is higher than any previous Lok Sabha, but we are still way behind other countries like Rwanda (61%), South Africa (43%), and even Bangladesh (21%).

The Women’s Reservation Bill, a.k.a. the Constitution 108th Amendment, which seeks to reserve 33% of seats in parliament and state legislatures for women, has been languishing in the Lok Sabha since 2008. It was promised by the BJP in its 2014 manifesto. Despite its majority in the last Lok Sabha the BJP did not try to get the bill passed, in contrast with the alacrity with which it pushed through the 10% reservation for poor upper castes earlier this year. The BJP has pledged again in its 2019 manifesto to get the bill passed.
The last Lok Sabha met fewer times than any other full-term lower house: 331 days compared with an average of 468 days. It worked for 1,615 hours, 40% less than the average of all full-term Lok Sabha. Still, it passed 133 bills, a third of which were discussed for more than three hours. But 46 bills lapsed, including the Triple Talaq and Consumer Protection bills, data from PRS Legislative Research shows.
More worryingly, the number of bills going to parliamentary committees for discussion and review has fallen drastically under the NDA. It is the sole discretion of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, in consultation with the concerned minister, to refer the bill to committee. The number of bills going to committee plunged to 25% in the 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19) from 71% in the 15th Lok Sabha. There are 24 standing committees; they summon witnesses and experts, and are typically non-partisan. There is no grand-standing. Usually the government accepts the committee’s recommendations on changes to the bill, so that there is broad consensus by the time the bill comes up for further readings, and then the vote.
Over its first term, the Modi government repealed a total of 1,420 outdated laws on our statute books. But, instead of debating important central legislation more democratically, parliament is over-legislating on matters on the Concurrent List. Legislation like Ayushman Bharat or land acquisition reforms ought to be set out centrally in skeletal form to be fleshed out by state assemblies.
The Goods and Services Tax, however, was a virtuous exception. Both the centre and the states have given up some financial autonomy to the GST Council; each state has equal representation, unlike in the Lok Sabha. Every GST decision so far has been by consensus, not by vote.
The most dangerous precedent the Modi government set was the important legislation, like the Aadhaar bill, that it slipped in under the guise of money bills, which are scarcely debated and avoid a vote in the Rajya Sabha where the NDA is still in minority.
For instance, the 2018-19 Budget of Rs 24.4 trillion was passed in the Lok Sabha without any debate. The Finance Bill after every Budget has become a carapace for legislation by stealth. In 2018, more than half of the 200-odd clauses of the Finance Bill had nothing to do with money matters. In 2017, as many as 40 amendments were tacked on to the finance Bill at the last minute; they included the shutting down or merger of a number of tribunals and removal of the cap on political donations.
Do the lawmakers we have just elected truly represent us? Nominally yes, but in reality they cannot really speak for their constituents or vote their consciences. M.R. Madhavan, President of PRS Legislative Research, told me the single biggest issue is the anti-defection law: “Once you have voted for the person, the MP has zero agency in representing you.” Why is this so?
The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, otherwise known as the anti-defection law, was enacted in 1985 by the Rajiv Gandhi government ostensibly to curb the Aaya Ram-Gaya Ram brand of political horse-trading. It gives the presiding officer of a legislature the power to disqualify a lawmaker if s/he voluntarily quits a party or defies the party leadership by either abstaining or dissenting on a vote.
Populist legislation like the UPA’s Right to Food Act or the NDA’s 10% reservations for poor upper castes ought to, but does not, have room for any dissent. MPs have to willy-nilly vote en bloc in line with the party whip. A party with a brute majority, like the BJP with its 303 seats, can push through legislation without internal debate. To put it bluntly, Parliament is reduced to a rubber stamp.
Madhavan suggests either repealing the anti-defection law, or restricting it to no-confidence motions or crucial votes where the stability of the government is at stake – and removing the Rajya Sabha from its purview. Will Modi make parliament truly democratic?

     for our times, the writer seems to be  digressing. Simply put - are our elected representatives even interested in doing good for the country? Most of them are only bickering and interested in scoring brownie points. The writer also seems to be taking potshots are the BJP - without mentioning the 50  years of disservice by the Congress. Lastly, what about the Media - which all the  establishments being owned by Business  Houses, is the Media truly reporting unbiased Views - I seriously doubt it!...

The extraordinary speed with which the #MeToo movement has spread is a tribute to globalisation. Within a year, societies around the world have become astonishingly comfortable in discussing social and emotional issues which earlier they had swept under a carpet.
In India it has led to the resignation of a minister, the loss of jobs and reputations of many powerful persons. There is a palpable change in the way women are beginning to perceive themselves. Surely, this is a milestone in our country’s history. The question is, how do we sustain this revolution?
Indian women have to thank Donald Trump who embraced a sexual swagger and his red-blooded masculinity alienated enough women in America to start the #MeToo movement. It has now raced to our shores, giving voice to dozens of Indian women, who were routinely groped and belittled. This has unleashed a wave of revulsion against a patriarchal vision of manhood. Some firms have already responded and asked women employees to come forward and speak up.

Yes, a few heads will roll; yes, a few innocent men will become victims in the crossfire; but this movement will come to nothing unless our society begins to learn to bring up boys differently. They will have to learn a different meaning of masculinity and a true understanding of ‘consent’.
Not long ago the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, outraged the nation with his cynical reaction to rape: “Boys will be boys!” he said. To his mind, boys earn their manhood by growing up to became warriors, traders and priests and compete for wealth and power. What matters is to be tough and successful. It did not occur to him that these masculine ambitions were grounded in a secure emotional life with a woman.
It will not be easy to undo patriarchal hierarchy and inequality which is nourished by Manusmriti with a deeply negative view of women’s strisvabhava, ‘biological nature’, that has to be tamed by stridharma, ‘duty to her family and society’. Manu believed that a woman is fickle and innately addicted to sensual enjoyment; so, she must be married off early and guarded closely. Since no man can guard a woman all the time, she must learn to guard herself by controlling her thoughts, feelings and acts. This is why inspiring stories of Sita and Savitri teach her stridharma and condition her to accept a subordinate place in a patriarchal society.
India’s public reckoning with sexual harassment is based on events that occurred a decade ago. Our minister of state, Pon Radhakrishnan, contemptuously called #MeToo a product of perverted minds and asked, “Why should we worry what we did in class 5?” The answer is that time is neither linear, nor clocklike; it’s not a measure of unchangeable and fixed moments. Marcel Proust, the French writer, explains that the memory of an event can be more real and powerful than the original, confused event. Remembrance takes us back to wellsprings of our being as past memories flow out, triggered by something in the present moment. They are more real than the toast we ate at breakfast this morning.
This is why we must not devalue the stories of women in the #MeToo movement just because the events happened years ago. It is for this reason that Justice Manohar, one of the authors of the landmark judgment governing behaviour in the workplace, has said that the Vishakha guidelines must incorporate incidents from the past.
#MeToo is not a men vs women issue. The last US election showed that women are not a monolith. More than half of white women voted for Donald Trump. By contrast more than 90% of black women, more than two-thirds of Hispanic women, and most Asian American women voted for Hillary Clinton. The lesson from America is for India’s young women to get politically involved. In America, the Pew Report states that a third of women have attended a political event or protest since the 2016 election. A record number of women (476) have filed to run for the House of Representatives. The more politics is infused with visible female role models in India, the more adolescent girls will display a sense of moral clarity.
We are just emerging from the nine day Navaratra festival, where the goddess Durga ultimately kills Mahishasura, who symbolises the forces of ignorance. As Ira Trivedi reminds us, #MeToo is also symbolic of that victory. The battle for justice for women is just beginning and there is a long road ahead. It is to Narendra Modi’s credit that he understood that the root cause of the problem lay in the way we bring up boys. In his Independence Day address a few years ago, he asked parents, why do we worry only about our daughters coming home late at night and not our sons?
Boys need to be taught many things early, including the boundary around a woman’s personal space that cannot be violated without permission. This will go a long way to create a better, safer working environment for women, which in turn will help our economy by improving one of the lowest women: men ratios in the world workplace. Meanwhile, let us salute both the women who have courageously come forward and the Supreme Court for its recent landmark judgments on privacy, triple talaq, decriminalising homosexuality and adultery – all these together constitute India’s age of enlightenment.

     Bringing up boys better is a long term project. Holding wayward men to account is an immediate priority. Very happy that a few scalps have already been claimed. The movement has been validated, has started on a strong note, should continue to blossom. To be fair, the media has been supportive in the initial phase. It will move on to other issues of the moment, but women should continue to speak up and change the culture at work places for the better....  Read More

Addressing a ‘maha parivartan’ rally in Bundelkhand, Modi asserted that government had a responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of Muslim women from practices that degrade their status in society. This comes after government’s recent opposition to triple talaq and polygamy among Muslims in the Supreme Court. It’s welcome that government has based its position on constitutional principles such as gender equality and secularism. Religious practices, no matter how intrinsically linked to tradition, can’t override the Constitution.
Plus, for far too long the Muslim community in India has been dominated by diktat from the clergy. And this happened because the country’s political leadership progressively ceded space to Muslim orthodoxy in the hope of reaping political dividends. This in turn has marginalised modern Muslim voices and relegated Muslim women to second-class status. Consider also that several Muslim-majority countries prohibit practices such as triple talaq and polygamy – Pakistan and Bangladesh don’t allow triple talaq while polygamy is prohibited in countries like Turkey and Turkmenistan.
That said, the Modi government can’t be selective in its approach. While Modi himself did try to balance his criticism of triple talaq by also condemning female foeticide prevalent among Hindus, this isn’t an exact comparison – though a major social problem, female foeticide isn’t a religious issue. If the aim is to strive for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) BJP must also revise its majoritarian positions on a gamut of issues, such as the beef ban being championed by several of its state governments, or building a Ram temple on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. Similarly, not cracking down hard on self-proclaimed gau rakshaks who go around dispensing their brand of vigilante justice, targeting mostly Muslims and Dalits, goes against the very spirit of a uniform code of governance if not a UCC.
For a common civil code needs to be based on secular considerations, not defer to the religious sentiments of one community while reading out constitutional principles to another. Majority appeasement is as much of a problem as minority appeasement. In practice, this will make resistance to a UCC difficult to overcome and even BJP will lack the appetite for it.

In your Vijayadashami speech in Nagpur, you spoke on whether women had the right to freely enter the Sabarimala temple. You said the faith and traditions of crores of devotees for centuries were ignored by the Supreme Court. You added that mere laws could never create a harmonious society, and decisions on matters of faith, taken without patiently creating a new social mindset, will “neither be adopted in practice nor create a new social order.”
Really? Then, logically, you should ask Narendra Modi to abolish the new law on triple talaq. After all, triple talaq too constituted the faith and tradition of crores of devotees for centuries, yet the Supreme Court ignored that. So, do you believe the Supreme Court verdict (and subsequent law) on triple talaq will “neither be adopted in practice nor create a new social order?”
Your party touts the abolition of triple talaq as a great BJP blow for women’s empowerment. You say the fundamental rights of women, enshrined in the Constitution, must triumph over Muslim traditions that have no place in an enlightened 21st century. I agree 100% with you. Surely, it follows that the fundamental rights of Hindu women must also triumph at Sabarimala.
No? Do you think that only Muslim women have fundamental rights and not Hindu women? If so, please explain. And if you want to treat Hindus and Muslims differently in gender matters, please clarify whether laws on sexual harassment should apply only to M J Akbar and not to R K Pachauri.
You would be correct in saying that new laws will not instantly change traditional beliefs and practices. Yet new laws do indeed have some immediate impact and push society in the right direction.
In 1951, the Constitution abolished discrimination based on caste, religion or gender. This offended, and went dead against, many traditions and beliefs of Hindus, Muslims and Christians. That did not deter the Constitution’s framers, including Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, founder of the Jan Sangh, which later morphed into the BJP. He would have told you that social transformation requires radical changes, even if they hurt traditional religious sentiments. That logic applies to both triple talaq and Sabarimala.
Has the Constitution succeeded in ending all forms of discrimination? No, these evils are still widespread. But the Constitution has helped greatly change the social mindset. The status of Dalits, backward castes, tribals and women has improved enormously (though not enough) since 1951. The reservations of seats in legislatures and panchayats, government jobs and educational seats for Dalits, tribals and backward castes is completely contrary to traditional Hindu practice, but has ended the historical monopoly of upper caste power. Much remains to be to be done in ending discrimination, but much has also been achieved. This vindicates the case for Supreme Court verdicts that uphold Constitutional norms against traditional religious practices.
Every religion has good and bad traditions. The elimination of bad traditions should be seen as an improvement, not an attack, on religious faith. Traditions have undergone huge transformations over time, for good reason. Despite what the Ramayana says, today nobody will advocate that the chastity of a woman should be tested by making her pass through fire. Despite what the Mahabharata relates, today nobody will espouse the right of an older brother to gamble his younger brothers and wife into slavery. This is not the dilution of Hinduism, but its evolution.
Bhagwatji, some accuse the RSS of religious fundamentalism, but I recognise it as a moderniser of Hinduism, although more flawed than the Arya Samaj or Brahmo Samaj. The old Sanatan Dharma viewed caste distinctions as fundamental. It viewed Dalits as untouchable, and tribals as “mlechhas”, barbarians outside Hindu society.
The RSS has, rightly, abandoned these traditional notions. It believes Hindus were weakened for centuries by such divisions, and so seeks to abolish the old distinctions to create a strong, united Hindu society. Despite internal contradictions, it seeks equal status for Dalits with other castes. Despite similar contradictions, it seeks the votes of women as equals. It rejects the concept of tribals as mlechhas, and seeks to integrate them fully into Hindu society. That is progress.
Bhagwatji, your own party has long demanded a Common Civil Code for people of all religions. Here again, I am 100% with you. But this Code will mean, by definition, the abolition of some traditional practices of all religions, and the creation of new universal norms. This will offend traditionalists of all religions. So what? Let’s do it regardless. And let it go far beyond triple talaq and female temple entry.

While most opposition party leaders have expressed their disapproval of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s abrupt demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, none of them, not even the Congress, has allowed their revolt to spill too far out of Parliament. Except Mamata Banerjee.
Since Modi made the announcement on the evening of November 8, the West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief went berserk, as if she wasn’t just outraged but, inexplicably, quaking in her famous hawai chappals.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-79165 size-full"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/didi.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/didi.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/didi-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">See! Another Gujarati man’s face on these notes!
After addressing a moderately attended meeting on her home turf, Kolkata, and a thinly attended one in the Capital, she surfaced in Lucknow last Tuesday to find that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had gone to the airport to receive her, ditched her at the rally. Instead of being present himself, he sent some junior ministers.
Speaking to the audience in a city famous for even minor occasions attracting public curiosity, the TMC chief gave her rusty Hindi a rhetorical edge by appealing to the crowd to leave Modi ‘votebandi’ because he has left them ‘notebandi’.
Banerjee’s next destination, Patna, was equally disappointing for her as Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, whom she called a “traitor”, has lent his support to the demonetisation drive, leaving his frenemy, Lalu Prasad Yadav, fuming yet paralysed.
Perhaps the high point of that visit was Banerjee hugging former Bihar chief minister and Lalu Yadav’s wife Rabri Devi. With active non-cooperation from the chief minister, it is doubtful if an ebullient audience was ever going to be waiting for Banerjee at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan. Except Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and a professional street protester like her, no opposition leader has overtly responded to Banerjee’s fraternising call.
Battleship Demonetisation
Though she was apoplectic at the demonetisation order from day one, what has fanned the fire is the victory of her party in a slew of parliamentary and assembly by-elections in the state. “People have revolted. This is symbolic. It is a vote against demonetisation. In a democracy, people vent their anger through votes,” she said.
But the TMC’s winning spree, which began in the 2009 parliamentary election, is continuing unabated. The by-poll victory is a continuous phenomenon as the state’s over-27 per cent Muslim voters, who had collectively decided since 2009 to discard the Left in south Bengal and the Congress in the Gangetic valley further up, and shift allegiance to the TMC, have not changed their decision. The game suits the BJP best as the more Banerjee gets identified with her minority supporters, the more votes get communally polarised.
The BJP is, in fact, the emerging force in Bengal, largely at the expense of the CPI(M). No wonder that in the political arena, Banerjee no longer sandbags the Marxists. She even calls up CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on occasions. The BJP is the new punchbag. Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who heads the empowered committee of state finance ministers on the goods and services tax, has given hints that he will leverage a rollback of demonetisation with support to Modi’s pet tax reform.
The TMC’s restlessness is linked to the party’s funding issues, which, again, are related to the abandon with which it violates the red line between welfare and sectarianism. But Banerjee, after coming to power, went bonkers when it came to drawing a line between the state and the church.
She offered imams and muezzins allowances from taxpayer money and began appearing in public functions with Muslim religious leaders wearing an abridged hijab. And thinking it will be electorally profitable to support the orthodox camp in the community, the TMC has decided to support the controversial practice of summary divorce through ‘triple talaq’.
It has boosted polarisation in a state marked by a long history of troublefree coexistence of Hindus and Muslims. Communal tension ran high in several areas of the state during Muharram-Dussehra. There were reports of clashes in four districts — Hooghly, North 24 Parganas, Malda and Paschim Medinipur — with homes torched, shops looted and hundreds of people migrating to ‘safe’ areas.
As the Sachar Committee reported in 2005, Muslims in Bengal are more marginalised than in Maharashtra or Kerala. While the social dynamic has worsened in the intervening years, organised groups of predominantly Muslim youngsters have been assimilated into the TMC’s criminal underbelly — involved in border smuggling of cattle, gold and drugs, trafficking in women and children and, in most transactions, using fake rupee notes as the currency of exchange at a discount decided by the perceived risk.
Cash Black Offer
At Kaliachak, in the border district of Malda, with about an 80 per cent Muslim population, the local market is labelled as the ‘fake note capital of India’.
With no industrial investment in the state, it is profit from illegal border trade that greases the wheel of the ruling party, the border gangs being protected in return.
It lends credence to CPI(M) MP Mohammed Salim’s allegation that “the ruling party in Bengal deals with raw cash”. Salim has cited the instance of the district cooperative bank at Raiganj in North Dinajpur — one of India’s poorest districts — witnessing deposits of Rs 46 crore in four days between November 9 and 13.
The demonetisation decision has certainly hit the unbanked poor very hard. But Banerjee’s howl may point to something injurious closer to the TMC bone.

The passage of a triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha and the reinstitution of pilgrimage rights for Muslim women are strong inclusive links in a chain that started within weeks of Modi taking office in 2014. Vivekananda famously described Muhammad as the Prophet of equality in race, caste, colour and gender. It took a disciple to remember that.
Gender emancipation was central to Vivekananda’s vision of a New India – a symbol of national regeneration that he placed into public discourse. “The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women,” said Vivekananda. “When woman is no longer oppressed,” he added during umpteen sermons, “she will become a lion.” He even wanted women to become partners in sacred space, a radical proposition in an age where priesthood had become the jealously guarded preserve of men. Analysing the past, he argued that India began to regress when women were turned into an “object of blame for everything”. In his cosmic and temporal view, the first manifestation of God was the hand that rocked the cradle.
The wheels of change set in motion by Modi in 2014 are on course towards a new horizon. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is a doctrine of inclusion, seeking to bring all those who are marginalised because of inherited problems like caste, creed, gender or wealth into the arc of prosperity and social liberation. ‘Sab’ does not merely include women; women are central to this narrative, which believes that they can play a decisive role in elimination of that historic curse, harsh poverty.

The starting point was Jan Dhan, the project that opened bank accounts for over 300 million people who had never seen the inside of a bank before. Jan Dhan minimised the role of middlemen with their sticky fingers in direct benefit transfers, an endemic problem that had substantially depleted actual resources meant for the impoverished.
A transformative element of Jan Dhan’s design was opening the banking system to women who had never seen the inside of a bank before. About 53% of the Jan Dhan accounts or over 162 million, were opened by women at the urban or rural base of the economic pyramid. For the first time women from Dalit, tribal and backward class communities who were struggling for a living, had found the means for an economic empowerment project whose full implications would become clear at next stage: collateral-free MUDRA loans.
Sensing opportunity and encouraged by government, women took an astonishing 75% of the total number of Mudra loans to start their own small enterprises, worth well over Rs 2 lakh crore. In the last two years, women of the poorest families also received another Rs 51,000 crore from the National Rural Livelihoods Mission. The PM’s housing plan for the impoverished has a trigger clause: a woman head of family can get a loan in her name. But a man must share ownership of the house with his wife, unless he is a widower or bachelor.
Schemes to improve the health and welfare of women have become signature landmarks of the Modi government. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has improved rural sanitation coverage from 71% to 93% while 1,472 cities have become Open Defecation Free. Separate toilets for girls are being built in all government schools. In his Independence Day speech of 2014, Modi startled the country by talking about the impact of absent toilets on women’s health.
Every pregnant woman and lactating mother (apart from those receiving help within the organised sector) now gets maternity benefits. This has the collateral advantage of persuading mothers to register births, leading to immunisation, life-saving vaccinations and better healthcare. The just amended Maternity Benefit Act extends maternity leave to 26 weeks, and ensures that every company with more than 50 employees has crèche facilities.
More than 3.12 crore indigent women have received free LPG connections, releasing them from the drudgery and danger of smoke-choked kitchens. This number will keep growing. Physical security of women is a major priority. Institutional mechanisms have been created like One Stop Centres; Nirbhaya Fund has been expanded; compensation for victims has been enhanced; railways is working to provide 24-hour security through CCTV at over 900 stations.
Government is pushing for more women in police forces to help victims of violence; eight states have ensured 33% reservation for women in police. A programme called Gender Champion to encourage gender sensitivity among the young is now part of the curriculum of 100 universities and 145 colleges. The PM has personally led the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao initiative, to address the child sex ratio and promote education for girls so that they can become equal claimants for jobs.
Justice for SC/STs and OBCs is another area where legislation, coupled with administrative action, works towards social justice and economic inclusion. The list of welfare schemes is long. Nor has government hesitated to take tough measures in the interest of the vulnerable.
Our social history is replete with division, along the familiar lines of caste and creed, which our colonial masters were quick to exploit. Unfortunately, this inheritance of ‘divide and rule’ seeped rather quickly after freedom into our democratic polity, encouraged by the first beneficiaries of political power. Gender remained what might be called the ‘silent division’. Modi is multiplying gender opportunity to end this comparative exclusion of women through social and economic empowerment.
Sometimes the meaning of a phrase acquires sharper clarity through the mirror image. The opposite of ‘divide and rule’ is, quite obviously, ‘unite and serve’. ‘Unite and serve’ is Modi’s mission statement.

     Once staunch supporter of Congress ideology  and now sitting on the quite other side  with BJP, Mr. M.J.Akbar conveniently forgets that it is this Modi who along with his SAFFRON gang is busy diving the society on the line of religion in a very big way through  tools like Yogi, Saxi Maharaj and number of such anarchists. It is this Modi who at the time of election puts every thing aside but incites furore over SMASAAN  and KABRASTAN It is this Modi whose right hand is Amit  Shah ,  the  criminal involved in fake encounters and extortion ,murder of Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bibi, exiled from his home state for such activities.  It is this Modi who turns blind eye on the corruption of Jay Shah, Anar Patel, rapes on woman of Nalia ,  atrocities on Una/Thangarh Dalits . It is this Modi whom Mr. Akbar is proudly praising for some petty thing things  Modi has performed  by allocating gas cylinders to poor woman. . But Mr. Akbar forgets to reffer demonetisation and implementation of GST that has been proved disastrous for the economy rendering  millions jobless , killing hundreds in the bank queues. Why Mr. Akbar forgets that he allowed Mr. Malya to escape safely,  Huge NPA of banks occured due to his favourite corporate houses,. Apart from all this now Modi's eyeing for hard earned  the bank deposits of common man. While praising Jan Dhan  Mr. Akbar again swiftly forgets that SBI has looted 1700  crore  Rupees of common man for not maintaining  minimum balance.Being the veteran journalist Mr. Akbar may be also knowing how much dirty tricks Modi and his gang has been adopting; vis. Gujarat LS election, promoting AYARAM GAYARAM tactics to win the seats. Is Mr. Akbar aware of the mess done by Ms Smriti Irani in the HRD ministry involving suicide of  Rohith Vemula, humiliation of noble laureate Amartya Sen.  Mr Akbar has highlighted a few good things done by Modi but as journalist  he ought to have critically pointed out blunders too of Modi.. And by not doing justice to his profession he sits on the side of paid media quite apart from Ravish Kumar. Further, Mr. Akbar might have also referred to the promises that Modi offered and  utter failure in fulfilment. Based on the promises only 1.25 billion people of this country elevated him to the PM post. Neither in Gujarat during his tenure as CM nor in the centre as PM he fulfilled even 10 % of the promises. This is a  demon liar cheating to the nation.....  Read More

Beauty that beholds you, beauty which has become a desire to possess to a point of conflict .
It all began during painful partition of India and Pakistan in the year 1947 .Three wars have been fought ever since for her and it remained the unfinished agenda of Pakistan. For us ,Kashmir is an integral part of India. The whole of it in its geographical entirety which includes PoK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir) regions including Gilgit – Baltistan and Aksai Chin (China occupied Kashmir) and our government is determined to take back every inch of it.
Ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, Jammu and Kashmir were acceded to India when Hari Singh signed J&K Instrument of Accession on 27 October 1947. Refugees from Pakistan be it Hindu or Sikh, Buddhists or Dalit had started migrating to India in millions.  Pandit Nehru in power did not allow them to settle in Jammu and Kashmir but other regions of Punjab,Delhi,Gujarat etc, for reasons best known to him. The State ever since remained a Muslim majority.
Deen Dayal ji once said, to secure a nation first step is to have mix population in border. The vision that remained ignored by successive governments in power.
Post Independence, all the princely states were invited to send representatives to India’s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, in May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments, which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.
In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State. Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution in 1954, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State’s constituent assembly. This was a “temporary provision” in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State’s constitution. However, the State’s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370, which according to Pandit Nehru, was suppose to fade away over a period of time but was ironically kept safe.
And the temporary continued.
Under the umbrella of Article 370, two three families flourished and the common people of Kashmir were pushed back to 18 th Century. The very provision which as they felt is ‘The connecting wire” burnt the common Kashmiris. It has kept the minorities, children, woman and Dalit deprived of the rights that citizens of India enjoy. All children of the age group of 6 to 14 years have the right to read but the children of Jammu and Kashmir do not. Child marriage is still rampant i/legal in Kashmir. The scenario is such that besides children, the youth has no good school or university to go. No investment is encouraged hence no Corporate set up is there leading to unemployment. The energies are diverted towards mischief, stone pelting leading to prospect of terrorism. Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs live in Jammu and Kashmir. Not forming minority commission there due to Article 370 became an injustice to minorities.
But as the saying is ‘The darkness is followed by Light”, this too has seen a new dawn of hope with Shri Narendra Modi coming back to power on 23May,2019.The ground work which began in 2014 came to fore on 6 th August,2019 when the government announced abrogation of Article 370,a fitting tribute to Dr.Shyama Prasad Mukherjee who sacrificed his life for the cause. A new Dawn where Constitution of J&K is replaced by Constitution of India.
While the Seculars are sulking, the average Kashmiri is celebrating the integration with mighty India. They too know where their security and benefits are. It is with democratic India and not at a place where they are just medium for settling scores. One would see the first ever Investment Conference coming up in October this year organized by CII (Confederation of Indian Industries) and Indian Business Leaders in J&amp;K bringing new projects, startups, technology and loads of opportunities for our Kashmiri brothers and sisters.
The first session of Parliament of Modi.2 government has been the most productive in the last 17 years where 32 bills have been passed and some of them were historic. The Triple Talaq law, strengthening of India’s anti-terror laws and the decision on Article 370 are all-unprecedented.  Especially, the abrogation of Article 370 which as per popular belief was untouchable has been dealt with Iron hand softly.
Notice the complete silence or indifference or implicit approval of foreign countries, including the big powers, over Modi Government’s action on Article 370,one will understand the magnitude of Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy success over the last five years. The only noise we are hearing now is from Pakistan .Remember, Kashmir is their unfinished agenda and ours too yet for we still have a huge territory occupied by them. Sadly one can change friends but not neighbors.
Back home people are needlessly intellectualizing abrogation of Article 370. There is this unhealthy obsession with para this, page that, sub-section this. Flogging a dead horse will not bring it back to life. A dead horse does not breathe. Article 370 is dead. A new Kashmir is born.

     We all pray for peace and calm to return to this beautiful land. The safe and honorable return - symbolic in several cases, for the Kashmiri Pandits are a talented people who have built new lives and careers for themselves elsewhere in India and abroad - of the KPs would be a message that the Valley is now safe, welcoming of people who come as tourists or socially responsible businessmen. 2. For thirty years, there has been continuing violence and loss of life. How best that can be ended is for the government to consider. A reduction in the security presence would mark the success of all that has been planned. Jammu and Kashmir could either be together or separate, but both deserve statehood. 3. For the entire state to be at peace and fully, emotionally accepting of the political status quo would create conditions for India and Pakistan to put seventy years of hostility behind them. The object of this submission is to underline the enormity of the task that lies ahead....  Read More

Stuck in their well-cemented positions, older players are unable to exploit the situation. However, new players like chief minister Arvind Kejriwal find it easier to experiment, learn and adapt. Did the latest Delhi elections and subsequent political events give us a glimpse into yet another shift in Kejriwal’s politics? What might be the reasons behind it? Should BJP be worried?
Kejriwal seems to be applying the method of “growth hacking” – popular in the internet marketing world where a company does rapid experimentation to find ways to grow fast – in politics. It has worked for him because AAP is a new venture and hardly consequential in most of the country.
Kejriwal started his political career from a neutral position of calling both BJP and Congress equally corrupt. This was his first experiment in politics. He maintained equidistance from both until he formed government in Delhi with the support of Congress. This second experiment was a major shift to the Left, that came with stronger opposition to BJP based on the familiar secular versus communal arguments. To gain votes and consolidate his position as a “secular” anti-BJP alternative, Kejriwal focussed on minority votes openly by meeting known communal elements in UP and Punjab. Nationalism was not even on his radar then.

The traditional “secular” political space that involves openly promoting minority interests – while ignoring or opposing issues dear to many Hindus – is crowded. Kejriwal lacks the organisational heft to muscle into the domains of the old guards. Obviously, the Left-liberal position put Kejriwal in a weaker situation compared to the older politicians running far bigger states. Further, this position did not weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was unlikely to take Kejriwal far in his national ambitions.
The Delhi elections provided Kejriwal another opportunity to reposition himself for national politics. While Modi’s success was the result of a carefully crafted strategy, and he has tried to consolidate his position by emphasising development and nationalism, the actions and utterances of some of his party colleagues and cadre are derailing his plans.
To the detriment of Modi and BJP, Modi’s position in people’s mind is shifting towards the right irrespective of reality. Modi’s actions concerning Article 370, triple talaq, and Ram mandir can be viewed as secular and nationalist. They can also be viewed with suspicion of being motivated by communalism. The strong Hindutvavadi cadre has ensured that the latter view prevails among large sections of the electorate. And this is where the opportunity lies that Kejriwal is trying to exploit now.
Recognising the drift in Modi’s position, Kejriwal has attempted to position himself as a development-oriented practising Hindu – a Hanuman bhakt – who is proud of his religion yet completely secular and a nationalist. In the elections, he avoided issues such as the Shaheen Bagh dharna that could create doubts about his new position.
His focus on development and his faith copied elements of Modi’s 2014 general election strategy. His recent utterances on China and his support to the Modi government on this issue, his views on Atmanirbhar Bharat and positive politics are aligned with his desired new position. Essentially, he is doing a Modi to Modi!
Kejriwal is ambitious and aspires to be PM someday. For that, he must appeal not only to the liberal Hindu voters but also to the minorities. This experiment of Kejriwal can create a perception where BJP looks closer to a strong Hindutva position than it is, and the so-called secular parties look closer to minorities than they are. It is the first serious attempt to delink the Left from liberal – a hyphenation that has always existed in independent India. And for him, the advantages could be huge and sustainable.
What can go wrong? Kejriwal has succeeded through experimentation so far because his party is young, small and entrepreneurial. However, as AAP becomes a national party, this strength can become a weakness. A strong position requires consistency of behaviour and expressions, and a disciplined cadre. Kejriwal must sharpen his strategy and implement it with precision and consistency to strengthen his position. His entire party must be disciplined in implementing the strategy. This is Kejriwal’s second chance to enter national politics. Will he do it right this time? Let us see.

     He has only flattered to deceive.  Corruption is no less under him.  His left leaning politics has detested his many middle class supporters.  His largesse and salary of 17000 to the Maulvis has completely blown the lid of his facade of secularism.  At best he can be a marginal player in national politics, replacing the dying Congress.  His election time gimmicks have exposed him as no better than the run of the mill politicians.  He has succeeded in single handedly destroying a fantastic people's movement of India against corruption all for personal aggrandisement....  Read More

The answer is NO. And that’s a fact, aptly proven, time and again. Look at all the speeches made by top BJP leaders for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections. Muslims have been used and abused in the name of vote bank politics. BJP needs Muslims more than it needs Hindus. For a party that credits itself with hardcore Hindutva, Muslims have been their best bet to win any election of any stature. Polarizing, creating a communal atmosphere between the two communities has been their forte. Without Muslims, they would have no one to thrash, lynch, put blame on, play the emotional card with the majority. Without Muslims, BJP is left empty-handed. It has no cow to milk here. 
From Ram Mandir to beef ban to triple talaq to abrogation of article 370 in J&K to CAA+NRC all of their so-called masterstrokes have been Muslim centric. A weapon to demonize them and a smart tactic to take the majority community for a ride. As political analysts say for the BJP it has never been a country’s economy or unemployment or education, for BJP it has always been about polarization, the hate culture and the obsession with Muslims. At any given opportunity you would find BJP leaders screaming out aloud against Muslims. 
Well, this is how it looks like for the past few years they were in power. I, for one had hopes from this government with an absolute majority. Education, employment, economic reforms were what one was looking at. A global superpower with bright shining youth with top of the class education, ready to take on the world. And what one got was gun-toting goons and an atmosphere full of bigotry, hate, and mistrust. Under-educated, unemployed depressed youth was easy prey for these politics of hate. Goli Maaro culture seems to have taken over and how. 
Every citizen and political party which keeps nations first must be concerned by the level of polarization that has taken place in India today. It is shameful, to use a particular community to get votes, pitch one against the other, divide. Sorry but such a deep, societal transformation rooted in pure animosity towards one particular community is not a healthy illustration of their absolute majority in parliament. 
Given the very vicious and very hostile atmosphere against Muslims in India, one can only hope and pray that good sense prevails. Hoping for a day where we, all of us, irrespective of our religions can work together towards nation building and make India a global super power. 
Jai Hind.

     If you introspect , you will find that ammunition to polarise Hindus is provided by Muslim Mullas who seem to control Muslim mindset and try to keep them glued to 8 th century and wrongly try to live in a reflected glory of à¤ à¤ à¥ à¤°à¤¾à¤ à¤¤à¤¾ ,outsider Muslim rulers. It's a fact that Muslim remained uneducated and bound to interpretation of Kiran provided by Mullas. Even well educated Muslims try to put their right or wrong ( illogical most of the time) arguments in light of Kuran. This should stop . The argument should stand on its own merit . Should be just for the Indian society. Muslims have been voting as a group , this power they understood from very early in electoral politics , even leading to partition. Majority which voted for partition stayed back. So doubts about their attitude  will be there. In fact they only encouraged those doubt. Not prepared to change is another road block in cohesiveness. In fact a cohesive society is enthama to Muslim clearly which still control the Muslim mind. Blaming BJP is not much of use here. Basically BJP is projected from very beginning as anti Muslim . BJP found it politically convinient to be pro Hindu and more pro it projected it was able to first time in history of India to polarise around 55% Hindus. Think if it is able to Garner another 5-10% of Hindus Nationwide , Muslim Mullas will be irrelevant for it . I think to bring in social changes in Muslims this external work will be required. Remember, Nehru- could bring changes in Hindu laws , against stiff opposition of conservatives, but got cold feet in the matter of Muslims. Today Muslim, have to be governed by modern laws, the Mullas control has to go ,if community can not , external forces have to step in. Madarsa education has to stop and modern education has to take its place. Another way of removing control of Mullas over the community is to forcefully stop Friday congregation in Masjids and yes Sunday congregation of Christens in churches . This will liberate both communities from the jaws of fundamentalist Mullas. In fact Hinduisation of Muslims  and christens is the way out. Not conversion .This will lead to more libral  cohesive society. The  forward looking , separate from regimented religion mentality ileader are  simply lacking in the community.  Most Mullas are antagonistic to any just change in the society. Now only external forces can force those changes. I see BJP taking up that role for betterment of Muslims and a unified society....

For those of us who still have secular stardust in our eyes, let’s recognise that secularism as practised in India has been reduced to electoral management, that first sees Muslims as a herd and then tries to keep that herd together.
It’s a vaguely insulting formulation, particularly as practitioners of the craft of secular politics have auctioned out the task of delivering the imaginary herd to a bunch of middlemen, all too often clerics or strongmen with criminal antecedents. It should be crystal clear by now that they repel others and have brought Indian Muslims to the point where candidates who presume to be the people’s representatives are unelectable and the community’s vote has been rendered ineffective.
The secular model currently offers no counter narrative to challenge Hindutva that claims to unite people above caste and region in a national symphony. All of this has been some time in the making. The clout of clerics increased ever since Congress famously capitulated before them when it overturned the Shah Bano judgment in 1986. This reinforced the “separateness” of Muslims and contributed to the rise of BJP in national politics.
The All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) was at the heart of that churning. Founded in 1973, it is a collection of clerics with a motley crew of professionals whose main purpose is to protect Sharia law. Half its members are life members who represent an orthodox male viewpoint, by default promoted by the state that swears by secularism, that actually means separation of religion and government. Frankly, the Ulema should have no complaint with Yogi Adityanath, the head of a religious order, occupying political office!
The same clerics also have their hand in managing Waqf properties that can be described as religious endowments made in the name of Allah for the benefit of the poor. There are approximately 3,00,000 registered Waqf properties in India on about four lakh acres of land (the second largest land holding after Indian railways). It is a national resource that should have been developed for the welfare of the community (the Sikh community is a model to emulate here).
Instead, many Waqf boards are repositories of corruption, both petty and large. Yet they get away with it because any demand for scrutiny is described as an attack on Islam.
It’s all rather pathetic. There is actually precious little that the Indian secular state has given the Muslim community except to ensure that they live for eternity in the museum of stereotypes, most notably that of the clerics who mostly talk rubbish when they showcase their views on television. The imagery of these men as “sole spokespersons” only works to counter mobilise. The community has slipped on all human development indices yet an entire mobilisation has thrived on the argument that they are appeased. It’s true, the clerics have indeed been appeased in a manner of speaking.
The real wealth of the Muslim community lies in its artisans, weavers and craftsmen who make both functional and beautiful things with their hands. It lies in the intellectual reservoirs of poetry and literature, in music and architecture. It is a real irony that over 200 years ago a poet such as Mirza Ghalib would mock the mullahs so relentlessly while we in contemporary India were doomed to take their views so seriously.
These elections have also exposed as a zero sum game the cynical mathematical model that works with the presumed value of the Muslim vote. Indeed, a politician such as Mayawati should recognise that her projection of the mullah-meat trader-muscleman candidates fitted communal stereotyping and hurt rather than helped a community she so grandiosely set out to represent. She spoke so incessantly of Muslims that a casual visitor to Uttar Pradesh during the elections could be forgiven for getting the impression that the state was voting to elect a minority CM!
Now that the shock of the verdict has registered some voices are beginning to express bitterness against the mullah-politician nexus. A process of introspection has begun and at the very least the community must recognise that in the narrative emerging in India their only utility lies as an image that is a caricature of the multiplicity of Muslim identities in India. No one will shed tears unless the change comes from within. Here are my humble suggestions for a manifesto for change:
* Tell the mullahs to restrict their activities to the masjid. Ban them (short of issuing a fatwa!) from appearing on TV. Be vocal about stating that you have different role models. Begin the process of examining the structures of law boards and Waqf boards, managed by groups of men guarding their turfs. Get professionals to create a genuine welfare structure for the community.
* Ask for participation in existing government schemes instead of harping on separate identity constitutional guarantees. Build campaigns over economic issues, jobs, small loans, education and not issues such as triple talaq. Yes, you will be baited but don’t fall into the many traps.
* Salvation lies in propagating the many cultural traditions that unite, not those that separate. Take on the conservative views on music, women’s right and freedoms. Highlight the pluralist traditions.
* If someone comes asking for votes on the basis of fear and tells you that Muslims are supposed to be in the frontline of the battle to save secularism, turn around and tell them in that case it may not really be worth saving.

These practices should go. That they go against the Quran, or that many Islamic countries have done away with 

them, is incidental. They must go because they violate democratic rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
In practice, the rights of Muslim women are being subverted in the name of rights guaranteed to minorities by the Constitution. In the past, the court has used the opportunity accorded by cases relating to divorce, alimony and maintenance for Muslim women to urge the government to move to a uniform civil code. Such directives have fallen on deaf ears and, on occasion, proved to be counterproductive — with the political and electoral calculations taking precedence.

The issue is not whether a religious community has the right to live by its holy laws but whether any community has the right to live by rules that subvert the rights guaranteed to every citizen in the Constitution.
The Constitution guarantees minority communities the right to freely practise and propagate their religion, own property and establish places of worship and run educational institutions. This constitutional protection draws strength from a framework of liberal democracy.
Practices that violate democratic rights weaken democracy and dilute the protection minorities derive from constitutional democracy.
It is for Parliament to enact or amend laws, but the Supreme Court determines if laws violate democratic rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The court needs to step up and say that the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act subverts the rights guaranteed to individuals.

And, it will, once the people are ready for it,” I explained to her and told her that the extent of criminality should and would, in time, be addressed, but moving beyond that and legislating on cultural norms was bordering on addressing personal laws which were held sacrosanct till date. “It’s an Elephant in the Room that someone will have to address,” I said. “Just give it time.”
A Common Civil Code that puts all on par where civil rights are concerned is one thing but Marital Rape is a tricky issue. Sex in a marriage and with the consent of a female below the age of 18 amounts to Rape. Now, in order to accommodate acts perpetrated by members of communities and groups wherein marriage was permitted as a Civil Act even when the female was below 18, the Rape Section provided a window. An exception clause to Section 375 of Indian Penal Code permitted sex by a man with his wife, not below 15.
However, over the years, in several cases, acts of sex with ‘minor’ females despite them being ‘lawfully wedded’ to the ‘culprits’ were questioned and categorised as acts of Rape. But, the exception in law stuck on paper.
That is till October 11th 2017 when India’s Supreme Court struck down the exception clause to Section 375 as ‘unconstitutional’. And, it’s a beginning: A step that should have been taken by the Legislature but one instead launched by a Judiciary armed with a new-fangled activism. After the stinging insult following the legendary Shah Bano case, when the judiciary had to eat humble pie owing to Legislative Intervention, the Supreme Court recently bolstered courage to adjudicate upon the Shayara Bano case wherein it struck down Instant Triple Talaq as being ‘Unconstitutional’.  The judgement was suggestive of the mood of the Apex Court.
And now, the Supreme Court has done it again. After months of campaigning, India’s Supreme Court has begun tackling the issue of Marital Rape, albeit piecemeal. The Apex Court struck down the exception clause to the Rape provision in the Indian Penal Code as ‘Unconstitutional’ and ruled sexual intercourse with a minor wife between 15 years and 18 years of age as ‘Rape’.
Despite earlier maintaining it did not wish to get into the domain of marital rape, an issue that bordered on breaching personal rights and religious codes, the Apex Court now proclaimed the age of consent is 18 years for a woman and that could not be whittled down.
The two-judge bench said that sexual intercourse with a wife between 15 years and 18 years amounts to rape. In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court relied on the Child Marriage Prohibition Act too to reach this conclusion.
It may be recalled that the Gujarat High Court had, in 2015 ruled that Prohibition of Child Marriage Act will apply to a Muslim person too while turning down the petition of a Yunush Shaikh, who had moved the High Court to quash an FIR registered against him. An FIR was registered against him for abduction and rape under the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He had eloped and married a 16-year-old girl in his neighbourhood.
In this case, Justice Pardhiwala relied on an earlier case in which on a conflict between any special law with personal law, a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court in the case of Seema Begaum vs. State of Karnataka had ruled:
An operative Act is the expression of the will of sovereign legislature; it overrides the consistent provisions of the existing personal law. The personal law has to submit to the statute law. The personal law cannot be repugnant, contrariant or derogatory to the statute.
When a later statute makes a contrary provision to the earlier statute, it has to be taken that the Parliament has intended the earlier statute to be repealed, though it may not have said so expressly. The same is in accordance with the   maxim Leges Posteriores Priores Contrarias Abrogant. (Later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws).
The statement of objects and reasons can be used for the limited purpose of understanding  the background and the   antecedent state of affairs leading up to the legislation. Reference to the statement of objects and reasons  is permissible  to understand  the surrounding  circumstances   which render the remedying of the evil a paramount requirement.
“Those who have not allowed to change the Muslim Personal Law have done a great disservice to the community…the members of the community have realised the evil consequences of getting a Muslim girl married at a tendered age of 16 or 17 years,” had ruled Justice JB Pardiwala in the order passed then.
In the Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India case, the Supreme Court had held polygamy can be superseded by the State just as it can prohibit human sacrifice or the practice of Sati in the interest of   public order. The personal law operates under the authority of   the legislation and not under any religion and, therefore, the personal law can always be superseded or supplemented by legislation.
This time around, the Supreme Court has expressly ruled that immunity cannot be granted to a husband having sexual intercourse with his wife in this age group. The Apex Court judgment is a huge step in the direction of criminalising Marital Rape, an issue that no political party wishes to address as it touches upon personal laws and risks hurting community sentiments by its far-reaching repercussions. In a stunning display of activism, the Supreme Court remains mum on the acts of marriage of minors under Personal Law but criminalises sex!
The Elephant in the Room has caught the Judiciary’s eye. And, now it will be tackled. Whether the people are ready for it or not is another issue, the Judiciary has made the first move.

In passing the Bill, Parliament has undone some of the injustice inflicted on Muslim women by restricting them to a personal law that denies them many rights.
Opportunistic politics had aggravated this injustice in 1986, when the law was amended to deny divorced Muslim women the right to maintenance. The present law should lead on to equality for women of all faiths in marriage, divorce and inheritance.
The legislation has two goals. First, it makes the practice of instant triple talaq, known as talaq-e-biddat, illegal and a cognisable offence, and, second, it gives divorced Muslim women the right to alimony and child support.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-124694"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-21.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-21.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-21-300x225.jpg 300w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-21-52x39.jpg 52w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
The legislation makes concrete the August 2017 ruling of the Supreme Court finding the practice of triple talaq to be against constitutional morality, the dignity of women, and principles of gender equality and equity guaranteed by the Constitution.
In keeping with the principles of equality, it extends the right to maintenance and support, of which Muslim women had been deprived in 1986.
The opposition to the Bill on the ground that it criminalises divorce, unlike in the case of non-Muslims, ignores the resistance to democratic norms raised on unsustainable theological grounds that frames the discourse.
Government should use this moment to build on the gains to address the gender inequities that persist in civil and personal laws across the board. It should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. This will lead to an honest national dialogue on a uniform civil code.

Like 1950 when Patel died, 1975 when Emergency was imposed, 1977 when Congress was defeated, 1984 when Indira was assassinated, 1991 when Rao-Manmohan liberated the economy, 1992 when Babri Masjid was demolished, 2011 when anti-corruption protests destroyed Congress, and 2014 when Narendra Modi stormed national politics, 2019 could be another breakwater year for India.
After winning a stupendous Lok Sabha victory holding his ground in all of North India and expanding BJP’s footprint in the East, Narendra Modi had all but stymied the opposition. The reprieve Congress achieved in winning three Hindi heartland states in late-2018 was all but nullified. Appointing Amit Shah as home minister set the ball rolling for the new government. The Modi-Shah duo threw caution to the winds in their daring abrogation of Article 370, bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir and taking away J&K’s statehood. The constitutionality of the legislative action has been challenged but Supreme Court is taking its own sweet time in hearing the petition. Meanwhile, by no stretch of imagination has normalcy returned to Kashmir. With few in the rest of India voicing concerns for the Valley and little public pressure on the government, there is no sign of change in Kashmir’s unfortunate status quo any time soon.
Having pushed such difficult sells like demonetisation, GST, electoral bonds, Article 370 nullification and triple talaq criminalisation without much protest, government appears to have moved on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill under the assumption that protests will be restricted to Assam and the North-East and some guarantees to indigenous communities would be enough to  soothe their anxieties. However, overconfidence appears to have got the better of the likes of Amit Shah who kept mooting a nationwide National Register of Citizens exercise.

(ANI Photo)
The disruptive potential of NRC became a talking point in universities, Muslim neighbourhoods and liberal cocoons. By the time protests erupted and government belated dialed back from NRC, the current National Population Register exercise was next on the public glare. The Citizenship Act rules framed in 2003 is clear that the NPR will lead to a “National Register of Indian Citizens” which will have a local counterpart, the “Local Register of Indian Citizens” at the sub-district/taluk level. Entries in this local register can be questioned by “anybody”. Apart from the hassle of proving parents place and date of birth given how poor documentation  was in earlier decades prepare for harassment by antagonistic neighbours, xenophobic politicians and an avaricious bureaucracy. Protests against NPR will also break out in coming days and BJP isn’t doing itself any favour by running #IndiaSupportsCAA campaigns when the discourse has moved well past CAA.
The brutal UP police violence on protesters in some districts have cowed down the protests. Time will tell whether UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has scored a political victory like Narendra Modi in 2002. Newspaper reports point to widespread support for the police action and CAA among Uttar Pradesh voters. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, now a shrewd politician with his ears to the ground, has also stayed uncharacteristically quiet. Apparently, he has also received counsel that taking strong positions could upset the erstwhile pro-BJP votebank in the city that has now gravitated to AAP.
Modi begins 2020 with four immediate challenges. BJP has lost two more state governments this year and several non-BJP governments are not on board with CAA. Many of these governments are yet to make their position clear on NPR and that could pose a serious Centre-State clash. Another problem is the economic slowdown which is eating into tax revenues. The Centre is running behind in settling the GST compensation dues to the states and they are increasingly becoming vocal about their financial difficulties. The third challenge will be diplomatic with Kashmir and CAA upsetting US Dems and countries like Saudi Arabia that Modi had assiduously wooed earlier this year. The last but not the least challenge are the leaderless protests that have kicked off. Managing these difficulties could consume much of Modi’s 2020.

Why do I not submit to the demand for triple talaq?
Hark back to 1984. The Sangh stands decimated, with only two seats in parliament. It is groping its way out of the dark, and comes across the decrepit Babri Masjid. It, principally the then-RSS favourite LK Advani, decides that it can hang its hat on the mosque.
A Hindu pride movement is launched. Sure enough, the tally in 1989 is a rich 89, a more than forty-fold increase. Handsome return on investment, eh? Guess we are on the right track. Then a Prime Minister, Chanakya-like in so many ways, either loses his nerve or has utter perfidy committed against him, depending upon whom you want to believe, and the mosque is torn down.
LK weeps with glee. Or was it sorrow? Again, depends upon what you want to believe. The Sangh surges into power, just, and then, firmly. An avuncular likable man leads the government, who keeps LK and his likes at bay.
The avuncular man steers clear of contentious topics: the masjid, uniform civil code and the like. He focuses on building roads and fostering relations with Pakistan. He lets my community be. Gujarat 2002 happens, the avuncular man wants to take corrective action, but LK stumps him. We are sad to see him go, well before his time was up.
The Archaeological Survey of India does a dash good job of maintaining Muslim monuments in the country. But in the rubble of as charged an issue as the Babri Masjid, the ASI claims to have found remnants of a Hindu temple or a Hindu king’s palace. That may be true.
The avuncular man had proposed moving the mosque brick by brick to an alternate site and rebuilding it there. We might have listened, except that more shrill voices arose asking for two more mosques, and if that hunger was satiated, we are sure that there would have been demands for many more mosques. We therefore refused the avuncular man’s offer.
History records that many mosques were built over Hindu temples. But those who believe in Hindu resurgence, do they ever reflect why Muslim invaders were able to rule uninterrupted for six hundred odd years. Were the Hindu kings clumsy in warfare? Were the Muslims stronger and braver? Why don’t they address these issues first as they seek to revitalize their culture?
Many Hindus tell us Muslims that we have a common ancestry. That is quite possibly true. But do they know why our Hindu ancestors converted to Islam? A key reason, among others, was to escape the horrors of the Hindu caste system. The caste system is as rigidly in place as it has been for thousands of years. Why don’t Hindus do away with it?
Forget intermarrying, why don’t so many caste Hindus not even dine with their outcastes? When Hindus point a finger at us to reform, don’t they realize that three fingers are staring at them in the face.
Chetan Bhagat lives a utopian dream where a temple and mosque will be built side by side, all in complete harmony. The situation is actually much more dystopian. Bhindranwale’s goons killed a lot of Hindus in the eighties, which led to Operation Bluestar, which led to the killing of a frail lady, which led to much Sikh blood being shed.
The train’s burning in Godhra 2002 should not have, but triggered the mayhem that followed. But 1992-93 was very different. As the mosque came tumbling down, we protested. The protests were peaceful for the most part, until violence took over.
1992-93 will go down in India as its worst pogrom, as well as its most unlamented. Culprits proudly admitted to their guilt, and became stronger and more respected than ever. No one could dare touch them, such was the fear they commanded.
Triple talaq is then like Babri Masjid: we fear that people will take an inch and grab a mile. After triple talaq, what? Abolish polygamy? Then other tenets of our faith until a uniform civil code is crept in by stealth?
Look at Tamil Nadu. And now Telangana. People say that we Muslims don’t want a modern education. But when we are given opportunities, we grab them. Eagerly. And live peacefully. The southern states are now the most prosperous in the country. And guess who is opposing reservations for us in Telangana? No prizes, it’s the Sangh.
It’s hard for us to reform based upon the diktats of those whom we firmly believe have a questionable past. We are told that we don’t want our girls educated. Take the Delhi Public School on Mathura Road. It lies near a Muslim locality. For years we have been sending our girls there, in huge numbers, to avail of a modern secular education.
How about reserving just two percent of seats in schools and colleges all over the country for Muslim girls? I can assure you that our girls will attend in droves even religious schools that preach a faith other than Islam.
And then these same girls will go on to become doctors, engineers, lawyers, pilots, military officers. Two percent really is not much to quibble over. And as these girls become strong and independent, practices like triple talaq will naturally lose their force.

     why 2% reservations in schools for muslim girls? no specific reason or reasons given. the argument about triple talaq and polygamy or even three places of worship is to say the least is simply lifted from deewar. not a real convincing argument. and if muslims really fear about 3000  mosque to be target of demolition, they should become wise and quickly negotiate across the political spectrum and some ethics thrown in , some satya, and some common sense to live in harmony with majority community. a community which has been made gulam for 1000 years . it is now that it is realising what has been done with it. agree there are lot and lot of problems with hindus. and they are slowly getting resolved. at least there is no going back on reforms in hindu community....

A host of questions and possibilities have been thrown by the events of this year, with variables multiplying as the year dragged its dying carcass to the finish line. How will the CAA/NRC/NPR issue pan out? Will the government will be able to ram its agenda through or will it retreat to fight another day? Will more decisive steps be taken on the journey to a full-fledged Hindu Rashtra? Will the new-found voice of protest that has sprung up all over the country be able to convert itself into something more lasting and meaningful? Will the judiciary intervene decisively or will run shy of confronting thorny issues? What will happen to the economy? Will the government begin to give it the priority it so badly needs? Will the media rediscover its spine? Barring the last question, the answer to which is a foregone conclusion, all the other questions have no clear answers.
In many ways, 2019 was the first year when the BJP government truly acted like a BJP government. Having perhaps decided that the first year of its term gave it the best opportunity to bring about the changes it truly desired, it has gone about executing its cultural agenda with speed and great resolve. The criminalisation of Triple Talaq, the virtual abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, and the passing of the CAA are all pieces that fit together and outline a clear trajectory of its intentions. If one could extrapolate from its current path, it would not be too difficult to foresee its script for 2020. The NPR/NRC, the Uniform Civil Code and the construction of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple are some of the other likely milestones. 
In following this path, it has simultaneously shown a level of disregard for the state of the economy that is difficult to understand. Barring a few superficial moves, it has allowed the economy to drift into a state of decline, and made its task that much harder for the rest of its term. Given that a lot of Mr Modi’s personal cachet has been built on the back of his reputation as an active agent of development, this disinterest in the economy has been particularly distressing for business, the constituency most optimistic about his tenure at one time.
If the government’s disproportionate focus on its cultural agenda to the detriment of the economy has been a surprise, so has the scale and intensity of the protests that have sprung up all over the country. In the past, none of the government’s actions have been seriously challenged. The large mandate enjoyed by the government coupled with the absence of any meaningful opposition had created a sense that it could do whatever it wanted. The profile of the people protesting went well beyond the usual smattering of well-meaning activists, and cut across class, town size and significantly religion. This was not a Muslim-only protest movement, and the active leadership of the young, both in several towns as well as in campuses across the country, was again something that was against the run of play. 
The government’s response has been two-fold. On the ground, it has come down heavily on the protests, particularly in Muslim-dominated areas, while on air it has made vague and not entirely comprehensible sounds suggesting a backdown. Police action has often been brutal and any number of videos documenting this are doing the rounds. It is clear that the police have been given the mandate to send a message and they are doing just that. Allegations of violence from the protestors’ side may well have a grain of truth in them, but the police response has been in line with what Yogi Adityanath termed as a desire for ‘revenge’. Besides, the state has discovered a new-found respect for public property, one that has been sorely in the absence in previous agitations. 
The way forward looks murky. If the BJP believes that the protests will die down in a while and that it can go ahead with its plans without too much disruption, then it may be in for a surprise. The stakes here are deeply asymmetrical. For one side it is a matter of existence and freedom and for the other, underlining of a symbolic distinction. Even if the protests were to become quieter, when the actual NRC is carried out, the situation is almost certain to become highly volatile. Also, regional parties in different states, even if they happen to be BJP allies, have not shown the appetite for handling the kind of fallout that is inevitable. 
On the other hand, it is possible that the NRC was always a red herring. Its purpose was never to be implemented but to be used as a polarising agent. If that is the case, then that plan might well work. At some stage sustained protests by Muslims will in all likelihood invite a reaction, particularly in small town North India. But unlike the earlier instances where the polarisation was largely of a controlled nature, this time around, there are chances that it will become a raging fire that could consume the country. There are signs that there is a New India, and it might not look like what the ruling party might have wished for. 
2020 is set up intriguingly, menacingly even. The gradual stifling of democratic institutions that has been in evidence over the last many years might reach a decisive point. The subjugation of the Muslim in India might become more official. The space for disagreement and dissent might shrink even more. Alternatively, the countervailing spirit of resistance might halt the government in its tracks. More practically, its lack of success in state politics and its inability to carry state governments along might slow down the government’s plans to push ahead with its cultural agenda. 2020 will determine the future direction this country will take. One way or another.

     1. This is an interesting view on the year gone by and what to expect from 2020. In this context, I find that views of Aditya Puri, MD of HDFC Bank are entirely different from views of some of our intellectuals and opposition leaders who are pessimists and whose reactions on subject of the current economic crisis appear to be biased and even immature. 2. When would these intellectuals and politicians look at the problems of economy as opportunity to set things in order? Is someone enjoying the economic slowdown? 3. Fact is that young citizen-voters of India have reposed faith in PM Narendra Modi once again in May 2019 Lok Sabha election. I wish leaders of Congress and other non-BJP parties accept this fact and offer a hand of cooperation to NDA government. I will go a step further and say that the opposition parties should demand implementation of much-needed fiscal/economic, administration, judicial system, police administration and election law reforms so that India can move forward....

"1616952996-49","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/13/?s=triple+talaq","Gujarat’s Muslim rehab sites: The cruelty within","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/true-lies/gujarats-muslim-rehab-sites-the-cruelty-within/","Gujarat’s Muslim rehab sites: The cruelty within","January 31, 2017, 6:45 PM  IST","Rajiv Shah","It was early 1970s, when I was sought to be navigated into Marxism-Leninism by my then “political mentor” and a senior student colleague, Sohail Hashmi. A total novice in politics, I was doing bachelors in English at Kirori Mal College, Delhi University, while he was in human geography. Impressed by his argumentative power, I would often look upon Hashmi – formerly very active with CPM, but now more into culture, heritage, and things similar – as one of those who would, very soon, trigger  a proletarian revolution in India, like Lenin and his colleagues did in Russia! While I don’t care to remember most of what Hashmi had taught me (perhaps he himself would have unlearned some of it), I still recall a seemingly academic argument he had advanced in order to prove how Hindus and Muslims faced similar exploitation.
This is what he told me, roughly: “Make a graph and draw two separate lines of class exploitation – one for Hindus, another for Muslims. You would find that both Hindu and Muslim working classes suffer similarly. There is no point in saying that the Muslim working classes face a higher degree of exploitation than their Hindu counterparts.” Presumably, he was referring to his immediate rivals in the non-CPM Left, particularly CPI and left-wing sections of the Congress, who would look at minorities as a homogenous group needing a higher degree of help than Hindus.
I don’t know if Hashmi sticks to his view now – it was, possibly, born out of the CPM-sponsored study circles for student activists of the Students Federation of India, then very active in Delhi University. Maybe it is for scholars to ascertain whether what Hashmi had told me holds true and how, but I was reminded of he told me while going through a just-released book, “Creating Spaces: Nurturing Leadership”, authored by Dr Uma Ramaswamy, released on January 28 at an Ahmedabad function presided over by well-known left-wing rural journalist P Sainath.
While the book tells the story of 30-year-old journey of Janvikas, an Ahmedabad-based non-government organization, most of which I have known from close quarters, including its work among the rehabilitation colonies set up following the 2002 Gujarat riots, what struck me most was how the poorer sections who live in in these colonies suffer at the hands of the Muslim elite, and also how Muslim women are at the receiving end within the community.
Calling those who were displaced due to riots (claimed to be 2 lakh in 2002, down to 50,000 now) internally-displaced persons (IDPs), a term coined by United Nations to identify those displaced as a result of violent social strife, the book quotes Hofeza Ujjaini, who is coordinating Janvikas’ work among Gujarat’s 69 rehabilitation sites, to say, “Currently, the most pressing issue of IDPs is housing ownership. Even religious trusts who earlier gave lands for housing are now reluctant to give housing rights. What is now being assured are their residential rights and not ownership rights which has brought much insecurity in the communities.”
A revealing statement, it coincides with an unpublished 2016 paper I had read recently. This paper makes an astounding revelation:  Even 14 years after the communal flare-up in Gujarat, about 3,000 families living in these rehabilitation colonies, formed mostly by Muslim NGOs, faced eviction. The paper, titled “Failing Act of Benevolence”, alleges, “These organizations have turned their backs on the people, refusing to entertain them”, adding, they are threatening them of eviction “if they raise their voice.” It adds, at certain places, the committees formed to overlook the welfare of the colonies have “turned hostile to the displaced people and have threatened the residents about losing their homes if they protested unnecessarily.”
The paper reports, “Out of the 83 colonies, only in 17 the houses are in the name of the residents. Availing, passport, pan card and aadhaar card becomes difficult for these residents as they do not have any document that certifies them as residents of these areas.” The paper – authored by Johanna Lokhande in association with Ujjaini –the organizations which have “turned their back” on the residents are some well-known all-India Islamic bodies and Muslim trusts operating from Hyderabad, Mumbai and Vadodara. Some of these are supported by builders.
A 2015 Gujarati language research work titled “Muslim Ghettoisation: Ek Karun Dastan” by Gujarat Vidyapeeth scholar Dr Damini Shah made a somewhat similar observation, saying the ghettoisation of Muslims following the 2002 Gujarat riots has led to a “shocking rise in religious obscurantism in the Muslim colonies, most of which were set up by Islamic NGOs in order to provide security to the riot victims.” Shah found that the dozen resettlement colonies she surveyed had “imposing mosques and madrasas attached to them, with all the necessary facilities”, in sharp contrast to the poor housing facilities in which the resettled Muslims live in sub-human conditions. She quotes maulvis of the mosques as saying that “the Muslims had to suffer in the 2002 riots they failed to properly pray to the Allah.”
The rise of obscurantism, obviously, leads to further oppression of women – another issue highlighted by Ramaswamy in the book. Even as claiming that Janvikas, post-Godhra, has helped women come out of their homes, join protests, and capacitated them, leading to a situation where a “critical mass of women leaders” have emerged, the book quotes one Nazima Pathan as saying, “Women who have come from different villages have lost a lot. Families that once lived in comfort are now confined in tiny settlements with no employment opportunities, resulting in domestic conflicts.”
Another woman, Janisar Shaikh, one of the “leaders”, says, while some women have become more vocal, things “should pick up momentum”, noting, “I see many elderly women who are single and deserted coming for help.” Reporting formation of “triple talaq committees” to fight the evil practice, the book says, Mahila Samajik Nyay Manch (MSNM), which works among the rehabilitation colonies in Aravalli and Sabarkantha districts, is faced with “the most important issue” women face – “domestic violence, and most importantly address the complex issue of ‘triple talaq’ that has been besieging women.” In fact, according to MSNM, says the book, “20 percent of women in these districts are made single because of ‘triple talaq’,” adding, “While violence against women has become an integral dimension of women’s lives across India, Muslim women are doubly burdened by the custom of ‘triple talaq’ that their personal law allows.”
Though I am not aware of any in-depth study about on Muslim women in Gujarat, a 2011 study by London-based group, Minority Rights Group International, London, has found similar “double burden” among Gujarat’s Dalit women. It says, the Dalit woman  “is at risk of becoming a victim of violence perpetrated by an outsider, but even more frequently by a member of her own community.”, adding, “She is at risk of becoming a victim of an unnatural death due to family discord. And she is at risk of turning to the criminal justice system for protection but finding little support and even less justice.”
The study, carried out with the help of well-known Dalit rights NGO Navsarjan Trust, records a total of 704 crimes against Dalit women by Dalits, of which 416 were cruelty by In-laws and 31 were Dowry Act crimes. Further, it adds, there were 288 crimes on Dalit women by Dalits who are not family members (grievous and non-grievous). The 288 crimes included 4 murders, 4 attempted murders, 12 rapes, 39 acts of outraging modesty and 16 cases of abetment to suicide.

Divorce, by itself, is not a problem – men and women are better off if they can easily free themselves from an unwanted or burdensome marriage. It is the terms of parting that must be fair, in terms of material security.
Triple talaq is instant, unilateral male repudiation leaving no room for negotiation or reconciliation. Outlawed in 22 Muslim-majority nations, it now has no legal force in India. It is true that social practices are not easy to extinguish by law (as the persistence of dowry, child marriage and domestic violence make clear), but what would Parliament achieve with a bill criminalising what is already illegal? It might serve to intimidate Muslim men but it doesn’t serve Muslim women’s welfare to have an estranged spouse in jail for three years, cutting off all support from him anyway. Criminalising may even be counterproductive, making women reluctant to report a pronouncement of triple talaq.
Muslim marriage is a civil contract, its dissolution should be civil too. In all of today’s din there’s also a danger of the tired and defeated image of divorced women getting entrenched. Quite to the contrary divorce can be liberating, and marriage something from which women are thrilled to break free. To be happily unmarried.

     Majority of muslim women are  either dependent on  family or husband for survival. How  divorce can be a freedom for these muslim women.  In developed world,  every divorce is followed by redistribution of husbands wealth and earning depending on  the period of  marriage   and  a compulsory  alimony and allowance for the kids till they are mature.  Don,t these women deserve the same?...  Read More

"1616953052-63","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/12/?s=triple+talaq","Hope is very much a strategy","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-commentary/hope-is-very-much-a-strategy/","Hope is very much a strategy","June 23, 2017, 11:02 PM  IST","Economic Times","By: M Muneer
Abraham Lincoln must be turning in his grave for not taking into consideration us Indians when he delivered those famous lines, “You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” For, what has the political class been doing to us since Independence?
Hope. It is a powerful emotion that can dramatically influence human behaviour. It is almost like faith, a confident trust in someone or something. It makes us aspire for more — like in Bollywood movies — for a better (even if implausible) future and drives us to dream and act.
Hope is a fabulous marketable commodity. It’s not a buzzword. It’s a real feeling of possibilities. People look towards politicians for hope, as well as to countries, social groups, families and religion.
Hope is not strategy is what experts say. But hope as a positioning strategy works eternally and is a trillion-dollar industry. Take the key positioning of most products and services. Soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, B-schools, lifestyle products, politicians. Remember the promises of roti, kapda aur makaan? Or the recent bijli-paani? Most leaders, once elected, simply forget about fulfilling that hope. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t.
He launched the demonetisation drivefor a seemingly impossible mission, with less-than-optimal execution: to rid the country of black money. Modi found a connection with the masses, for whom the idea of the rich suffering was hitched to a brand new hope.
And the reports of CEOs attributing poor results to demonetisation actually helped reinforce that hope.
That the Opposition failed to bust the myth of the ‘rich are miserable’ aggravated their failure in UP. Modi went further to achieve another impossibility: the abolition of beacons on official cars, the symbolism of VIP-ness. The strategic framework for managing hope has delivered results. Show the overall possibilities first. Follow them with the possibilities in the individual, and finally those in the process.
Then comes the second track: of aggrandising this craving, amplifying hope. This can be more tricky. What this involves is increasing the perceived importance of the outcome, and increasing the degree of its association with an acclamatory goal. It is worth looking at cow vigilantism or the triple talaq controversy through this lens.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-88817"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Baloon.png"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Baloon.png 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Baloon-300x225.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">Much more than just hot air
It may be to divert attention from the core issues — growing unemployment, deteriorating security, escalating cost of living, troubling non-performing assets, and poor execution of many flagship projects —so that the ‘craving’ gets boosted. Going by the strategic framework, Modi is likely to announce new schemes and mechanisms to reverse the effects. He will even deliver some promises to keep the hopes alive for the rest of his term as prime minister.
By following the two tracks, Modi will continue to retain the loyalty created via hope. Because of this, many will forgive below-expected performance. People will ignore, or rationalise, average-to-poor performance when hopes are high in a brand, person or outcome. More importantly, they need less persuasion then to be convinced further.
Herein lies the Catch-22 for the Opposition: damned if they oppose, damned if they don’t. The Opposition needs a better strategy than to steal the hope platform. Secular? Nah. Anti-Modi rhetoric? Nope. Demolishing the claims of the growth agenda? Maybe for diluting the hope platform, but not to bring in new hopes.
Instead of applying Newton’s third law to every NDA action, they should focus on the core ones driving optimismand try and demolish them. Without bringing disdain, they will not be able to build new hopes. Figurefudging issues is something that will find currency with the business community. A grand alliance is also unlikely to bring any new hope, as it is just a coalition of the same perceived corrupt and feudal set.
Does the Opposition have a clear vision that enhances hope? None was visible in the silence on cow vigilantism, anti-Muslim or Dalit outbreaks, triple talaq and so on. Instead, it could embrace a disruptive strategy that will damage the NDA’s hope strategy. There are three key traits that are the hallmarks of people who can instil hope in others: one, caring deeply about, and working for, people; two, having the focus on what is possible and matters most to people; three, speaking from the heart, a.k.a. ‘mann ki baat’. Modi ticks all these boxes. The writer is chief evangelist, Medici Institute

     i agree with m. muneer ,that the pm has developed the art of communicating &quot;hope &quot; to 125 crore people of india in such an effective way,that he is becoming stronger day by day further.am not going to justify that why this &quot;hope&quot; strategy is working the reasons for it etc etc.the other simplistic dimension is the 125 crores has observed they have given majority of the time to the others to rule the country.the poverty/literacy/communal environment/ basic infrastructure/water/sanitation/unemployment/electricity/inflation /per ca pita income being low  existed then &amp; now also.  they are convinced that such an huge country the changes cannot happen overnight,they how ever are convinced on the efforts being made take for eg the progress especially in electrification to all villages/solar energy/bank accounts for poor/cooking gas for the poorest of the poor etc etcdramatically the patience of the indian people have increased with their sour experiences of numbers of majority of years which others have govern.the masses are participating in the experiments by the government,take demonetization for example.somehow the masses are convinced that the &quot;corruption&quot; of the majority of the number of years which they have ruled,cannot be compensated in just 5 years &amp; which is why they are willing to give time till 2024.yes &quot;hope&quot;&quot; is well sold by pm i agree mr.muneer...

Revolutionary Socialist Party’s NK Premachandran has been appointed to Lok Sabha Speaker’s panel despite being his party’s only parliamentarian, a unique distinction. He speaks to Swati Mathur about it and the challenges faced by Congress, his political ally in Kerala:
You are the first from a single-member party to be appointed to the Speaker’s panel. How did that happen?
I was surprised when the Speaker asked me whether I was interested in chairing the House. I immediately responded in the affirmative because it is a big recognition, especially as it is not mandatory. Normally, parties are chosen on the basis of their strength and their nominees are approved by the Speaker. In my case, it was a suo motu decision on consideration of merit. I am grateful to the Speaker for recognising my contribution to the 16th Lok Sabha. I feel proud about being recognised for being a good parliamentarian.
You have been an extremely active member of the Lok Sabha, making interventions and introducing amendments.
I moved more than 2,000 amendments. However, none of them were accepted. That is why, in my opening speech in Parliament in the 17th Lok Sabha, in the PM’s presence, I said that none of the amendments moved by opposition members were being accepted by the government. This practice must change. In the Kerala state legislative assembly, where I was minister, if a constructive suggestion came from the opposition, it was weaved in. That is the purpose of making these rules. Why else should a Bill be put to discussion? Unfortunately, parliamentary practices don’t follow this. Here, we (opposition) only move amendments and the government kills them.
A lot of new MPs look up to you for help on parliamentary procedures.
I believe if you know the rules and procedures, the constitutional provisions, and conventions and precedents of the House, you will get ample chance to intervene.
Do you think the leadership crisis in Congress is affecting UPA floor strategy in Parliament?
Congress is in a transition period because Rahul Gandhi has resigned and a new leadership has to emerge. I feel they will emerge from this. Rahul, even though he is not holding the office of Congress president, has a say in Congress and he is the unanimously accepted leader of Congress from the grassroots level to the top. So, even though someone else is president, Rahul can do a lot of things. According to me, a collective leadership should emerge to fight a party (BJP) that has the backing of the Sangh Parivar, and a formidable and most modern political management. Also, my suggestion is that all secular democratic parties should have a common platform and good floor coordination on political issues. For this, Congress has to take the initiative.
Doesn’t not staking claim to the post of leader of opposition (LoP) represent a lost opportunity for the opposition?
The LoP post comes with some privileges and rights. If the LoP stands, the Speaker must give her a chance as per convention. The LoP represents the entire opposition. It is not the same as the Congress floor leader standing up for a chance to speak. There is no legal bar that says a certain number of MPs are needed to get the LoP post. In the past, CPM’s AK Gopalan was LoP when the party had very limited numbers. It only needs a direction by the Speaker. If BJP believes in parliamentary democracy and in an effective and active opposition, it should offer the LoP position to the single largest party. What is the harm in doing this? In democracy, the role of opposition is critical in making the government accountable to people.
Is that opportunity closed now?
I don’t think so. It can still be done. There is no time frame that governs the appointment of LoP. The LoP can be recognised at any time. All it needs is an announcement.
Why did you recently move a private member’s Bill on Sabarimala?
Sabarimala deals with the traditional faith of people in Kerala. Almost everyone who follows the faith did not accept the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala. During Lok Sabha elections, BJP president Amit Shah and other leaders said they would go to any extent to protect the rights of Ayyappa devotees. Why then are they not legislating on the subject now?
In the case of prevention of atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes, government filed a review petition in SC. Even in the Triple Talaq Bill, government issued three ordinances on the dissenting judge’s view. The majority judgment did not say a law was needed but the government relied on one dissenting opinion to issue three ordinances. Sabarimala too needs a legislation. As a part of UDF (United Democratic Front), we had a defined position on the Sabarimala that we stand with the devotees. That is why I moved the private member’s Bill.

     Why is this revolutionary worried about ""sangh parivar"". A revolutionary is basically terrorist. Why different yardstick for Congress without 10% seats? Is he too a chamcha

"1616954043-289","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=triple+talaq","Is the law banning ‘Triple Talaq’ a move in the right direction?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/igniting-flame-of-truth/is-the-law-banning-triple-talaq-a-move-in-the-right-direction/","Is the law banning ‘Triple Talaq’ a move in the right direction?","February 6, 2020, 3:50 PM  IST","Shikha Purohit","Last year, the Indian Parliament enacted a law banning instant Triple Talaq which was termed as historic by the government. It was celebrated as a giant move towards equality for Muslim women claiming that it ended inequality and indignity perpetrated against them by male authoritarianism. But does the law actually serve the purpose it was enacted for? 
The answer is an emphatic ‘No’. In the journey towards ensuring equal rights for women, this law is a move in the wrong direction. It is an archaic law which focuses primarily on protecting marriage for protecting the rights of women. Whereas the truth is that several times, and in cases involving instant Triple Talaq most of the times, marriage works as an instrumentality for inflicting discrimination against women. The law is based solely on the notion that women’s rights can be ensured only by preserving the wedlock she is tied in, however detrimental it may be to her life and personality. 
Continuance of a marital relationship devoid of affection and mutual respect harms a woman many times more than its unusual disruption. A man who arbitrarily and unilaterally breaks a marriage simply by pronouncing three words of Talaq for reasons ranging from some ridiculous ones like not cooking proper food to some despicable ones like giving birth to a girl child, clearly has no respect for his wife and to force her to remain in a wedlock with him in violation of her dignity. But still, women are reluctant to move out of such disgraceful relationship as they fear the financial insecurity and lack of societal support which usually flow from it. While men easily come out of a relation without any stigma attached to them, on the other hand, women have to undergo a hefty emotional and psychological trauma. 
Only a law addressing the underlying factors forcing women to continue in such marriages can suffice the purpose of achieving equality for Muslim women. Unfortunately, the present law fails on this count. Equality cannot be attained merely by prohibiting Talaq-e-Biddat. To get it we need a law which provides for equal rights of divorce to Muslim women. Instead of criminalizing triple talaq the government should have amended the Muslim Women Divorce Act, 1939 and provided that pronouncement of Talaq in one breath without following the Quranic procedure of reconciliation would amount to cruelty and the wife would have the right to seek divorce on this ground. Such provision would have laid the choice in wife’s hand either to condone her husband’s act or to take judicial recourse to get rid of him.

After chief minister Akhilesh Yadav emerged as the undisputed leader of Samajwadi Party and tied up with Congress, he appeared to have had an edge with two weeks to go before the polls. Has Akhilesh been able to ward off anti-incumbency and hold on to that advantage? Or is it the grossly under-estimated BSP that is emerging as the dark horse? As per reports from various journalists and keen election observers, the surprise package has been BJP which has somehow managed to stay in the race for top honours.

BJP’s campaign looked jaded just before the first phase of polling on February 11 as reports of the dominant Jat community siding with Chaudhary Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) started appearing. This phase was crucial to BJP’s scheme of things as they had done exceedingly well in the region during the 2014 general election. After the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, Jats had sided with BJP but the mood seemed to have changed in the past few weeks. BJP president Amit Shah held last-minute closed door meetings to appease Jat leaders. Party workers led a massive door-to-door campaign to regain lost ground despite being on a sticky wicket in the first two phases of polling in western UP. BJP seems to have done well in third and fourth phases especially in urban areas and cities like Lucknow, Kanpur and Allahabad.

So what is working in favour of BJP on the ground? The party’s strategy to aggressively woo non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits could be turning beneficial for BJP. Let’s talk about OBC politics in the state and imagine a scenario in a particular constituency where non-Yadav OBCs are unhappy with SP candidate. It is then that the chance of non-Yadav OBCs voting for BJP to register their protest becomes high. It is almost inconceivable for SP supporters to vote for BSP but they are not averse to voting for BJP. One can safely draw a similar correlation between non-Jatav BSP supporters who are unhappy with BSP candidates as well.

BJP has also stitched crucial alliances with smaller parties like the Kurmi based Apna Dal and Rajbhar dominated Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). The consolidation of Rajbhar votes can significantly tilt the balance in favour of BJP and its allies in over 50 of the 89 seats that will go polls in the last two phases. This could effectively put BJP in the driver’s seat in the race for Lucknow.

"1616953941-267","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=triple+talaq","Triple talaq bill: The first step towards upliftment of Muslim women","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/stepping-out/triple-talaq-bill-the-first-step-towards-upliftment-of-muslim-women/","Triple talaq bill: The first step towards upliftment of Muslim women","January 7, 2018, 8:30 PM  IST","Arshia Malik","The triple talaq bill is facing stiff resistance in the Indian Parliament both on technical and Constitutional grounds. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is already getting ready to contest it if it is passed. At the core of this national debate, polarisation and politics is Shaira Bano, the woman who took on the Muslim Personal Law by the horns and decided to seek justice, with a monumental judgement being awarded in her favour against the unfair practice of talaq-e-bidat (instant talaq).
The day the judgement came out, I picked up the phone to call my mother that day. We have not had an easy relationship for the greater part of my life, her having suffered a lot in a patriarchal setup on account of the rebellious me. But time has a way of settling down conflicts, whether personal or political and so there is an effort on her part to understand her grandchild and his upbringing, while all I have is compassion, patience and understanding. I am hoping the forgiveness is from her side as well, as it is from mine; for the deep wounds, we inflicted on each other’s psyche.
Mama likes to keep abreast of the happenings in the Muslim world, reconciling it with what she was taught, what she believes in and what she objects to. It is not easy to negotiate the usual pitfalls of her hatred for the Jews (Yahoodi), the Shias and the deep dislike for the kuffar (Hindus and everyone else who is not from the Muslim faith). It can be testing for my patience and calm when her conditioning manifests itself in the long tirades. But there is one common ground where she is an ally of mine – progressive Islam and reform.
A woman who, having suffered the abandonment of our father for 18 years, and not being a working woman herself (he forbade her to work when the opportunity presented itself in a Government Emporium), she was on fire and ice for the two years that I stayed home to breast feed my only child. I had chosen to leave my teaching job since private jobs were unregulated in those days and the only option for pregnant women was either to forgo their pay for the leave taken or resign. She was the one who brought me the application form of a new CBSE school which had started in the Valley, and she had many sleepless nights until my career relaunched.
She is the first person to understand what was happening with Shaira and as I revealed the case to her over the months, her enthusiasm piqued and she started rooting for her with a ferociousness I hadn’t seen in decades. There were tears, reminiscences, sighs, and shrugs in our conversations, and I knew she had somehow associated herself with the case as if she was fighting her own injustice of long ago.
In the politicisation and media circus of the bill being presented, many often forget the individuals at the heart of it. The way I observe the reactions within the Muslim community to it, or outside, from the Left, the Liberal circles, the orthodox, the centrists and so on, many don’t have the faintest idea of the kind of resistance Muslims have for reform. The triple talaq bill is just one aspect of sharia law which governs Indian Muslims through the Muslim Personal Law under the “secular” Constitution of India. Of course, things are a bit more complicated for Kashmiri women since we are governed by the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) as well, because of the Special Status accorded to us due to Article 370. What is revolutionary about the case being tried in court is that Muslim women, both the educated – aware and the unaware ones, the representative Muslim women groups and the fissures / conflicting voices within them, as well as the scores of women whom they claim to lead, are a part of this whole discourse challenging the mullahs and their interpretation and diktats of our religion.
Whether they are on social media, or not, the ordinary Muslim woman seeing Shaira Bano, Hadiya and Ishrat Jahan speak up their minds are getting exposed to something that has not been visible in our culture for a long time and was quashed whenever it made its presence felt – dissent. From Rabia of Basra to reformers in the West to these Eastern women, critical thinking and questioning, freedom of expression and dissent are not exactly encouraged. The men notwithstanding, it is the women themselves (those who carry water for Islamists) who will be the first to quash any rebellion, non-conformity, and critical stance, ones like my mother. All those years ago she preferred breaking her daughter’s will and shatter her self-esteem than trust her own blood and just listen. Like my mother, these women (outnumbering learned ones, articulate ones, moderate ones, aware ones) who just recite the text, without meaning, gulp in their social conditioning without question (the hatred for the Shia/Jews/kuffar) and resist any critical thinking free thinkers among them for fear of ostracism, and the embedded honour culture (badnaami, izzat, stigma) that debilitates any networking.
Even when these simple women undergo injustice, they never leave their faith, still trust the elders of the community, the Mohalla Committees (all men on the panels seldom women), and respect the mullah/imam / pir with a reverence bordering on the schizoid. It is these women who expect their faith to deliver justice to them everytime a man transgresses; these women know the Prophet’s last sermon by heart wherein he reiterated and advised the men to respect and take care of the women, and are ready to exercise their rights under whatever laws the Islamic jurisprudence decrees. Of course, there are reformers who have issues with unjust laws, which have lost their applications with time and under the practice/ culture of “Ijtihad” (striving, endeavour) they seek to change Islamic practices to more progressive ones. All this within the ambit of Constitutions, faith, culture, courts, legislation and grass root level activism. It can’t get any more democratic than this. Yes, democracy has loopholes and considering it is more like majoritarian politics, the zeal of the BJP to pass the law without discussion has not gone unnoticed. The Muslim groups will contest it and the whole discourse will move forward with its glitches, hiccups and hitches.
What is important for my mother (who never got any maintenance money for those 18 years and had to rely on the goodwill of her brothers and their wives) and me (we sisters decided that the best thing was to study and become financially independent, and repay the charity of uncles) is that she is coming around to see how her faith can be misused by misogynistic mullahs, to apologise for non-payment of alimony, abandonment due to having given birth to daughters, etc all because of the lop-sided representation in jurisprudence. She also sees why her daughter advocates for women imams, desegregated mosques, translation of the texts in all languages, and reform in Islam.
She will not stretch her understanding beyond this and we stop short of my stance on the hijab; the teaching of evolution in academic institutions; rediscovering and distribution of zindiq (heretic) literature like the Mutazalites, Jaddidists and others; and inter-caste, inter-faith marriages. It is an uneasy peace but rather this than the coldness between ourselves. She got a blow from another aspect of sharia when my husband died suddenly at the age of 41; which automatically disinherits my child and me from my husband’s property since my father-in-law is alive. Though I trust his goodwill, my mother in her simple way is relying on the embedded honour culture (shame) that would deter my father-in-law from doing anything against my child’s best interests.
I asked her if she wishes all these media, this technology, this connectivity had been there in 1992 when she walked out with two daughters, only their clothes on their backs and their school books after an altercation with our father. Her answer is not an immediate yes, it has come out slowly in months, a long drawn out affirmation. I understand her hesitation because all of our talks are just hindsight – we really don’t know what could or what could not have been, had all this awareness been present in an already insulated, conflict-ridden society still straddling its “unfinished business of Partition”  identity and the pull of the Ummah.
But for now, Shaira Bano’s case and its domino effect give us much to bond over, as the national debate rages on. Oh yes! Once reform is tasted there is always thirst for more.

"1616953274-114","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/9/?s=triple+talaq","Rights Activists champion victims of state neglect","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-commentary/sc-grounding-for-democracy-security-of-the-state-and-rights-of-vulnerable/","Rights Activists champion victims of state neglect","September 1, 2018, 6:37 AM  IST","T K Arun","The arrest of five rights activists by the Pune Police in different parts of the country, and the intervention by the Supreme Court defending the value of dissent and placing the activists in house arrest instead of police remand, have laid the ground for a much needed debate on democracy, security of the State, and rights of vulnerable sections of the population.
According to available data, most sections of Indian society have started to converge, in terms of social development — although at varying speeds and starting from varied states of deprivation. Only the tribal population stay outside this process, living for the most part, as victims of development as new mines, new roads, new power and steel plants come up on the land they used to occupy, displacing them to crowded clusters of poverty, debauchery and manifold exploitation.
Mainstream political parties have failed to take up their cause, depriving them of the redemptive fruits of competitive democratic politics that have improved the lot of scheduled castes, the minorities and other backward communities. Into that vacuum have stepped the Maoists, who preach violent overthrow of the State as the solution to tribal misery.
Extending the security and development reach of the State to tribal areas, implementing the Forest Rights Act in spirit to make tribal communities benefit from the development that takes place on land they have parted with for industrial or township projects to come up — this is the way to address tribal angst.
Instead, State focus is on putting down armed Maoists. Ordinary tribal people get caught in the crossfire. Their cause is taken up by activists such as Sudha Bharadwaj and the others arrested. Rights activists are not members of political parties.
They do not have organisation or money to back them, and constantly take on heavy odds as they confront local governments and the police. They are vulnerable, placed as they are in the matrix of power, but discharge a vital function of democracy, of subaltern defence against the might of the State.
If the relatively disempowered sections of society are repressed when they try to achieve the constitutional guarantee of equality — as dalits tend to be in most parts of the country — we would have not just an unjust society but also a society that breeds resentment, dysfunction and disruption that affects people who have nothing to do with repression or oppression.
This is why it is vital to understand public order not as defence of the status quo, but as one that accommodates the coming into being of a just society, reconfiguring existing power relations. The status quo in India is of highly unequal distribution of social, political and economic power. It can’t sustain in a democracy.
Attempts by those lower down in the power hierarchy to level things would be resented and resisted by their social superiors. The State machinery is supposed to pursue the constitutional goal of equality, but often gets recruited to the defence of the status quo.
India’s multiple identities of religion, region, caste, language, ethnicity, political affiliation and idea of nationhood make for easy division of solidarity for advance of society into sectarian strife that sets democracy back, and reinforces the status quo of unequal power and inequality of opportunity.
To navigate the resultant fractures in society, democracy provides the only reliable guide. Ending triple talaq: is it an attack on minority rights, or a call for greater equality for Muslim women? Apply the touchstone of democracy, which is the bedrock of minority rights.
Giving men the right to divorce their wives just by pronouncing talaq thrice is wholly unequal and undemocratic. All democratic forces must support its scrapping.
Views that run against the grain of popular consensus, whether on the venerability of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Kashmiri alienation or the glory of ancient India, have led to attacks on their holders, physical and online. Should such view be proscribed, because they give offence and could lead to disturbance of public order? Restricting freedom of speech on the ground of possible threat to public order is a slippery slope. If the threat of violence is enough to impose censorship, someone will always spring up to produce that threat. It is the job of the State to protect freedom of speech by tackling threats to law and order.
Where to draw the line is a matter of judgement. But any facile surrender by the administration before threats of violence must be understood as collusion in censorship, and denounced as such.
It is in this context the defence of free expression by the Supreme Court has been most welcome. The judiciary can, and should, hold up the norms of democracy, but it cannot, unless we, the people, stand up for them even more vigorously.

In more normal times the occasion would have dominated the national news and attracted international attention. The agitation for a Ram temple at the “disputed site” in Ayodhya had, after all, preoccupied India since 1990. The movement changed the contours of politics, heralded the rise of the BJP and the corresponding decline of the Congress, and brought the ‘political Hindu’ to the centre stage of public life. For future historians, the Ayodhya movement will be a defining landmark of post-Nehruvian India.
For the ruling BJP in particular, the beginning of temple construction would have been a grand backdrop to the commemoration of the first year of Modi 2.0. Although facilitated by a unanimous Supreme Court judgment, there is little doubt that a peaceful resolution of what once appeared an intractable problem — something that many agonised intellectuals had warned would tear India apart — was possible by the Narendra Modi government’s quiet show of political will. A government less sympathetic to the cause and its underlying impulse would definitely have found ways of ensuring the court decision was kept in indefinite abeyance.
The issue is significant in view of the other defining features of the Modi government in the 10 months since it secured re-election in May 2019. It is often said that any government in India must rule purposefully in its first 18 months because the rest of its five-year term will invariably be devoted to political firefighting. Although this wasn’t the case with Modi 1.0 which pushed demonetisation, GST and the surgical strike against Pakistan in mid-term and thereafter, there is no doubt that the honeymoon period is ideal to proceed with measures that might otherwise be mired in controversy. Rajiv Gandhi, for example, successfully pushed through with the Punjab, Assam and Mizo peace accords, not to mention the anti-defection legislation, in the first 18 months after his massive election victory in 1984. His subsequent record was a tale of missed opportunities, missteps and damaging controversies.
The first 10 months of Modi 2.0 will be remembered for three momentous decisions that were at the heart of the BJP’s alternative vision of India. They were undeniably controversial and were also sledgehammer blows against an older consensus. However, after two consecutive and emphatic election victories, Modi could definitely claim that promises in the election manifesto of the BJP deserved to be viewed as more than items of decoration.
First, there was the abrogation of Article 370 and the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir — an overdue move that was acclaimed everywhere except in three of the 543 constituencies of India. Secondly, the Act to outlaw the iniquitous custom of Triple Talaq conferred a measure of gender justice on Muslim women. More significantly, it established the principle that personal laws of all communities, without exception, had to be periodically modified keeping in mind contemporary notions of right and wrong. Finally, the much more contested Citizenship (Amendment) Act tied up the remaining loose strands of Partition, particularly in eastern India. Although mistakenly decried as being wilfully exclusionary, it was a decisive step in acknowledging stranded Indians as equal citizens.
In his landmark midnight speech to the Constituent Assembly in August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru had stressed the symbolism of giving expression to “the soul of a nation, long suppressed”. It is doubtful if any other government in living memory has done so much in such a short time to bolster the sense of composite nationhood. Combined with the focussed use of technology to inject order into the country’s ever-growing welfare programmes, the Modi government sought to blend rising living standards with assertive nationalism. Predictably, this mission came into conflict with forces that had a looser and somewhat confederal notion of India’s future.
It is impossible at this stage to predict the future course of Modi 2.0 in the aftermath of Covid-19. What is apparent is that the rising graph of economic prosperity that Indians have taken for granted in the past 30 years will plateau in the short term. What isn’t clear so far are the contours of adjustment to the new realities. My understanding is that the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat set out by Modi will be broadly an extension of the approach set out in the first 10 months of the second term. The advent of Covid will witness improvisation, shifts of gear, but no change in the direction of travel.

She in effect means a purge of the party. But what does a purge mean? This is how Stalin effected his purges. He had spies and informants everywhere. You could not even talk to your own spouse in confidence without the feeling of getting betrayed.
 
Now Priyanka has no means to find out who worked or not except through a similar network of spies and informants. Congress people must be sharpening their knives to settle scores. Oh, what ill tidings have come the way of this, once grand party.
 
Priyanka ignores the hulk, sorry, the elephant in the room. Her very own damadG. Before every major election, he starts making noises about entering politics and helping the hoi polloi. But the hoi polloi want to have nothing to do with him. The Gandhi family though wants to have everything to do with him, painting him as a martyr in from of people who refuse to consider him as one.
 
Senior Owaisi dislikes the Congress. But he’s always quick to point out the uncomfortable truth, that Rahul won from Wayanad because of the constituency’s dominant Muslim population. So does Rahul owe you one, Senior Owaisi? More seriously, it really brings to the fore the Congress’s Hindu stance.
 
For decades, the Congress has been bashing Hindus. Ghar Wapsi is ok for Muslims, but not for Hindus. Romila Thapar says, aghast, oh what caste will the Muslim reconvert to. Well, Hindus have decided that the Muslim convert can pick the caste of his or her choice.
 
Love Jihad is ok for Muslims but not for Hindus. Muslims openly practice beti bachao bahu lao, but if a Hindu dare even utter the words, then he’s a rioter. Triple Talaq is a gift for Muslim women but not for Hindus. Islamic terror must be conflated with Hindu terror. Bin Laden and Masood Azhar must have ji as their appellation.
 
Guess what? If the moderate Hindu ran to Modi’s side in 2014 because of the G scandals, he has stayed there in 2019 because of being constantly bashed by the Congress. Or should I say thrashed?


 
Muslims can write in international publications that Modi is out to get them, but the moderate Hindu sees these write-ups as a personal affront. The moderate Hindu is out to get nobody. She has lived in peace with her neighbours, of whichever stripe, for centuries. Instead of being praised then, she is being bashed internationally! Such writers may get published in India-scorning media, but they will never earn acceptance in India.


 
Out of more than 500 parliamentary constituencies, the Congress could only find one — a Muslim majority one in Wayanad — for its chief. The other one of course was Amethi and we know what happened there. Now Aslam Sher Khan wants to be party president. What is he thinking? Does he want to complete the Congress’s Muslim makeover?
 
Sonia Gandhi may have won from Rae Bareli, but that was an isolated, even pyrrhic, victory. All Congress party decisions are made at Sonia Gandhi’s dinner table. But she lost her political nous way back in 2004. 2009 was Manmohan Singh’s victory, and then she made an utter mess of UPA2.
 
2014 should have sent her into political exile, but didn’t. Nor has 2019. She has only become ever more emboldened to serve as a bulwark for Rahul. Rahul berates the old guard for dynastic fixation, but they in turn look at him and say, aren’t you are principal dynast.
 
Rahul says that the old guard did not support him in his chowkidar chor hai slogan. That just shows how politically obtuse he is. The Congress scored in the fifties. If the old guard had rallied behind chowkidar chor hai, then it could have been in the twenties. Narendra Modi might have faltered in his first term, but nobody, except Rahul, and a few of his chamchas, believed that he was a chor.


 
Priyanka reportedly says in a Congress Working Committee meeting that Congress key hathyaarey (Congress’s killers) are seated here. Is she going to launch a purge against the old guard too?
 
The princelings are all descendants of the old guard too. Scindia. Pilot. Deora. Take the Maharajah of Gwalior for instance. He seems to find favour with Rahul. Rahul winked at his direction once he gave that awkward hug to the PM in Parliament, a hug that left the PM completely befuddled.
 
Now half of UP was given to Scindia to manage. But Scindia is not even from UP. He’s from MP, where he lost his own seat. If you are going to berate the old guard such as Gehlot and Chidambaram for practicing nepotism, how come you are curry favouring with beneficiaries of nepotism such as Scindia and Pilot.
 
Scindia was up in Harvard or Yale or wherever just before the election results were announced, attending his son’s graduation. But that’s just it with the princelings. They have the name and the money and the heft to send their kids to Ivy Leagues, whereupon the kids will return to India with their noses up in the air and start lording it over everyone else, with a faux sense of noblesse oblige.


 
The PM doesn’t have any kids, so he cannot send them to Harvard or Yale, but how many people in the BJP do you see doing the same? The culture of entitlement seeps through the Congress, from the old guards, to the princelings, to their kids.
 
And once again, Rahul can’t crib. He too made it to Harvard apparently because of papa. It’s another matter altogether that he finished from the nondescript Rollins College in Florida.


 
For weeks altogether, Rahul is acting as the party chief after having turned in his resignation to mama. She refuses to accept it, he refuses to say a final goodbye. The party is in limbo, a state in which it has been for close to a decade. Let the Priyanka purge begin. At least a few people remember Stalin in Russia with some favour.
 
But Priyanka, that is not because of his purges. That is because of his role in the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war. For everyone loves a winner. Just ask Modi.

     First of all this is not the century old Congress. This is Congress (I) or Indira Congress, the party split by Indira Gandhi. So calling it Indian National Congress is a fraud on the Indian people.Second, Do you really expect the Gandhi's to take any responsibility? They should actually take responsibility for poverty in India versus the richness of Damadji, Chidambaran etc.  They should take responsibility for the Sikh massacre and help send Jagdish Tytler and Kamalnath to jail. They should take responsibility for the humiliation of the Prime Minister Of India, Dr Manmohan Singh for 10 years. There are many such issues that lay at the door of the Gandhis, Downfall of Congress is the lowest in order. It was to happen sooner or later as you cannot fool all people all the time....

With such a high sounding name, the legislation could also have gone the whole hog and taken on other evils like nikah halala, polygamy, and even abandonment of wives. Of course, legislating on abandonment would have opened a can of worms. Abandoned wives in the Hindu community and other religious groups would also have demanded parity.
Though Supreme Court outlawed triple talaq, it did not have a deterrent effect. Cases of triple talaq continued to be reported.  So government decided to push for a law and rightly so, but in creating penal offences the effect may be counterproductive. By prescribing imprisonment of up to three years for a husband uttering triple talaq a marital dispute, better dealt with on the civil side, becomes a criminal offence.

The chances of saving the marriage or a separation and divorce on amiable terms are diminished in this scenario. Making it a non-bailable offence can also worsen the situation. The question of who will provide the subsistence allowance if the husband is in jail and unable to work also arises. Further, when a marriage fails this could set a new precedent where government now starts imprisoning all husbands. Government should limit itself in these marital discord to offering mediation facilities, securing an orderly divorce and the best terms for the wife and children.
Another option the government could have considered was to treat triple talaq as domestic violence and implement the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 in such cases. The PWDVA was a progressive legislation under which women who complain of domestic violence can get protection orders, rights to residence and monetary relief including maintenance. The PWDVA would lend itself very well to victims of triple talaq but unfortunately this has been overlooked. If the Bill gets enacted and its contradictions are challenged, perhaps Supreme Court could point the Centre in the direction of this law.

Yesterday, responding to the Supreme Court’s notice on a clutch of petitions on the matter, the Centre spoke clearly and strongly against triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy: “Gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable overarching constitutional values and can brook no compromise.”
There had been concerns that the matter would be muddled by a simultaneous push for a Uniform Civil Code, where the BJP led government would be suspected of baiting Muslims rather than championing women. But the Centre stayed focused on women’s constitutional rights to equality.
As the TOI edit page has often emphasized, triple talaq has been banned in many countries like Pakistan where Islam is the state religion, plus polygamy is prohibited in many Muslim-majority countries like Turkey. It really is mind-boggling then that that these terribly sexist laws continue to trump women’s constitutional right to equality in our secular country, despite the fact that even their religious credibility is widely contested. How can India move forward trapped in a patriarchal time warp?

Given the unequivocal stand of the Narendra Modi government in its submissions to the apex court, it is very likely that the Supreme Court will outlaw triple talaq. However, this will not bring BJP any closer to its manifesto promise of introducing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC).
Most people rooting for enactment of UCC are under the mistaken impression that only Muslims and Christians follow their customary or religiously ordained laws. There are countless examples to establish that customary practices have not vanished among Hindus, despite countless reforms introduced since the 1950s codification of laws.
Hindus by and large continue following customary practices prevalent among their respective castes, sects and communities even though laws enacted by the state for the Hindu community have been totally secularised. For instance, most Hindu groups avoid intra-gotra marriage because they consider people belonging to the same gotra as sharing a brother-sister bond. Therefore, sagotra marriage is treated as bad as incest even though there is no bar on sagotra marriages in the Hindu Marriage Act.
It defies comprehension why the supposedly progressive Nehru government chose to institutionalise the practice of India’s secular courts doling out justice as per religious laws of different communities, even though Article 44 of the Directive Principles of state policy in the Indian Constitution clearly mandates that “the state shall endeavour to secure for all citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India.”
It is equally puzzling that those who defend the divine sanctity of Muslim Personal Law have willingly submitted to adjudication by India’s secular courts where non-Muslim judges unfamiliar with the intricacies of Islamic law and zero knowledge of Arabic decide matters ostensibly based on Sharia and Quran. It’s as good as having IAS officers manage the affairs of mosques and deliver Friday sermons or lead Eid prayers.
Today even raising this issue threatens to tear asunder the Indian polity because all self-styled secular parties have tarred this constitutional promise as part of BJP’s Hindutva project. Hence the virulent stalemate over UCC. But the solution to this contentious problem is actually quite simple.
I present below a proposal i had offered in 1985 soon after the furore that broke out with the Supreme Court judgment in Shah Bano case. It has the potential to break the stalemate on UCC without either coercing Muslims and Christians into reform or compromising the constitutional promise of equal citizenship rights to all. Its points can be summarised as follows:
India’s secular courts should stop adjudicating disputes on the basis of personal laws of any community – be it Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Parsi.
Instead, the state should confine itself to adjudicating cases only under the existing secular laws such as the Indian Marriage Act, Indian Divorce Act, Indian Succession Act, Indian Wards & Guardianship Act. These should be applicable to all citizens that choose to approach secular courts, irrespective of caste, creed, gender or religion. But these laws need to be carefully reviewed and improved in order to make them egalitarian and gender just.
Those who wish to continue with religio-customary practices of their community should be free to do so provided they don’t expect India’s secular law courts to be saddled with the burden of adjudication and enforcement. Let the onus of ensuring compliance with customary laws rest with consensually accepted authority figures of that community – be it the local imam or granthi, the family priest, caste panchayat or the spiritual gurus of the concerned sects.
However, if even one party to the family dispute feels dissatisfied with the verdict of the authority adjudicating customary law, he/she should have the right to approach the secular courts where the dispute should be adjudicated only within the framework of secular laws applicable to all.
Those who think this amounts to giving a free hand to retrogressive elements among Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis would do well to remember that family laws enacted by the state, including provisions of the Indian Penal Code, come into play only when someone invokes their protection through the police and law courts.
For example, the current law against bigamous marriages among Hindus works in favour of only those Hindu women who choose to sue their husbands in a court of law. A Muslim woman who accepts the second or third marriage of her husband or doesn’t legally lodge a complaint after being arbitrarily abandoned is not going to benefit even if the arbitrary triple talaq is declared illegal. This is true not just for India but also for countries that give no legal recognition to Muslim or Hindu Personal Law as India does.
There is now concrete evidence that when better options are available neither Muslim nor any other group of women hesitate from availing of them. Today a growing number of Muslim women are filing cases under Dowry Prohibition Act as well as the laws against domestic violence, even though these laws don’t draw legitimacy from the Holy Quran or the Shariat.
Neither the All India Muslim Personal Law Board nor any mullah or maulvi has dared openly prohibit Muslim women from doing so. This is because these laws don’t have the word “Hindu” attached to them.
Though these community neutral laws have several flaws, they have had the salutary effect of bringing Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, tribal and non-tribal women on a common platform to fight for what are common problems for women of all communities. Therefore, if we are serious about a UCC, let us do away with laws with a communal tag and let the two systems compete with each other on the basis of voluntary compliance.

Who’s afraid of the big bad gays, the so-called ‘minuscule fraction’? The government has decided that when it comes to the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) population, discretion might be the better part of valour.
When the hearings on the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) started in the Supreme Court, the government asked for a delay. They wanted more time to file a response to a law that dates back to 1861.
The court refused. Then Attorney General K K Venugopal chose not to lead the government response saying, “I had appeared for the curative. I’m told the government’s stand is different, therefore I’m not appearing in that case at all.”
Now the government appears to have no stand at all. In an affidavit filed on behalf of the government, an undersecretary in the ministry of home affairs says the Union of India would leave the question of the constitutional validity of Section 377 to the extent it applies to “consensual acts of adults in private” to the “wisdom of this Hon’-ble Court”.
After the Supreme Court ruled against instant triple talaq, the government painted itself as the knight in shining armour for Muslim women. BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said it was the “political will” of the NDA government that had led to the judgment. The government is betraying no such itch to be seen as the deliverer of acche din to India’s LGBT population. But who knows? If the Supreme Court does strike down Section 377, perhaps they will push to take credit for yet another thing that happened under Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘after 70 years of Congress inaction’.
The problem for GoI is the issue has gone well beyond the ‘minuscule’ LGBT minority. It has become a litmus test of India’s own image of itself, of the kind of liberal democracy it wants to be perceived as. Chest-thumping champions of the government are prone to say ‘Go to Pakistan!’ to anyone who disagrees with them on anything. But they can’t use that time-tested line when it comes to Section 377, since defending that law puts them in company they do not wish to keep: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran.
Not the One to Judge
But being too proactive about striking it down might not go down well with their conservative base, and many in their own ranks like BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, who wears his homophobia on his Twitter sleeve.
Caught in that Catch-22, GoI has decided the safest course is to hide behind the robes of Supreme Court judges and leave Section 377 to them.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-106018"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/000.jpg"" alt="""" width=""460"" height=""479"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/000.jpg 460w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/000-288x300.jpg 288w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/000-50x52.jpg 50w"" sizes=""(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"">
From an activist point of view, a government that gets out of the way of progress is preferable to a government that tries to scuttle it. But it means all the talk about principle is just hogwash. GoI can’t take a principled stand for or against it. Its only damage control has been to request the court to not rule on anything beyond the question of constitutionality of Section 377 itself.
It is terrified that once this closet is cracked open, all kinds of other issues will come tumbling out: marriage, employment discrimination, adoption, etc. It’s almost funny that in its desperation to draw some kind of Lakshman rekha around the issue, the government is basically telling the court: please talk about sex, and nothing but sex. In 1994, then-superintendent of Tihar Jail, Kiran Bedi, refused to allow condoms to be distributed to prisoners.
Her logic was that that was tantamount to condoning homosexual sex, which was a criminal offence under the law. She told activists to change the law and then distribute the condoms. That led to the first challenge to Section 377 in court.
But in most cases, Section 377 is not the issue. Homophobia, or transphobia, is. If Section 377 is struck down and someone walks into his workplace and announces he is gay, he may still get fired. Getting the government out of the bedroom of consenting adults is only the first step. Whether GoI likes it or not, battles about issues like employment non-discrimination are looming. Homosexual lives are about more than sex. Just like heterosexual lives.
Moral, or Science?
In a more ideal world, Section 377 should have been junked by Parliament itself. We should not have needed to rely on the generosity of courts to affirm the basic dignity of LGBT Indians. But our politicians on all sides have been singularly missing in action. When Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tried more than once to introduce a private member’s Bill on Section 377, he faced empty Congress benches and jeering BJP members. “Several MPs who had promised to vote in favour absent,” tweeted Tharoor at that time.
He faced catcalls and snide remarks about why he needed the Bill. Individual BJP politicians like Arun Jaitley have been LGBT-supportive. BJP spokesperson Shaina N C has even spoken as a chief guest at an LGBT film festival.
But when a Subramanian Swamy calls homosexuality a “danger to national security”, they maintain a discreet silence. The battle over Section 377 has shown all of us the difference between a broad chest and a broad mind.

Shayara Bano – a sociology postgraduate and a mother of two – appealed that triple talaq be declared unconstitutional when her husband ended their 15-year-old marriage by sending her a letter with the word talaq written on it thrice.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has declared that the country’s top court has no jurisdiction to undertake the exercise as Muslim Personal Law “is inextricably interwoven with the religion of Islam”, being based on the Quran and not on a law enacted by Parliament. This argument has little logic. It needs to be unequivocally stated that the talaq-i-bidat, admitted by the Muslim Personal Law Board to be “sinful” and an “innovation”, finds no sanction in the Quran.
Neither does the Quran sanction this form of divorce in one sitting nor was it legally held permissible by the Prophet. Such a practice violates the fundamental principles of gender justice, gender equity, good conscience and the dignity of women strongly enunciated in Islam.
The Prophet denounced the pre-Islamic, patriarchal notion of the husband’s absolute right to divorce, stating that divorce was the most reprehensible of all things permitted: “God has not created anything on the face of the earth that he loves more than emancipation; and God has created nothing upon the face of the earth more hateful to him than divorce” (AD 13:3). The Quran illustrates this point by expressing approval when the Prophet recommended that Zayd should not divorce his wife in spite of the fact that there was long standing dissension between husband and wife. “Behold thou should say to one who has received the Grace of God and His favour, retain your wife in wedlock and fear God” (Q 33:37).
The arbitrary, undisputed, absolute power of divorce by the husband with triple talaq in a single sitting was the common customary law practised in pre-Islamic Arabia in the days of jahiliyya or ignorance, where a husband would discard his wife by contemptuously tossing his slipper saying “you are unto me like my slipper”. This is a grave distortion of the law of divorce in Islam and was condemned by the Prophet as the following Tradition demonstrates: “The Messenger of Allah was informed of a man (Rukhana) who divorced his wife three times together, his face became red and he stood up in displeasure and said: ‘Is the Book of Allah being sported with while I am still in your midst?’” (NS 27:6)
This mode of talaq, once pronounced, is considered “bain” or irrevocable where rights of inheritance cease immediately on pronouncement though the death of the husband or wife may occur during the period of iddat or period of waiting. Further, in this form of talaq, if the parties wish to remarry the wife undergoes halala, a humiliating pre-Islamic practice where the wife went through a marriage with another man which is consummated and subsequently dissolved.
As Justice Ameer Ali points out, legitimacy of the triple talaq seems to have crept into Islamic jurisprudence at the instance of the Umayyad monarchs. Inexplicably, although disapproved by the classical jurists, it has been accepted by most Sunni jurists.
Unfortunately the legality of this mode of divorce is upheld in India if the husband were to repudiate his wife during her menstrual flow, if he is in a drunken state, in a fit of temper, in jest, at the slip of a tongue, when the woman is pregnant and other such situations, communicated even by means of a telephone call, an SMS, through Facebook or over Skype.
Needless to say talaq-i-bidat has devastated the lives of many women and children. Deprived of any opportunity for reconciliation, this mode of divorce has been subject to criticism in several Muslim countries.
Modernist interpretation advocated by scholars introduced reform through the juristic means of ijtehad (creative interpretation). Several Muslim countries have brought about reform through codification. Countries like Turkey, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan have either reformed the law completely or brought about legally stringent preventive measures in this area. Tunisia brought about reform by de-recognition of the triple talaq within the circumference and perimeter of Islamic law.
The time has come for major strides to be taken to bring about reform and change in the Muslim Personal Law in India. In order to accomplish this, codification of the Muslim Personal Law is an imperative. The process of codification of Muslim Law must now be seriously undertaken by a group of legal experts, experienced jurists well versed in the Muslim law, legal experts, liberal ulema and scholars in the field. Gender-just laws must be the common denominator. Alongside Muslim women, Muslim men’s organisations must push for change.
If Muslim countries can bring about reform in family laws India must follow suit. In the words of Justice Hidayatullah: “If the lead is coming from Muslim countries, it is hoped that in the course of time the same measures will be applied in India also.”
We await the judgment of the Supreme Court, seeking gender justice.

     constitution is just another book. the  indian constitution is a flawed one. what is supposed to temporary has become permanent. it has only increased communalism, casteism (in the name of reservation) and the whole country is rapid becoming backward. muslim personal is commitment india made to the muslims who stayed back. so no one cannot change that law. further, law is not a substitute for many issues which are best dealt with at a personal or religious level. i believe the muslims are right in fighting to retain their way of life. after not all want to embrace the western way of life and thinking. muslim personal law has evolved over millenium, how can a constitution which has been amended about a 100 times in less than 70 years be superior to the personal law. in any case why is everyone interfering in their personal affairs....

"1616953286-117","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/9/?s=triple+talaq","Assents, Dissents, Consents","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Masquerader/assents-dissents-consents/","Assents, Dissents, Consents","September 30, 2018, 7:35 PM  IST","Anoop Kohli","Though the law primarily, often exclusively, exerts itself in dispensing and asserting justice, there are intermittent occasions when Their Lordships sit down in an exercise to correct their own Law books.
Since such matters are of essence in updating adjudication, a clear verdict is expected, Benches therefore are wide, and as a rule odd numbered, which could be 3, 5 or 7, the highest having gone to 13, in the famous Keshavanand Bharti vs State of Kerala, won by a 7-6 margin, and is often heralded as a landmark for saving Indian Democracy, by what was later purported to as “Basic Structure Doctrine”
Dissents, have a place, and when substantially worded, may become acceptable as a part of amendments, or acceptable provisions under the law. Dissents, therefore matter in Constitutional matters, and as per section 145(3), it is mandated that, “the judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case pertaining to a substantial question of law or the interpretation of the Constitution, shall be 5”
We saw a series of judgments being passed in the last few weeks. From decriminalization of gay relationships, adultery, “triple talaq”, and finally the softening of the Aadhar compulsions. Dangers entertained in the Aadhar, Aadhar-PAN linkage, lay in it being passed as a “Money Bill” by the Parliament. A certain section rousrd fears of India adopting the semblance of a “surveillance state”. For the sake of reviving confidence in effective judicial dissent, a young brilliant Justice Chandrachud (with a lineage, much as CJI Hon’ble Deepak Misra) put a dissenting note. The overall order came out well, though the bench did not clarify, why linking Aadhar to PAN for income tax purposes (section 139AA Income tax Act), is in anyway disparate than linking to bank accounts.
The modified verdict, justified non intrusion of “surveillance”, on the following grounds: i) Existance of a law. Ii)Legitimate State interest iii) Such law should pass the test of proportionality.
I believe, with the economic changes coming, the government may have to retain its act on economic surveillance. We may have Aadhar II soon, that may allay “surveillance” fears, and yet make economic transactions transparent, for issues of national safety (much can be done with a mobile phone today) and finally micro schemes for consumer benefit.
Appreciating as a citizen, the recent dissent, and seeing a judge likely to exceed his father soon is good news for the Indian judiciary!
There have been some landmark dissents which have later influenced law-making. The Keshavanand vs State of Kerala, was memorable in the amount of legal material by the iconic jurist and advocate Nani Palkhiwala assisted by Fali Nariman. Mr Palkhiwala’s un-eatable argument was that though the parliament has the powers to amend the Constitution, it cannot toy with the “basic structure” like fundamental rights, matters close to the Preamble and Directive Principles. This later came out to take the shape of a much quoted legal principle, “Basic Structure Doctrine,” that has been quoted and strengthened arguments in various cases.
In terms of legal grit and integrity, the lone dissent of Justice HR Khanna stands out on an international basis too.
The case of Habeas Corpus during Emergency, in Dec 1975, was between Shiv Kant Shukla vs Addl DM of Jabalpur, challenging the provisions of MISA. A five judge bench comprising Justices, AN Ray, PN Bhagwati, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg, and HR Khanna. The MISA and confinement was upheld, but what a blistering comment by justice Khanna:
“The Constitution and Law of India do not permit life and liberty to be at the absolute power of the Executive. What is at stake is the Rule of Law. The question is whether the law speaking authority of the court shall be absolutely silenced and rendered mute—-detention without trial is an anathema to all those who love liberty”
It has often been commented, particularly in comparison to management of Constitutional matters, that the Indian system has much pending. And bench strength required by various legal parameters, lacks in giving sufficient intellectual input that such issues beg. There are conflicting judgements, often termed as “polyvocal” system in Constitutional matters. As compared to a single voice on Constitutional matters in in the US Supreme Courts.
For instance, the Aadhar case had earlier been taken up, it was earlier taken up as the Puttuswamy judgement, where Hon’ble Justices Ashok Bhushan, and Justice Sikri mandated the Aadhar-Pan link, but let the issue uncovered with regards to infringement of privacy necessitating thereby the present 5 judge bench.
It has been suggested, that there should be a separate court within the Apex Court, that may deal with Constitutional matters, because the matters require deep intellectual exercises, and at least a seven- bench strength for each hearing. Further suggestions deal with four Cassation Benches, each dedicated for one of the four zones.
Economic growth as well as diversity, land acquisition for development, and existing rules, river water disputes, trademark and investment principles are only going to mount.
Some retiring talent may be retained in setting up a separate full strength of an exclusive Constitutional court, with adequate strength.
Law and a civil society, and the impulses of politics, shall continue to be at loggerheads for power.
The essence is that the system of checks and balances should always be on its toes!

The sight of the saffron-clad Peethadeeshwar of Baba Gorakshnath Peeth in the top seat in Lucknow has turned their incredulous disbelief at BJP’s massive UP mandate into snorts of self-righteous derision.
The intellectual response to the Yogi has ranged from dire predictions of a looming end of the republic, to renewed calls for a hallowed battle in defence of secularism versus Hindutva, to Rajmohan Gandhi’s evocative invocation of Tulsidas and his portrayal of a ‘virath’ Raghubeera (chariot-less Ram) girding up in the Ramayana’s final battle against a ‘rathi’ (charioted) Ravan.
Talking chiefly to the converted, these angry responses – calling for a renewed defence of what liberals see as a huge breach in the great wall of Indian secularism – may make them feel better about their notions of resistance. But, politically speaking, they miss the plot entirely.
First, highfalutin talk of ideological battles is always intoxicating and comforting to one’s own self-image. But election after election has shown that a large section of Indian voters are not ideological any more. They, and especially the younger ones who make up the bulk of our electorate, vote for what suits them best materially in a given local context.
BJP’s Hindutva credentials have never been in doubt. With its audacious gamble on Adityanath, who was among its most popular state leaders in pre-poll internal surveys, the party has done nothing more than pin its own colours to the mast, making a clear play for a Hindu consolidation leading up to 2019. Critics saying with horror that the saffron party is Hindu don’t tell voters anything they didn’t know already.
With Yogi as its political UP mascot, BJP’s political signalling couldn’t be clearer. Hindutva is not something we use only instrumentally to get votes, the party seems to be saying, and then junk after winning elections. It is intrinsic to its development focus too, with a notion of progress that is intertwined with notions of Hindu-ness. The two are inseparable, not separate compartments to pick and choose from.
No appeasement, no apologies, no double meaning: this is the political message. The collapse of UP’s caste praxis and the Mandal vote has led to a hard calculation that the party has very little to lose from such a gambit.
It is betting that those who don’t like it ideologically will never vote BJP anyway and the rest of the voting public won’t care as long as developmental gains keep coming, and as long as Hindutva aims are pursued within the bounds of constitutionality.
Second, the secular versus Hindutva fault line has lost its power as a rallying cry because of the sheer hypocrisy of the secular side of the argument. Mayawati’s unambiguous pursuit of the mullah constituency, politically discredited clerical voices like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid and criminal types was a case in point.
From the notorious Shah Bano case in the 1980s to the promotion of stereotyped meat-trader-musclemen candidates in 2017, nothing has been more damaging to the cause of secularism than repeated cynical manipulations of the Muslim vote by avowedly secular leaders themselves. From Azam Khan to clerics whose only aim is to protect a more obscurantist view of the shariah than practised in many Muslim countries – witness the debate on triple talaq – secularism has long been an empty slogan.
Its degeneration from its lofty origins as a principle to defend cultural plurality, to a fig leaf that ended up protecting the backward-looking Muslim religious right, damaged its legitimacy. Little wonder then that invocations to secularism, like critiques of demonetisation before it, may excite well-heeled drawing rooms in Delhi but elicit little enthusiasm where it matters: on the political streets.
Third, a saffron-clad monk holding political office is not new by itself. Uma Bharti preceded Yogi Adityanath. In the end, he will be judged by what he does in office.
From leading the love jihad campaign to asking those who didn’t do the surya namaskar to leave India, the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini has long been seen as embodying the fringe. But his parliamentary record is interesting.
The five-time Lok Sabha MP has participated in 55 debates since mid-2014 and asked 284 questions. The documented record shows only eight of these debates (14.5%) and two questions (0.7%) were related to Hindutva-related causes. The majority pertained to other issues, on topics ranging from inclusion of Bhojpuri in the Constitution’s Eighth Schedule to encephalitis.
This indicates that the firebrand political monk is more than a one-trick pony. The real question is, which side of his will be dominant in running UP?
From chasing illegal slaughter-houses to setting up Romeo squads, Adityanath has done nothing so far that BJP did not promise in its manifesto. His publicly stated course-correction after the negative feedback on harassment of couples by Romeo squads shows tactical awareness and most of his first detailed speech since taking office focussed on BJP’s developmental objectives, including Rs 6,000 crore of farm loan-waivers.
As long as he can keep polarisation from spiralling into violence, like that seen at a meat shop in Hathras, demonising the Yogi plays into the old anti-Modi model. The more you criticise, the more it strengthens his vote base.
Liberals need a new narrative and a fundamental rethink, that goes beyond the old secular rhetoric.

     secularism is failed ideology. it only produced dictators or dynasties. it is creation of british imperialists to perpetuate the house of tudors who by the way are head of anglican church without reading the bible. the british king not only murdered the bishops but ordained himself as the head of church. united states which broke away from british imperialism   wanted nothing to do with secularism which  always treated other religions like catholics and jews with most crippling discriminations. americans on the other hand adopted pluralism with equal rights to all religions embedded in the constitution. unfortunately the greate historian that is jawaharlal nehru had never heard about pluralism. when vinayak damodar savarkar first wrote about hindutva british were shaken to the core. it smelled exactly like pluralism plus power to unite all casts and plus possibility of  harmonizing with other religions like united states. no wonder hindutva proponents subjected to kala pani and mild flexible congress leaders were incarcerated in india&#039;s best palaces. while our english language journalist and jnu bred leftists thinkers hate hindutva for same reason as british hated it, there is no evidence that philosophy of hindutva is as decadent as seculrism which is only flourishing in england....

With the government and the Opposition both playing vote bank politics, this important legislation is stuck in a logjam.
The practice of triple talaq blatantly discriminates against Muslim women.  But the NDA government’s decision to criminalise the practice has provoked the Opposition’s accusation that the bill seeks to penalise Muslim men, and is communal in nature.
With an eye to the 2019 general elections, both sides are on a vote-catching exercise.  The government’s agenda in this is not the welfare of Muslim women but a bid to gain the approval of those who want a common civil code, and will see the proscription of triple talaq as the first step to this goal.
By challenging the criminalising of triple talaq on the grounds that imprisoning offenders could leave families without a breadwinner, the Opposition seeks to project itself as a champion of minorities, overlooking the inconvenient fact that Muslim women constitute a vulnerable minority within a minority.
A possible solution to the political deadlock which would promote gender equality would be for a social sanction being given to Muslim women to also have the right to practice triple talaq, with the all-important proviso that the husband so summarily divorced would have to continue to financially support his ex-wife, and their children, if any.
If Muslim women were given a reciprocal right, perhaps the practice of triple talaq would end, or at least be significantly reduced if it stops being a male prerogative and is made gender neutral.
The one-way street of triple talaq should be made into a two-way thoroughfare, with male chauvinist patriarchy meeting its match in an equal and opposite feminist matriarchy.

This week they won a great victory in court. But its euphoria is tempered by ground realities, where reform will take more time and enlightenment – and perhaps pain.
Over in Kolkata for example Ishrat Jahan is battling a social boycott. The SC verdict has opened floodgates of expletives against her: like gandi aurat (dirty woman), enemy of men, un-Islamic. Her lawyer Nazia Ilahi Khan is being trolled online. But even as Ishrat is learning that the court judgment will not change society by itself, she is refusing to get dispirited. She has decided to remove her niqab, to say to other women that she is not a victim anymore and every ordinary woman can fight for her rights like her, to push for change within the community.
Bengal minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury has meanwhile declared the SC verdict unconstitutional, actually urging Muslims not to abide by it. This is beyond irresponsible, pandering to fundamentalism and oppression of women as it does. Interestingly, even as SC has set aside talaq-e-biddat, there is no gender equality in talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan either. Women will demand greater agency over time. Such demands will grow across religions, and successfully. Defending the sexist status quo or suppressing women’s voices is a medieval game.

     How can Bengal minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury urge Muslims not to abide SC verdict. Is he above SC? Is he above law? Can&#039;t he be punished on defamation charges?

All polls point to a BJP landslide in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh despite the extensive campaigning by Rahul Gandhi in the former. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have won but his stature will come down a few rungs because of his unacceptable conduct during the elections – casting aspersions on former PM Manmohan Singh’s loyalties.
The Opposition will predictably use the session to grill the government on the GDP fall during the October to December quarter when demonetization was announced and the teething troubles faced during GST rollout. More issues have now fallen into lap courtesy the Chinese setting up camp in Doklam, allegedly diverting the Yarlung Tsangpo, which becomes Brahmaputra in India, and The Print story on NDA HRD ministers Smriti Irani and Prakash Javadekar allegedly exceeding the discretionary quota — for nominating students to Kendriya Vidyalayas — many times over. Meanwhile, there is also The Wire story on Amit Shah’s son’s company doing phenomenal business before shutting down.
The Opposition has, for the first time, a number of issues in its armoury. But its ability to rake them in the Lok Sabha will be limited. The rules of the game have changed in the Rajya Sabha with the election of Venkaiah Naidu as vice-president, and therefore Rajya Sabha chairperson. The speed with which Naidu decided Sharad Yadav’s disqualification will not be lost on the Opposition. He is unlikely to take too kindly to disruptions. But if he will not accede to Opposition demands for discussions the situation could turn volatile.
Coming to legislation listed for consideration and passing, the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill has generated some heat over the bail-in clause with worries that depositors may be shortchanged by struggling banks. Though the government has allayed such fears the Opposition is bound to play it up. The JPC report is expected next week. While the outlawing of instant triple talaq will be welcome, the jailing of Muslim men who pronounce triple talaq is bound to generate heat. The Opposition is likely to seek civil remedies and oppose criminalising instant triple talaq.
The amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act making bribe-giving an offence, and the Whistleblower Act specifying restrictions on corruption-related disclosures may turn controversial. More contentious will be the amendment to the Citizenship Act which proposes that illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan from specified religious groups will be eligible to apply for Indian citizenship. The exclusion of Muslims, who are majorities in these countries, is problematic. The opposition contention is that those who are persecuted must be considered irrespective of religion. However, the JPC is expected to submit its report only  in the last week of the winter session.
Rahul Gandhi’s status will be another big talking point in the winter session. Will he take over as leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party from Mallikarjun Kharge.  So far he has been content sitting in the second row with the likes of Jyotiraditya Scindia and KC Venugopal.  As Congress president, he would do well to take charge of the Congress delegation in Parliament too and hone his debating skills, which remain untested. His parliamentary record has been below par and speeches have been rather ordinary. He would do well to use this spell in the Opposition to up his game. His ten years as a ruling party MP hardly helped his cause in Parliament because it is ministers who run the show for the ruling party.
The Winter Session will also help the Opposition regroup. In Rahul Gandhi, it finally has found the leader who can take the non-BJP grouping forward. But the Opposition must support the legislative agenda of the government. Blocking the government will not earn any more brownie points with the people. The Modi government must not worry too much about the points that the Opposition is likely to make in debates. It needs to merely strive to keep control over the narrative and tone down the divisive rhetoric and aggression. The Chinese ring-fence over India is a looming threat and unity and clearheaded strategising is the need of the hour.

"1616953402-144","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/8/?s=triple+talaq","Role of civil society in the making of new India","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/the-rock-bottom/role-of-civil-society-in-the-making-of-new-india/","Role of civil society in the making of new India","June 26, 2019, 6:11 PM  IST","Om Parida","India is a country that has historic past, eventful present and an aspiring future. The futuristic idea of new India is being marketed by the present government with a hope for better living standard, prosperous economy, powerful defence settlement, harmonious society in the years to come. The budget has been allocated, schemes have been launched and advertisements, awareness campaigns have been started to achieve the objective of new India. However, this seems to be inadequate as far as creating a newer version of India is concerned without the active participation of the civil society.
 Civil society is the society driven by people themselves has its origin in ancient times although the understanding and meaning have changed over a period of time. The Roman word societas civilis was the root word of it having a synonymity with a good society. It was Hegel, the German philosopher who has coined the term civil society and the meaning of it that we understand today. In a civil society people voluntarily come together to achieve the desired objective of welfare of the society or to raise the problems of people before the state. Basically, the voids of the state can be rightly filled by civil society.
In this regard, India needs the effective role of civil society in the making of new India. All the new initiatives of the government require the participation and awareness of people and there is no better organisation than the civil society to achieve this objective. Involvement of civil society in the Swachha Bharat Mission has made it a huge success. Role of Swacchagrahis has a visible impact in changing the behaviour of people to stop open defecation practices in rural areas. Similarly, Swachha iconic places and Swachhata Pakwada are the instances of roles of civil society in bringing out transformation the society.
Likewise, the various NGOs working for the conservation of nature and biodiversity which are quite essential for a healthy, clean and biologically sound India. The civil society movements like the Chipko, Apiko movements of the past for the protection of tree to the present day Aravali Bachao and Narmada Bachao Abhiyan try to achieve a similar objective in sync with the idea of new India.
As a society, we need civil societies like anything because it will protect the basic human needs against the tyranny of the state. The rights of the minority, depressed class along with individual rights of freedom, liberty are protected duly by civil society. Further, civil society has a great role in stopping the majoritarian tendencies and protecting the spirit of diversity in India.
On the global arena, peace is being spread by the organisation like Red Cross. Similarly, the Peace International, Observer Research Foundation and SIPRI etc help in promoting disarmament, peace and the new global outlook for future. Hence, the role of civil society in a peaceful world is equally important and peace in the world will add to the prosperity of India.
Anti-corruption movements and the changes in the outlook of people in India regarding this serious issue of corruption have impacts on the political structure of India. Although corruption has not died down completely the awareness due to the civil society movement has affected the corrupt structure greatly.
Be it the movement for freedom of expression or be it for the fight of LGBT community against the decriminalisation under section -377 of IPC or be it the fight of women against instant triple talaq there is present the active contribution and wholehearted support of civil society.
In many instances, the role of civil society becomes a headache for the government and it tries to restrict it. This is altogether detrimental for society. The dream of new India cannot be fulfilled without a vibrant civil society and hence all of us should try to protect the civil societies for a brighter future tomorrow.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image has acquired a new sheen after the surgical strikes across the LoC, which have reinforced the impression of a man who can take tough decisions when necessary. BJP is in an overdrive to capitalise on this, putting up hoardings across UP towns lauding him and the army jawans. Given the current mood that India needed to give a more muscular response to Pak-supported terrorism – Uri was a defining moment – the military strikes have heartened ordinary folk in UP and across the country.
Though BJP will continue to use issues like Kairana and triple talaq to rally Hindus behind it – love jihad and cow vigilantism had anyway intensified the Hindu-Muslim divide in parts of UP – this time, it is trying to widen its catchment area.
There are signs of the party transiting from overt Hindutva themes to flog the wider issue of “nationalism”. Both the PM and Amit Shah had described nationalism as the BJP’s “identity” and “agenda” and the surgical strikes have brought it centre stage again. Many believe that the government may push for yet another strike later this year to demonstrate its resolve, either in response to a retaliatory move by Pakistan or even without it. The critical question, however, is whether advantage Modi will translate into advantage BJP in UP.
For even as there is renewed enthusiasm for Modi personally, there are few signs of a BJP wave. At the end of the day local issues, local caste alignments, and a dynamic chief ministerial face which the BJP does not have nor intends to project, cannot be discounted in a state poll.
What will undoubtedly help BJP is a divided and a multi-polar opposition, particularly if there is a division in the Muslim vote. That is why Mayawati has repeatedly urged Muslims not to “waste” their vote, and an effective Dalit-Muslim combination behind Mayawati is what worries BJP. If this comes about, she will sweep in western UP.
Muslims are keeping their cards very close to their chest. Traditionally they have preferred the Samajwadi Party to BSP. Even in 2007 when Mayawati came to power with a majority on her own, she garnered only 17% of Muslim votes while Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose SP was routed, managed 45% of the Muslim vote.
The BSP chief senses an opportunity today with open war inside the Mulayam family and the consolidation of the Modi-Amit Shah ‘Jodi’ at the top making the minorities more apprehensive. Not only has Mayawati given over 100 tickets to Muslims, she is now pitching BSP’s Muslim face Naseemuddin Siddiqui as the “Qaid” (leader) of the Muslim community, who will safeguard their interests and for whom they should vote en bloc. She has never profiled any of her colleagues in this fashion before.
Through the recent moves Akhilesh Yadav has made – such as the decision to shun SP’s silver jubilee celebrations – the UP chief minister is stepping up pressure on father Mulayam to ensure that he is given his due share in the process of distributing party tickets, now that uncle Shivpal Yadav has been made party chief. After rebuffing him initially by saying that there would be no chief ministerial face for SP, Mulayam had to relent and declare Akhilesh as the party’s CM candidate.
Unlike Shivpal who draws his strength essentially from Mulayam’s politics, Akhilesh has built an independent constituency in UP in the last two to three years, and many are appreciative of the development work he has completed or undertaken.
If push came to shove and Akhilesh continues to be marginalised by father and “Uncle brigade”, could there be a split in SP? How would that affect poll prospects in the country’s largest state and set the tempo for 2019?
When Akhilesh hits the road on November 3 to kick off his poll campaign, he will test the support he enjoys on the ground. He is not only waging a battle to reclaim his powers in the party, wrested from him in a bout with uncle Shivpal, he is also playing for future stakes and attempting to acquire a greater grip over his party.
If the party splits, could he forge a front with others? How UP would respond to such a formation is anybody’s guess. But Akhilesh is in touch with Ajit Singh’s RLD, which attempted to align with BJP but failed because of the saffron party’s insistence on a merger, and with JD(U). He had softened his stance towards Rahul Gandhi, whose “khaat yatra” had created a buzz till his “khoon ki dalali” remarks derailed it.
Akhilesh is a clean and young face, something of a development icon who has had experience running the country’s largest state without acquiring a negative image. The sympathy generated for him recently has also helped deflect from the shortcomings of his regime.
As of now there is every indication of UP 2017 going back to emotive issues – unlike 2007 or 2012 state polls which went beyond caste and community or the 2014 elections, which hit a new high on development rhetoric.

"1616952905-22","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/14/?s=triple+talaq","Let Vande Mataram bridge the differences","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/right-and-wrong/let-vande-mataram-bridge-the/","Let Vande Mataram bridge the differences","November 8, 2009, 3:07 AM  IST","Swapan Dasgupta","Last Tuesday, home minister P Chidambaram drew flak for attending a convention of maulvis in Deoband where, among other things, it was decreed that Muslims should shun Vande Mataram, India’s national song. The attack was both misdirected and misplaced. If anything, the minister deserved admiration for his sermon on democratic niceties to a gathering of theologians professing a wide range of certitudes. ‘‘The golden rule in a democracy,’’ he told the convention hosted by Darul Uloom, arguably the most influential Sunni Muslim seminary in the subcontinent, ‘‘is that it is the duty of the majority to protect the minority, be it religious, racial or linguistic. It is a self-evident rule… firmly rooted in the universality of human rights.’’
What seemed self-evident to Chidambaram, has been self-evident to most Indians for long. Stemming from Hindu sanatan dharma, diversity and negotiations have been at the heart of the Indian experience. From overcrowded railway compartments to modes of worship and even politics, ‘adjustment’ has been the euphemism for a nebulous humaneness that is at odds with intolerance, regimentation and the quest for super-efficiency. ‘‘We are like this only’’ may be a caricature of India’s blundering and chaotic ways but it is also a profound encapsulation of a civilizational resilience that has astounded outsiders. ‘‘The secret of (India’s) permanence lies,’’ wrote a puzzled Edmund Candler, an Englishman, in 1910, ‘‘I think, in her passivity and power to assimilate. The faith that will not fight cannot yield.’’
Since 1945, freedom in the West has been reduced to the right to offend and the freedom to pursue alternative lifestyles. Compared to the exhibitionism of same-sex marriages and the robust show of artistic freedom (including blasphemy and pornography), India’s commitment to democratic freedom may seem less marked. The right to offend is qualified — witness the mounting pile of banned books and the harassment of M F Husain — and there is a tendency to skirt thorny issues such as the Common Civil Code on the grounds that Muslim sensibilities could be hurt.
The spirit of ‘adjustment’ has meant looking the other way when convenient. The triple talaq may appear to violate the ‘‘universality of human rights’’ that Chidambaram referred to in Deoband. But to many Hindus, there is nothing universal about the gender bias in Muslim personal laws; it is a Muslim problem. Except on the touchy issue of cow slaughter, where Hindus are disinclined to look the other way, minority rights in India have been nourished by Hindu self-sufficiency, verging on indifference. Despite attempts by activists and reformers to motivate Hindus into looking beyond personal salvation and the well-being of their family, the ‘live and let live’ principle has sustained Indian democracy and prevented civil strife.
The Hindu ability to be blissfully self-centred has also rested on the absence of provocation. Chidambaram was right to lay the defence of the minority on the doors of the majority but he should have touched on a corresponding concern: Do minorities have obligations too?
Muslim objections to the imagery of Vande Mataram have been around for the past 100 years when the song first captured the nationalist imagination. This was perhaps the main reason why the Constituent Assembly chose Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Jana gana mana’ as the national anthem and relegated Vande Mataram to the status of a ‘national song’. Since then, it has repeatedly been clarified that it is not obligatory for all Indians to sing Vande Mataram. Yet, while the singing of the first verse of Bankim Chandra’s evocative anthem was deemed to be voluntary, it was understood there would be no disrespect shown to it either. Vande Mataram, after all, became the signature tune of the nationalist movement, not as a calculated disrespect to Muslim feelings; its imagery was located in a different tradition.
At the root of the problem is the spirit of accommodation. By putting its stamp on a fatwa, a religious decree against singing Vande Mataram, the Darul Uloom has violated the mutual show of generosity that is so essential for democracy. It is one thing to deem that singing Vande Mataram is voluntary; it is a separate matter to forbid Muslims from singing the national song. The first is an exercise of choice; the second is an example of doctrinaire intolerance, an act of provocation that will inevitably encourage hotheads to make Vande Mataram a loyalty test of Indian-ness. In 1997, A R Rahman bridged the Vande Mataram divide with his own tribute to Mother India; last week the Deobandis reopened an old wound.
It’s time the worthies in Deoband realised that minority rights can’t be nourished unless accompanied by an equal show of minority wisdom.

The BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are bitter rivals. But when it comes to the two crucial upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, both are going into elections without a chief ministerial face. The similarity does not end there. A majority of opinion polls have also put the two parties in the lead: the BJP in UP and the AAP in Punjab.
They also face the challenge of overthrowing the two established parties in either state that have ruled there for long: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress in Punjab, and the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in UP. For the BJP, the UP battle is all-crucial in its pitch for a second term for the Narendra Modi government in 2019. A loss here after Bihar will dent its chances.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-77891 size-full"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Modi-keju.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Modi-keju.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Modi-keju-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">Every thought of moving to Punjab, Arvindji?
For the AAP, Punjab is a do-or-die gateway to becoming a party with national relevance ahead of 2019. The party’s expansionist plans may come crashing down if it loses in Punjab. Both parties are also running the biggest campaigns in the states compared to others.
Given the stakes and other competitors having chief ministerial candidates, it is surprising that both parties do not wish to go into the poll battle with a clear CM face and inform the electorate beforehand about the alternative people should vote for. In fact, both parties have put forward four names each alluding to them being in the race for the chief minister’s chair.
BJP Parivartan Yatras kicked off in Uttar Pradesh with Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Uma Bharti and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya participating. Arvind Kejriwal refused to accept an offer from the Congress’ Amarinder Singh for a debate on Punjab.
Functionaries of both the parties cite similar reasons for not declaring a chief ministerial face: the lack of any leader having a cross-regional appeal, fear of division in ranks after one name is declared above others and the resultant damage to the party’s prospects.
The formula at both parties seems to be the same too: let various contenders put their best foot forward to make either party win and a call be taken after polls on the most deserving performer.
Recent developments in both states could, however, dent this strategy. With Mulayam Singh Yadav ruling out possibility of an SP-Congress-RLD-JDU alliance in UP and putting his bets on the popular CM face in Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP could look rudderless.
Similarly, the possibility of a strong campaigner in Navjot Singh Sidhu joining the Congress in Punjab plus an official announcement of Amarinder Singh as the chief ministerial face — after he resigned as MP over the emotive Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) issue and could now contest the assembly polls — could put pressure on the AAP to come clear.
There is an X-factor with both parties though that may well be delaying the move to nominate a chief ministerial candidate. Union home minister Rajnath Singh has so far showed no inclination to take up the Uttar Pradesh chief minister candidate mantle, pitching his level to be above that of the other three ‘contenders’ stating that he has already been Uttar Pradesh chief minister once. In case of a Uttar Pradesh win though, Singh may find it difficult to ignore the popular demand from within his party and its top leadership.
Kejriwal, too, has so far not ruled out the possibility of him becoming the Punjab chief minister if the party wins, though the party in the past has insisted that only a Punjabi from its ranks would become chief minister, a claim that rules out Haryana-born Kejriwal jumping ship from Delhi. However, many suspect Kejriwal has such ambitions given the troubles he is facing in Delhi, being a half-state and all powers being concentrated in hands of the lieutenant governor after court rulings.
Kejriwal has not been able to flourish with full powers as Delhi chief minister and may want to prove a point to the government as Punjab chief minister.
The BJP, meanwhile, is sticking to a similar script in Uttar Pradesh as it had in its Bihar campaign: a narrative that starts with development before being spiked with doses of polarisation.
In his speech in Saharanpur last week while kicking off the party’s Parivartan Yatras, BJP president Amit Shah spoke of the BJP “conducting the surgical strikes in Pakistan”, asked why people have to be so sad whenever the BJP talks about triple talaq, and pointed out that while the SP had the ‘Afzals and Ansaris’ and the BSP had the ‘Nisamuddin Siddiquis’, the BJP had no such ‘ruffians’ in its ranks.
During the Bihar campaign, the BJP placed advertisements on cow protection on poll days and Shah spoke of firecrackers going off in Pakistan if the BJP lost — which it eventually did by a massive margin. It also did not declare its chief ministerial face in Bihar. The party is eerily doing the same in UP.

A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.
Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.
At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.
For Muslim Women
To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.
Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.
The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.
The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.
The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.
The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.
Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole
Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.
Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.
When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.
In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.
And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.
The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.
Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all.

This major milestone gives us an opportunity to reflect. On Friday the 11th of August, I read about a letter by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) to the Hon’ble Chief Justice seeking his intervention in expeditiously giving an order in the triple talaq case. The BMMA said “We urge your Lordships to kindly pronounce the judgment at the earliest. Thousands of Muslim women are eager to hear a judgment that would put an end to their ordeal after being divorced arbitrarily and instantly.” The fact is, can India truly be considered a country that treats individuals equally irrespective of their gender, if a man can unilaterally divorce his wife by uttering three words.
During the hearing of the triple talaq case in the Hon’ble Supreme Court, The All India Muslim Personal Law Boards (AIMPBL) lawyer, Mr. Kapil Sibal said that, “the Muslim community is like small birds on which golden eagles prey.” If ever there was a misplaced metaphor this was it. Who was Mr. Sibal calling a golden eagle in this case was he referring to the BMMA or to the majority. Was he talking as a lawyer representing a client or politician securing a vote bank?
The BMMA, the proverbial golden eagle in Mr. Sibal’s words, are brave women unafraid to fighting against triple talaq. They are path breakers who have proposed measures such as abolition of polygamy, practice of halala and muta marriage. They have proposed that there needs to be a minimum age for marriage of men and women and custodial rights for women. Another noteworthy organisation the Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal, founded by Hamid Dalwai in 1970 in Pune has been working for Muslim women rights since 1970s. The Mandal has the rare distinction of working during the Shahbano times and providing support to the cause.
From the upholding of Shah Banos rights where the Hon’ble Supreme Court granted a Muslim woman the right to maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC to the The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 which entirely diluted Muslim women’s rights to maintenance, the movement for gender justice has had a rough road. The landmark Shamim Ara vs State of UP brought some respite where the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed that for talaq to be valid it must be pronounced as per Quarantic procedures. But how many women know about the Shamin Ara case and have the ability to enforce it? The reality still remains that women continue to be divorced via email, letter and even Skype. The AIMPBL seems to have taken the convenient route of expressing concern over triple talaq while taking no steps to stop it. They maintain that triple talaq is reprehensible but valid. When even extreme states like Pakistan can prohibit triple talaq why can India not.
The practice of triple talaq relegates women to a life of fear with no security. Living in a social construct where a husband has the option to utter the words “talaq, talaq, talaq” and a family would be broken is enough to keep a woman feeling anxious, desperate and
The AIMPBL has said that anyone who engages in this practice will be socially boycotted and yet they have a “triple talaq corner” on their website which actively encourages women to sign the petition. What is also deeply concerning, is that those who define themselves as ‘secularist’ and women’s rights activists have come out to support this draconian practice. Hindu tradition has also had draconian acts such as Sati,that has now all been snuffed out of memory. Movements such as widow re-marriage, that have been championed by icons such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. The Muslim community is coming together under organizations to demand rights that are just and fair, we must not let politics get in the way of it. It is time that we do away with this hypocrisy, because supporting this custom will only lead to communities regressing instead of progressing.
I recently watched “Lipstick Under My Burkha” which is a feminist film. The film maker who knew present could not predict the future of those four women. It held a mirror to society and hence a successful piece of art. It showed us the tremendous need for reform and acceptance. A tremendous opportunity for reform has been placed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Every Chief Justice, in fact every member of the judiciary, can leave a legacy.  If today our Chief Justice takes this opportunity to pass the relief the BMMA has asked for, it would make a difference in the lives of lakhs of women all over the nation. After all we must realize its not a fight for Muslim women but all women will feel that we have taken a step forward towards gender equality.

In Islam, there is a prescribed procedure for divorce. First, divorce is considered extremely undesirable. But, if a couple seek to divorce, they have to follow a prescribed course. That is, the husband shall utter the word ‘talaq’ on three separate occasions to his wife over a period of three months. The intervening period between each utterance of ‘talaq’ is meant for reconciliation. If, after the end of the third month, the husband finally utters the word ‘talaq’, then, the two will be divorced.
In the time of the Prophet and the first caliph, Abu Bakr, certain individuals would divorce their wives in one sitting by uttering the word ‘talaq’ three times, usually in a burst of anger. This is why the Prophet and Abu Bakr would regard the uttering of instant triple talaq as only one talaq, and they did not, therefore, finalise the divorce in such cases.
But the practice of pronouncing ‘talaq’ in one instance continued till the time of the second caliph, Umar Faruq, who took another decision – he declared that pronouncing ‘talaq’ in one sitting would be considered final and the couple would be divorced. But, he would flog any man who said ‘talaq’ three times instantly, as deterrence.

Muftis who came after Umar followed the course set by him. They began to deem the pronouncing of ‘talaq’ three times in one sitting as irrevocable. Then, in the 13th century, Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, opined that uttering ‘talaq’ three times on a single occasion should not be taken as final; it must be regarded as the first step in divorce proceedings. Except for the Salafi scholars, the ulema, or Islamic scholars, did not accept Ibn Taymiyyah’s fatwa. Hence muftis continue to issue fatwas according to Umar’s precedent. Thus Umar’s decision on divorce came to be looked upon as ijma, or the consensus of the Muslim community, that cannot be changed.
Only the Salafi group of scholars follows Ibn Taymiyyah’s opinion, while others follow Umar’s precedent. In my view, it is wrong to consider Umar’s decision as ijma. What Umar did was simply in the nature of an executive order given by a caliph, and it should not have been taken as ijma. But scholars of the later period did not accept Ibn Taymiyyah’s opinion, as they thought it was at variance with ijma. But, Ibn Taymiyyah’s opinion actually only ran counter to the executive order of a caliph and was not against ijma.
Since the community considers giving talaq as a matter of the shariah, Islamic scholars ought to consider Umar’s decision as purely the executive order of an individual rather than raise it to the level of ijma. Secondly, to put an end quite conclusively to the practice of triple talaq, the state can take the stand that it will revive and legitimise the Quranic practice of giving talaq over a period of three months and that if anyone goes against this, he will be punished.
In matters of marriage and divorce, which are very sensitive, Muslims listen to the advice of the clergy. Therefore, the government should encourage Islamic scholars to reach an agreement that Ibn Taymiyyah’s opinion was right, while Umar’s decision was actually his ijtihad, a personal opinion, which may be either right or wrong. Ijtihad is always subject to correction. Because so many women are suffering due to instant triple talaq and the Bill now going to Rajya Sabha, Muslims must not protest in favour of this practice.

Temples from Kedarnath to Guruvayur are a part and parcel of political campaigning nowadays. Sabrimala row has weakened the communists and BJP is exploring chances of luring communist voters and cadre in Kerala, like it has succeeded in West Bengal.
Savarkar had envisaged a Hindu rashtra where the Muslims lived like second-class citizens. In consonance with this thinking, his ideological follower is willing to give scholarships to minorities students, a berth in the cabinet to a “trophy” Muslim from Rajya Sabha, higher Haj quota but his Lok Sabha face will be an undertrial charged with carrying out terror attack on muslims. The mask of advising party MPs to win sabka vishwas is used to further lull the intellectual divyangs who are already enchanted by sabka saath sabka vikas. Meanwhile, Giriraj Singh will abuse fellow NDA leader Nitish Kumar for attending an iftar party and the pliables will report that Amit Shah pulled him up on phone. The home minister not greeting on eid and purportedly mulling the solution of the Kashmir problem by installing a Hindu chief minister after a delimitation exercise should not be seen as exposing a communal mindset. After all, the instrument of accession was signed by a Hindu king.
In a tight slap on the face of pseudo-secularists who paint Modi as a right-wing fascist, more and more Muslims are hailing him as their saviour. Abdullakutty, an ex-Kerala MLA and a former MP of Congress, puts Modi in the same league as Gandhiji whose litmus test for a good act was to remember the face of the poorest of the poor and how he will benefit from it and who toiled selflessly for the welfare of the lowliest of the lowest. Karnataka Congress leader Roshan Baig too hailed Modi, though his detractors will say that Baig has no future in Congress and is looking for greener pastures. Muslim students will find it hard to ignore the eid gift of increase in scholarships. Many Muslim women already thank Modi for taming their husbands through his law to jail them for giving triple talaq. The doubters will see this as success of the divider in chief while the belivers will give credit to the sabka vishwas proponent. All is well and only Pakistan lovers, urban naxals and sympathisers of “Muslim party” and the Khan Market gang won’t trust Modi now.
Modi is following Krishna’s advice of performing his karma without worrying about its results. Modi supporters will attribute his second term as PM and the bigger mandate to his good karma. Modi’s opponents, on the other hand, will remind us that Modi ignored Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s advice on Rajdharma and continues to do so, and that Modi will pay for his kukarmas on the day of reckoning. The only constant in these changing times is the tussle between divisive demagoguery and inclusive egalitarianism reflected in the clash between Godse bhakts and Gandhi followers. Some will warn that the winter is coming while others will proclaim that achche din are on their way. People get the government they deserve.

Justices Nariman, Lalit and Joseph took the stand that triple talaq is not integral to the practice of Islam and isn’t protected by Article 25(1) safeguarding religious freedoms. But Justice Joseph disagreed with the Nariman-Lalit view that a colonial-era legislation surrendering “marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq” to personal law regulated triple talaq, and hence must be tested against Article 14 guaranteeing equal protection of the law.
Instead Justice Joseph, like Justices Khehar and Nazeer, reaffirmed that the law applicable to Muslims “shall only be their personal law namely Shariat” and then proceeded to ascertain whether triple talaq was sanctioned by Quran. But should judges be forced into laboured interpretations of religious laws in matters like marriage that fall within the domain of civil law? All three judgments on triple talaq conducted their own inquiries into Muslim laws, on essentially theological issues, and arrived at different interpretations.
For women coping with marital, divorce, inheritance and alimony disputes, vacuum in the statute on grounds of primacy of personal laws is a gross violation of Article 14. Justices Khehar and Nazeer, with qualified support from Justice Joseph, implored Parliament to extend the codification of laws, “an issue of paramount importance”, to Muslims too. But codification of personal laws will not end discrimination if the personal law is fundamentally discriminatory. Even the Hindu codes still have provisions that favour men over women. A Uniform Civil Code (UCC) would bring clarity, cut through the messiness necessitated by dealing with abstruse theological matters, and actualise Article 14’s promise of equality.
But UCC seems tough to achieve in today’s fractious political climate. To bring it closer, every party must drop the selective secularism it currently practises and move towards genuine secularism. This responsibility falls especially heavily on BJP and NDA as they are politically dominant in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is best placed in decades to take the initiative. He has parliamentary backing and his party manifesto promised a UCC if elected. But Modi must first win minority backing by propounding an inclusive agenda in all walks of public life. After GST on the economic front, UCC is the ultimate measure to “unify” Indian society.

     Modi and his team has same approch as any other party in this country have done in the past. Modi has gone with tripple talaq tp get some votes of muslim ladies.  Article 370 is for appeasement of hindus agiainst mislims.  Reservation for economically backward is again to divide society among rich and poor but law commission  recommendation as told by ravi shankar exposes BJP stand as there is no need for UCC in present scenario. Congress went for appeasement of dalit  and muslim  to rule this country for sixty years. Mulayam and Lalu played OBC and muslim card with ambedkar. But none of these parties tried for unify india. The constituition created controversies with directive principles and fundsmental rights which is being exploitef by both political parties and lawyers. The region based rule regarding accusition of property,  different rules regarding inheritance has further created division in the society. We look to history with pride about love among brother and sisters but amendment in inheritance law has divided them and made them rival for property. Plight of muslim on thr name of sharia law is well known fact that affuent muslim continue to grow but majority is well below povert line. Private  Insurance sector is getting boom because of govt funding but no body is checking whether  they are providing  servives or not. The previous government use to favour their supports with grant of licences and present government is favaouring adani and adwanis or reliance with granting lease to them.

A woman from Bareilly is raped multiple times by her father-in-law and then her brother-in-law at the behest of her husband, who justifies her degradation by citing ‘nikah halala’. One’s memory inadvertently brings to the fore a certain Imrana, who was declared ‘haram’ for her husband by the purveyors of faith – Deoband seminary – in 2005 after she was raped by her father-in-law.
The most disquieting and alarming circumstance before us is the ease with which we have accepted such episodes as a religious community, acquiescing to, and even justifying such monstrous pseudo-Islamic clerical and societal acts of brutality. Even though a basic reading of the largest chapter in the Quran, Surah Baqarah, should have convinced us once and for all that not only was the ill-fated talaq-e-biddat (triple talaq) of the victim not validated by the Quran, but that, even if the couple had separated, not once but twice, she could have still remarried her former husband with a mere re-solemnisation of nikah!
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-107010"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/345-illus-for-blog.jpg"" alt="""" width=""632"" height=""520"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/345-illus-for-blog.jpg 632w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/345-illus-for-blog-300x247.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px"">Illustration: Chad Crowe
But this obfuscation of the Quran sits well, most shockingly, in the conscience and conversation of most of our clergymen, and has unfortunately become the norm even for the literate and well-settled Muslim community who will immediately rush to separate couples out of wedlock as ‘haram’ or taboo to each other, at the slightest hint of a talaq pronouncement, in direct violation of the Quran and Islam. In most such instances the Quran is obeyed in the breach, and our educated, seemingly well-meaning ‘muashra’ (society) routinely ignores Quranic instructions, thereby killing the essence and substance of Islam, even before the clerical vultures move in.
We are all sickened by the fatwa against Nida Khan for her campaign against triple talaq by Shahar Imam Mufti Khurshid Alam, who has exhorted the community to deny her medicine if she were to fall ill, and refused even a grave and namaz at her ‘janaza’ (funeral procession)!
While the notorious All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) vociferously advocates ‘sharia courts’, their representatives like Mufti Aijaz Qasmi are seen brazenly abusing and beating a woman lawyer on national television in an ugly altercation, the visuals of which will be permanently ingrained in public memory.
Vote bank politics hasn’t helped the cause of justice. The track record of AIMPLB since the Shah Bano case is only too well known. It was this body that pressurised Rajiv Gandhi to issue the ordinance overturning the landmark SC judgment which granted the constitutional right of 75 year old Shah Bano, left destitute by her husband, to seek basic financial maintenance.
The unwavering political support of Congress to this perpetuation of an un-Quranic, unconstitutional practice such as talaq-e-biddat is shocking. One wonders why some zealous Islamists would seek to enforce sharia or Islamic law in a democracy like India – imagine the horrors of limb amputations and beheadings a community would force upon itself! And how many of us would be willing to give up our bank interest and everyday secular choices!
Like all other citizens Indian Muslims follow the Indian Penal Code for all civil and criminal disputes. Why does the narrative of their faith being in peril arise only in matters of family law? If they see Supreme Court intervention as an infringement of their community rights, then will their next step be to challenge the entire Penal Code including the Criminal Procedure Act which is obviously not in consonance with Islamic law as practised in theocratic states?
The rot is deep, but justice must not elude the victims of triple talaq and nikah halala forever. Actually 22 August, 2017 will stand out in the annals of Muslim Personal Law in India, as a day of constitutional justice for the innumerable victims of arbitrary clerical rulings and fatwas. On that day a five judge bench of the Supreme Court took the bull by the horns, extricated the truth from the scriptures, and declared unilateral divorce practised as talaq-e-biddat unconstitutional and un-Islamic.
The Indian judiciary has adjudicated with remarkable depth and sensitivity while interpreting the Quran, even while upholding the values of the Constitution. Conversely, the multitude of mullahs, imams and qazis, constituting a self-anointed club of Islamic scholars representing different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, dish out their own concoctions of Islamic justice.
Now there is no going back to personal law courts, darul qazas, or the age of ignorance. The most fundamental pillar of our democracy, the Indian judiciary, will uphold justice to the last woman standing.
When Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweets about standing with the last person in the line, the “exploited, marginalised and the persecuted” he refers to also include this brutalised Muslim woman. I hope he will stand with her.

     You are a hypocrite. Why do you Muslims always look up to your religious books for slolutions to the problems? Do you agree to a practice like triple talaq  or nikah  halal if your religious books sanctions them ? Wonâ  t you oppose those irrational and inhuman  provisions  of Quran which are against humanity , equality and social justice. ? All religious books like Quran or bible or Bhagavad Geeta etc are written at a particular point of time for a particular set of people living in a particular geographical area , how can they be universal ? Everything spoke or written anytime anywhere has a context of place and time individual understandings/ biases/ apprehensions of the person or person who have written them and taken beyond the context and applying to all times and places is absolute nonsense. By the way if you are so liberal and progressive , then why are you in a party whose only agenda is hate for Muslims and minorities and filled with Hindu fundamentalists and gau rakshaks Lynch mobs and religious hooligans ?...

1. Maternity leave duration has increased to surpass most developed nations
2. Triple Talaq has been banned for 6 months during which the Central Government is expected to pass a law banning Triple Talaq for good
3. The appointment of Nirmala Sitharaman as the first fulltime female Defence Minister
Niramala Sitharaman is India’s second female Defence Minister, before her Indira Gandhi held the same portfolio and was the Prime Minsiter as well. But Nirmala Sitharaman is the first fulltime female Defence Minister of India.

Indira Gandhi was the Iron Lady of India, well known for her strong tactical methods of fighting terrorism. Nationally, she had given the green light to extreme measures to claimed terrorists that were murdered in a bloodbath at the Golden Temple – Amritsar, in Operation Bluestar. She also took forward the nuclear program of India started under the leadership of Nehru, she gave verbal authorization of an underground nuclear test called “Smiling Buddha” in Rajasthan which caused ire to then Pakistan Prime Minsiter Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. On an international front, Operation Meghdoot was a success in the Siachen conflict. Not only that, but under Indira Gandhi’s leadership West Pakistan was liberated from East Pakistan, without Indira Gandhi’s support perhaps the creation of Bangladesh as a separate country would not have been possible. Indira Gandhi was a swift decision maker, tough, and unflinching in her use of strategized force against any threat whether internal or external. To top it off, Indira Gandhi was a woman and one of the strongest Defence Minsiter’s the nation has seen since its conception.
Apparently the media has forgotten our rich history of having a female leader who had proven much more effective and tougher than most defence ministers, all of whom were men. This forgetfulness has been keeping our newly appointed Defence Minister NIrmala Sitharaman in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. The question that everybody is asking – has she been appointed because she is a woman? Is this entire situation staged and politically motivated? If Nirmala were a man she wouldn’t be asked so many questions, most of which are based on her gender and her effectiveness as a leader.
To the people who are bringing up her gender as an issue I would like to state the obvious, patriarchy is a deep rooted social evil in India. It is a complicated issue and to have a role model, a woman in the role of Defence Minister which is highly stigmatized as being a male dominated occupation, is called breaking the glass ceiling. In this lifetime we are witness to glass ceiling in politics, and this glass ceiling has been broken directly by the Prime Minister Office. Our BJP government is traditionally believed to be an extremely patriarchal mindset, and politics a field where people are appointed based on the pull that they have. Nirmala Sitharaman has been able to bypass both categories, this is a milestone in the success of women of our nation.
There are currently two women in India who are extremely powerful: Sushma Swaraj the Foreign Minister and Niramala Sitharaman in the CCS (Cabinet Committee of Security). They consist of Narendra Modi’s CCS which has a total of five members including himself, with Rajnath Singh as Home Minster and Arun Jaitley as Minister of Finance. If one is observant than one will notice that the male counterparts in the CCS (with the exception of the Prime Minister) are superseded by women who have been provided much more powerful roles.
So why is Nirmala Sitharaman a viable candidate as the Minister of Defence? Nirmala Sitharaman has worked as a member of the National Commission for Women, is a Rajya Sabha member, and was a Minister of State for Commerce. She had started her path as a spokesperson for BJP in the election which saw Narendra Modi win with a landslide. Since then she gained popularity in BJP and was discovered by Sushma Swaraj in the NCW and has been known as a woman who gets work done immediately. Sitaraman has emerged as the Minister of Defence directly noticed and appointed by the Prime Minsiter Office due to her virtue of being a go-getter and a great worker for the nation, tokenism has no role in this appointment. Of course there will be a lot of learning to do, she might take a good 4 – 5 months of learning (just like her predecessors) before being able to grasp the in’s and outs of her profile, but she is smart enough, capable enough and dedicated enough to do justice.
As is famously said in India, you can tell the flavor of rice by taking one look at a grain. Recently, our newly appointed Defence Minister was seen in China for a BRICS meeting and she engaged in discussion on Doklam with her counterparts. Her official commencement of duties is from the 6th of September, 2017 but she jumped headlong into her role beforehand showing her commitment and understanding of the great task before her.

This Act, in substance, declared the triple talaq, ie talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq, illegal. Any Muslim husband who pronounces such talaq to his wife can suffer imprisonment for a term of three years and also be liable for fine.
The offence under this law is cognisable only if the information given to the police is either by the married Muslim woman to whom the talaq is pronounced or by any person related to her by blood or marriage. This is designed to prevent misuse by outsiders. Under the Act, bail can be granted only after hearing the victim woman and on reasonable grounds.
There is provision for subsistence allowance for the wife and her dependent children as determined by the magistrate, including the right of the wife for the custody of her minor children. Significantly, the offence punishable under the Act has also been made compoundable but only at the insistence of the Muslim woman and with the permission of the magistrate on appropriate terms, which the court may determine.
It is indeed a sad commentary that in spite of more than 20 Islamic countries having regulated triple talaq in one form or the other, it took us more than 70 years since Independence to pass such a law in Parliament, after so much opposition and campaign by vested interests. I had repeatedly argued in Parliament that this legislation is only designed for gender justice, equity and empowerment and has no religious overtones at all.

Should an India be governed by constitutional principles including fundamental rights, which so proudly proclaim gender justice and empowerment, allow a big segment of our women to suffer this rank discrimination, that too when majority of the victims came from economically weaker sections? Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very clear that the government must work to ensure justice to victims of triple talaq, support their cause in the court and also bring out a robust law.
While doing the homework for the Bill, I was distressed to learn about many instances wherein triple talaq, irrevocably annulling the marriage, was pronounced for the flimsiest of reasons – which included food not being cooked properly, or the wife waking up late in the morning. An IT professional, who reached out to me, had to suffer the ignominy of triple talaq through WhatsApp from her husband from a Middle Eastern country, because her third child was also a daughter.
Today is also the occasion for me to salute the great courage shown by many Muslim women organisations and victims, who took up this cause and challenged it in court. The Supreme Court ultimately declared triple talaq as unconstitutional in a majority judgment. Two judges declared triple talaq to be manifestly arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
All India Muslim Personal Law Board vehemently argued before the court that they will themselves educate their community against this form of divorce and the court shouldn’t intervene. Regrettably, instead of educating their community effectively they took the lead in opposing the proposed law itself when it was under parliamentary scrutiny.
Our post-Independence history has always witnessed progressive laws designed to curb instances of atrocities against women. Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, or Section 32 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005, or Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to cruelty against a woman by her husband or his relatives, are all cognisable and non-bailable offences and they are religion neutral. Further, Section 304B of the IPC made the offence punishable with life imprisonment if death because of harassment of the wife occurs within seven years of marriage. Requisite amendments were also made under the Evidence Act about presumption of abetment to suicide and dowry death.
In 2018, we amended Section 376 of the IPC where deterrent punishments of death in case of rape has been provided if the victim is 12 years or below in age. I need to acknowledge that all these legislations were supported over the years by all the political parties where religion of the offender or victim was irrelevant. Why is it that in case of triple talaq, such progressive evolution of India’s society and polity was found to be wavering? The only inference is that from Shah Bano in 1985 to Shayara Bano in 2017, vote bank politics continued to dominate vested political interests at great cost to Muslim women.
While moving the Bill in the Parliament, I had shared statistics on the continuation of practice of triple talaq even after the judgment of the SC. I am happy to learn that the department of minority affairs has elaborately examined the state wise data, after getting feedback from various Waqf Boards and other sources, and found out a significant decline in number of cases of triple talaq after the enactment of this law, as compared to the number reported earlier. Further, in many cases, respectable compromise has also been achieved. This is an assuring sign of empowerment and redemption. Getting this historic legislation passed by the Parliament was indeed personally very satisfying for me.

     This is a one side story regarding harassment of a female gender. This is good that the things have been strengthened to safeguard the interests of females. But, in the society,opposit also happens. There are numerous instances where the wife is rich and due to her financial muscle, she harasses the husband,treat her in laws like dirt  and for her, there is no rule to control her offensive activities. If, from husband side,some body try to pursuade her, she slaps false cases of MarPeet against inlaws and her husband after bribing police using her parent's influence.If husband, wants the divorce, she will not give divorce and she will not allow the inlaws to meet her child. There are thousand of such false cases running  in the courts in India but girl takes the advantage of her being a female.In such cases,judge also understands the situation but cases drag on for years and husband doesn't get divorce while there is no fault of him to bring the marriage to this situation. Government should settle such cases strictly within a certain time limit of max 2 years making the law tough which will be a great relief to Male genders being harassed in such cases in our society. Above is a real story and there are thousand such stories for the harassment of males where females have upper hand....  Read More

"1616953845-245","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=triple+talaq","A law unto themselves: Why Triple Talaq should be abolished","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/Undertheinfluence/a-law-unto-themselves-why-triple-talaq-should-be-abolished/","A law unto themselves: Why Triple Talaq should be abolished","May 15, 2017, 1:02 AM  IST","Indrajit Hazra","There’s once upon a time. The Flipkart delivery guy always rings twice. But India remains the only country in the world where the triple talaq remains law. Which means that an Indian Muslim man, by the power invested in Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, can, like the Beatles chorus line of ‘Back in the US/ Back in the US/ Back in the USSR’, divorce his wife by simply uttering ‘talaq, talaq, talaq’.
For a country that defines its secularism not along the thick line of separation between religion and state but by the all-embracing Article 14 of the Constitution — ‘The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law and equal protection of laws within the territory of India’ — circa 2017 India sure knows how to treat all laws as equal, but some laws more equal than others.
The Supreme Court, currently hearing arguments for petitions challenging the validity of the triple talaq, could soon well be discussing arguments pertaining to how many angels can be allowed to dance on a pinhead.
Personal laws based on various religious groupings have been allowed to exist in secular India. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, for instance, provides guidelines for property inheritance among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.
Similarly, the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, and the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, can be jollily used by Parsis and Hindus respectively if they choose to override the rather ironically named Special Marriage Act, which applies irrespective of the religion of those getting married. Congressman-lawyer Kapil Sibal has been arguing the case on behalf of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).
On Friday, he argued before the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar that triple talaq was a “non-issue” because the practice was “optional”. That’s like saying prenatal sex determination would’ve been a non-issue if it had been made optional. The case being made that instances of triple talaq are rare and, therefore, inconsequential — “No prudent Muslim would wake up one fine morning and say ‘Talaq, talaq and talaq’,” says the prudent Sibal — is made to fit the larger argument of ‘personal matters’ being protected from the orangutan arms of the law. This has been the ‘liberal’ argument of ‘respecting customs’, even when they come in direct conflict with Indian law.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-86904"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triple-talaq-bccl.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triple-talaq-bccl.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triple-talaq-bccl-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
Sibal may remember what followed in the wake of the Shah Bano verdict in 1985 in which Bano had challenged the Muslim Personal Law that denied her alimony. In 1986, the Government of India overturned the Supreme Court judgement that granted her alimony. It, therefore, overturned the law, by facilitating the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act that allowed ‘maintenance’ to a divorced Muslim woman “till 90 days after the divorce”, again “according to the provisions of Islamic law”. Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was to provide Shah Bano justice like any other Indian woman, was kicked out of one of Parliament’s chhajja-shaded windows.
And the modern usage of the word ‘appeasement’ was born. The AIMPLB, like Asterix’s Gaulish village holding out against the Roman Empire, has successfully portrayed itself as the protector of the ‘Muslim way of life’, which is being threatened by an overriding, hostile force that sees religion as irrelevant. But when one confronts those ‘occasional’ triple talaq cases, or even the ‘rarer’ ones of nikah halala — such as the one reported in October last year when a Muslim man from Jaipur drugged his wife and forced her to have sex with a friend, since by conducting nikah halala, “a woman must consummate her marriage with another man if she wants to go back to her former husband, with whom she has been divorced” — one comes to the borderline of moral relativism.
If the Uttar Pradesh elections showed one thing, it was that entities such as the AIMPLB hold very few in their sway these days. The Supreme Court is investigating whether “something which is considered abhorrent by religion [Islam] be validated by law”.
The real question is whether the law of the land can be flicked aside in the name of protecting any grouping, whether based on religion or shoe size. It’s time to roll out the Uniform Civil Code.

     it was rousseau who asserted (rightly in that context) that man can be forced to be free. today&#039;s world, particularly our india, must move ahead.  india can not move ahead with obscurantism, bigotry, illiteracy, and lack of enlightenment.  laws must move along with time.  people who are supporting the continuation of triple talaq and or any such nonsense in any religion in india, should be forced to read ms. may&#039;s --mother india.  that book written in 1927 shows what india was then and how indian women, en masse were kept at the bottom of the piles.  the soviet union moved ahead skipping two steps in historical progression, for communism liberated women and treated them as equals.  usa is way ahead, because here, women are free.  india must do it, if needed, by changing the obscurantist laws and practices en masse!  in the alter of a nation&#039;s dedication and desire to move ahead with time, there can be no compromise, come what may.  for the muslims, kemal ataturk should be the leader to look to.  as a person who grew up in india, a third world, he was our role model, so were some of our great leaders leading india to independence.  we cannot slow down, nor can we delay progress in the name of religion or customs, make it any religion and custom....

It has said that the bill which bans the practice of instant divorce within the Muslim community will empower Muslim women. However, this is only partially true. True, instant triple talaq is a reprehensible practice where Muslim women are at a clear disadvantage. In India, there have been perverse cases where husbands have pronounced triple talaq through SMSes and postcards and these have been sanctified by the Muslim clergy and the Muslim Personal Law Board.
Besides, neither can it be claimed that triple talaq is intrinsic to Islam given that the practice is prohibited in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Plus, most of the petitioners against triple talaq have been Muslim women, exemplifying that the practice doesn’t have universal acceptance within the community itself. In fact, even according to Islamic tradition, instant triple talaq is a distortion as uttering talaq three times in one sitting isn’t normal and is considered as one talaq. This is supposed to be followed by mediation and attempts at reconciliation.
And given that the Supreme Court in 2017 had ruled that triple talaq was unconstitutional on grounds of violating equality, it is welcome that the practice has been proscribed through legislation now. However, the triple talaq bill does take things a bit too far by criminalising the practice and mandating jail terms of up to three years for those Muslim men who continue to use the instant divorce instrument. Also, making the practice a cognisable offence where the police itself can file an FIR does constitute overreach. After all, matters of marriage and divorce, not amounting to violence, torture or blackmail, should be treated as civil issues. Relationships are complex and simply making triple talaq an illegal form of divorce should have been sufficient.
This is where one needs to focus on really empowering not just Muslim women but all women. And the key to this is to ensure women’s education, employment and right to property. The power asymmetry that women have to deal with in society stems from the fact that patriarchy has systematically denied women access to financial assets and factors of production over generations. And this cuts across religions. In this respect, women’s employment in India is in a grave situation. The female employment rate in the country – counting both the formal and informal economy – has fallen from 35% in 2005 to just 26% now. Moreover, according to the latest periodic labour force survey data published by NSSO, Muslim women in the country have the lowest labour force participation rate.
It is this issue that the government needs to fix to empower Muslim women in particular and women in general. Deep thought needs to be given to improving the overall environment to boost women’s employment. There are obstacles here that range from security concerns to workplace sexism. And there are no quick fix solutions. For example, something like six months of paid maternity leave for women employees can backfire and see firms hire less women due to the added obligation. Commensurate paid paternity leave or a form of co-share child care leave is the solution.
Hence, the government’s intention to empower Muslim women is commendable. But real results will only show with measures to improve women’s employment overall. Those are still awaited.

Speaking with TOI, Amber discussed Muslims having to chant ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’, ending triple talaq, inviting Mohan Bhagwat to a mosque – and tackling Islamophobia and Muslim misogyny:
Scholars say triple talaq is un-Islamic – why isn’t there a strong movement to ban it in India? 
Yes, it is un-Islamic – our board was formed to nullify this system and fight such evil practices.
In 2005, our board launched a model ‘nikahnama’ that clearly states this system is un-Islamic and also nullifies talaq given through SMS, email or telephone.
Women have been fighting over years – recently, there’s been a strong revolt among educated Muslim women.
Yet, male-dominated society strategically ignores their voices – except for a few, most religious clergies prefer women to live behind their veils and abide by the rules set by male chauvinists.
Some observors feel Indian secularism appeased Muslim men, leaving women like Shah Bano exploited – what’s your view?
Well, the talaq given to Shah Bano was wrong.
Muslim men giving talaq thus is not at all acceptable.
Why are certain shrines now trying to stop Muslim women’s entry – isn’t that against Islam’s tenets of equality?
Islam encourages women to take part in religious activities. During Haj, men and women worship together.
For paying respect at shrines like Ajmer Sharif or Haji Ali Dargah, authorities should not ban women – in fact, they should arrange halls for women to come and learn the teachings of the holy saint.
You’ve invited RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to visit a Lucknow mosque – will you also visit a Hindu temple and join the rituals there? 
Why not? When i was young, i used to wake up in the wee hours to pray, hearing the morning azaan. This was followed by chants in a nearby temple. Later, i saw the prabhat toli every morning.
I married an Urdu, Persian and Sanskrit scholar – whose first book was on Buddha. I respect every religion and believe their basic teachings are the same. The Quran also tells us to focus on similarities, not differences.
I’ve visited mandirs, gurdwaras and churches and would readily accept invitations from my non-Muslim brothers.
You’ve spoken with Mohan Bhagwat – do you agree with those claiming his motive is to establish Hindutva in India? 
Well, i felt he spoke strongly about our rich Indian culture and how to preserve and promote Bhartiya sanskriti. He also spoke about the nation’s development.
Regarding motives to establish India as a Hindu nation, i think this would be answered best by Mohan Bhagwat himself.
What do you feel about the ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ controversy?
Our religion teaches us to be loyal to our nation – this loyalty towards our motherland completes our faith.
I pose a question to our non-Muslim brothers though – is that the only parameter to judge a Muslim’s faithfulness to their country?
For me, my country was, is and will forever be the greatest country in the world – as an Indian Muslim woman, this is not just where i live. It is part of my identity.
But chants should be a personal choice – even Mohan Bhagwat said that no one should be forced to say ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’, so why are people creating such a hullabaloo regarding this? Who are they to judge a person’s loyalty to his nation?
Who gave them the right to declare anyone a deshdrohi?
Our Constitution never forces such ideas on citizens – and no one is above the law.
Speaking of law, is the beef ban fair?
Personally, i think where people from different faiths coexist, for the sentiments of our Hindu brothers, we should not consume beef.
But this is not only about eating – it’s also a huge industry that generates business via leather products.
Government should take this into consideration. Thousands of people earn their bread and butter through this industry.
Islamophobia’s spread – what do you feel about Donald Trump’s views on banning Muslims from entering the US? 
One whose family history is of immigrants from other nations should not say this – it only reflects his hate for a particular sect.
More than us, it’s on Americans now to prove what kind of leader they want – they will decide whether to appreciate or dump Trump.

Some may believe the recent Supreme Court ruling enforcing reform promotes secularism, in fact it does the opposite.
So should the state – government, legislature, or court – never intervene in religious practices? What about the banning of sati, caste discrimination and, as happened recently, instant triple talaq? There, i believe the state was justified in intervening. What is the distinction, you ask? Plenty.
Before addressing the differences from those situations, it is important to understand that the prevailing Indian iteration of secularism is different from what the term usually means in modern democracies, which is separation of church and state. This was discussed in this column earlier. As should only be expected, India’s attempt to “treat all religions equally” is plagued by subjectivity that undermines secularism.
This subjectivity has led to a bizarre situation, where the majority religion in India experiences extraordinary interference from the state, unlike anything seen elsewhere. It is almost as if the Indian state distrusts Hindus and, throwing aside all pretence of secularism, exercises direct control over their religious institutions.

In India, places of worship of Hinduism, and Hinduism alone, experience the following: control and management by government including altering religious rituals; government control over administrative and financial decisions including diverting income for other purposes; temple income subject to tax; government role in the management of educational institutes run by religious bodies; ban on preferential hiring within the faith if the institute receives government funding; and so on.
While some of these may make sense in principle, such as non-discriminatory hiring by institutes availing government funds, it is simply unfathomable why this ought to apply to only one religion. And provisions like government administrators having final say on temple rituals of only one religion, besides indicating systemic bias, are decidedly non-secular by any standard.
This kind of state interference in religion is peculiar. There are theistic states that discriminate against religions other than the official one (think Pakistan or Saudi Arabia). There were and are theistic states that behave in a somewhat secular manner, with much greater tolerance of non-official religions (think of the late Ottoman Empire or present day Dubai). There are secular states that are perceived to exercise bias in favour of the majority religion (Turkey in recent years). But India seems to be unique, the only democratic, secular republic that meddles in the places of worship of only one religion, that of the majority population.
So what about those other religious reforms that came about through state intervention? Surely, we must all agree that banning sati, untouchability, and instant triple talaq are good things? Yes, absolutely. However, there are two distinctions between those and the restrictions at temples in Sabarimala, Puri and the like. Both are well-demonstrated with examples from India as well as the US, the democratic republic with the oldest and deepest commitment to separation of church and state.
First, the state has a responsibility for each citizen’s individual constitutional rights that transcend the rights of the religious group to which he or she may belong. The classic example is the US Supreme Court’s ruling that a child’s immunisation cannot be dispensed with because the adults in her religion deem it against their faith.
India’s prohibition on sati, caste discrimination and instant triple talaq fall in this category, making it entirely rational for the state to intervene to ensure the citizen’s individual rights. These issues impact citizens in their everyday life, and our Constitution mandates that the state ensure equality for all.
This idea is further embellished by a contrarian US Supreme Court ruling, entitling a baker to refuse to sell cake for same sex weddings on the basis of his religious beliefs. While this has dismayed some, the underlying principle has a certain consistency (think of a Jewish or Muslim butcher refusing to sell pork). The disappointed couple can find an alternative baker, whereas a child whose immunisation is blocked by parents on religious grounds has only the state to aid her health.
The second distinction about the state intervening in the practices at a place of worship, as opposed to citizens’ daily life in the wider world, is the venue itself. While it is every citizen’s prerogative to practice any religion, or none, it cannot be every individual’s right to impose his version of a religion on others who profess it. Thus, while he may practice religion as he pleases in private, in a religion’s place of group worship, the rituals, subject to not harming anyone, must reflect the group consensus.
Treating a place of worship like an office or a college will not work. Female college students often assert their right to wear clothing of their choice on campus, and rightly so. But no visitor to a Buddhist stupa or Sikh gurdwara, man or woman, would insist on violating their dress codes. Similarly, many mosques in the UK seat women only at the back, and while their government would not countenance such segregation in buses, this it considers the business of the congregation.

Right from the days is EVE, women were allegedly been  termed as temptresses , not because of their positive role in distracting  the wavering mind of their counterparts, but of the inherenr flawed creation of men, with a  capricious mind, succumbing to the slightest provocation of even uninvited seduction or allurements.

Later, though, he said he did authorise Ajit Pawar to talk to Devendra Fadnavis. Today everybody knows that NCP has gained the most in the coalition of Maha Vikas Aghadi. This all, therefore, was a clever and deliberate move of Sharad Pawar asserting his importance in the given situation indicating that his options were open enough ensuring an automatic tilt in favour of NCP without much bargaining. An example of the fine art of political maneuvering!
When Nitish Kumar supported Citizenship Amendment Bill every eyebrow raised. Was this the same Nitish having somewhat different stand of triple talaq, Art 370 and other contentious issues. Even his own senior leaders like Pawan Varma resented the move publically. Prashant Kishor, a leader owing his all the political base to Nitish, appeared too harsh to Nitish in criticizing his support to CAB, so much so, a revolt in JD (U) appeared imminent. And then Prashant met the Bihar CM, reportedly offered to resign, which was rejected by Nitish. Coming out of CM’s residence Prashant said Nitish would not allow NRC in Bihar and started giving cryptic statements against CAA provoking non BJP CMs and others to come out against NRC. Nitish kept conspicuous silence, while almost every day there were provocative statements from Prashant. Suddenly Prashant Kishor started talking over seat sharing for upcoming Bihar assembly elections telling JD (U) must get more, and not 50-50 seats, keeping in view mathematics that he could show. Now Sushil Modi Dy CM of Bihar joined Prashant’s statement questioning his political credentials and telling Prashant that top leaders of both the parties would only take the call on seat sharing. Nitish still kept an arm’s length to this debate by his Vice President said to be the number two and very close to him. He commented with one liner, “Sab theek hai” with the alliance.
On whose behalf, then, Prashant Kishor has been talking. He may be a political naïve but he remains an expert of political arithmetic and academic. Understandably, he must not be talking without having implicit mandate from Nitish. But why Nitish should do this especially in view of repeated assertions by BJP – including by Amit Shah and Sushil Modi – that the elections would be fought with him as the Chief Ministerial candidate? After all what is going on in Sushasan Babu’s mind? Let’s try have a look on the inherent equations and expectations!
Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar have been, are and always would be, at the daggers drawn relationship notwithstanding BJP- JD (U) long partnership in Bihar, at least since the days Narendra Modi was selected to lead BJP. As soon as Narendra Modi was appointed BJP’s campaign committee chairman, Nitish made known his displeasure and opposition and did everything to personally humiliate him. He broke the years long alliance with BJP in June 2013 itself dismissing all BJP ministers with him. With 115 MLAs of his party then, he easily won the trust vote with thumping numbers in 243 member assembly with support of Lalu’s RJD (22 members) and few independents. That was the time Nitish was riding on his success wave doing too well in Bihar and at times was whispered by media having a Prime Ministerial potential.
But Narendra Modi had a big win in 2014 general elections and Nitish could draw only two seats. Taking responsibility, he resigned as Chief Minister in May 2014 only, making one of his confidents, Jitanram Manjhi, a most backward leader, the Chief Minister. But soon there was series of crises in govt as well as in his party. By the time Nitish wanted to come back, Manjhi grew power ambitions apparently pampered by BJP to revolt against Nitish with an aim to sideline Nitish. But Nitish always had very firm grip over the party. There were too many expulsions in the party, revolt in Manjhi cabinet itself leading to a split but Nitish could come back in Feb 2015 with Manjhi being sacked from the party and stepping down for want of numbers and forming his own party.
BJP central leaders did everything to support Manjhi playing mahadalit card foolishly unaware of the fact that he had most negligible support even in his community. This was when Nitish got support from almost every party and group except BJP – from Mayawati to Mamata to Lalu to Rahul and mahagathbandhan took shape.
Before 2015 assembly elections, Nitish could maneuver mahagathbandhan leaders, especially Mulayam Singh to prevail upon Lalu to declare Nitish as Chief Ministerial candidate of the coalition. Thus Nitish could once again prove his indispensability of CM chair. Though he could get lesser numbers in 2015 elections than Lalu’s RJD (71:81),he could become CM. Again, this was his brickmanship.
But with two of Lalu’s sons – Tejashwi and Tej Pratap – sitting on his shoulder in the cabinet, with the one as Dy Chief Minister, it was just not possible for Nitish to run the show without compromising his clean credentials. And as the circumstances would unfold, the CBI filed an FIR naming Lalu Prasad’s Dy CM son too in railway land acquisition affair. This made Nitish to get rid of RJD. He resigned on 26th July 2017 only to be sworn in on 27th July, the very next day as NDA Chief Minister – again Nitish could get his way very much tactfully.
BJP has never been too strong in Bihar. In none of the elections of assembly, BJP got better tally than JD (U). Even in general elections BJP-LJP (Lok Jan Sakti of Ram Vilas Paswan) combine could get only 31. Of course, JD (U) too could get only 2. But in 2019 BJP-JD(U)-LJP combine could get 40 out of 41 seats of Bihar. In fact, BJP does not have any leader of good mass appeal in Bihar.
And therefore, JD (U) of Bihar has become NCP of Maharashtra. It can take RJD with it and lead the govt. RJD without Lalu Prasad is almost having the existential crisis and would be happy getting Nitish to regain its grounds. It can remain with BJP and enjoy continuity. But BJP does not have any other way to go except going with JD (U). It cannot ally either with RJD or with Congress.
Thus Nitish is more important to BJP than BJP to Nitish. Nitish has not forgotten leaders like Radhamohan Singh or Giriraj Singh making harsh comments against Nitish post 2017. He must not have forgotten some BJP leaders showing him exit door too. But now, BJP has to be more soft, sober and giving to Nitish lest it risks Bihar power. It would do well to give it the proportional representation in the Union Cabinet than offering symbolic one place. It should also show more helpfulness to Nitish initiatives in the state. It has to change its attitude towards its allies in general and towards JD (U) quite urgently. The time and tide appear to be favoring Nitish!

"1616953146-85","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/11/?s=triple+talaq","Uniform Civil Code: Drawing the line between religion and law","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/arise-awake-and-stop-not/uniform-civil-code-drawing-the-line-between-religion-and-law/","Uniform Civil Code: Drawing the line between religion and law","September 18, 2017, 1:45 PM  IST","Lalita Nijhawan","Amendments have been made in all personal laws, except for Muslim Personal Law which until recently witnessed the Supreme Court’s historic verdict against instantaneous Triple Talaq (Talaq e biddat). As expected, some Muslim religious groups have come together to oppose the Supreme Court’s judgment stating that it interferes with their religion. Massive hullabaloo’s have been ensuing for decades due to religious and judicial discrimination, where do we draw the line?
The infamous Shah Bano case of 1985 was presented in front of a five judge bench, they unanimously decided to overturn the appeal and keep with the High Court’s decision to provide maintenance to 70 year old estranged wife Shah Bano. This decision caused uproar amongst orthodox Muslims who said “This is an attack on our personal law, this is an attack on our religion.” The fear wasn’t limited to one court case, but the subsequent fear of diminishing practices and rituals which they have been practicing in the name of Islam. The fear was overturned with a law which allowed maintenance to be paid only for the period of ‘iddat’. Wasn’t this religious appeasement taking precedence above human rights, above gender equality? It turned out to be a victory of religious groups, and failure of law.
The main conflict that personal laws face is the prejudice and upkeep of patriarchal norms which are in many cases unrelated to the religion that they have risen from. With the exception of Muslim Personal Law, all other personal laws are inching towards an egalitarian approach of treating women with the dignity and respect she deserves. There has come an understanding that maintenance is required by a dependent spouse, a majority of these cases are of women who are dependent on their husband. An understanding has also arisen in the form of changing divorce laws, domestic violence laws, and moreover property succession laws. From what can be seen now none of the religions of India whether it is Hinduism, Christianity, and Parsi’s are facing a threat to their existence. Each religious group celebrates special occasions with full zeal and in respect to their customs and practices, now it’s just done without gender inequality.
In the Supreme Court Talaq e biddat was termed by the opposing counsel as ‘sinful but legal’. Isn’t the word ‘sin’ enough in terms of religion to keep one away from an act that is reprehensible by God?
The question not only arises regarding the process of Talaq e biddat, but when a husband realizes that in a fit of anger he has made a mistake and the toil his now estranged wife has to go through. The aftermath is the horrifying and well known as ‘Niqaah halala’. These funny rules do not empower women, nor does it do justice to a relationship which with each hurdle diminishes the chance to be salvaged.
Whenever a religious group will come forward to take a stand against the Supreme Court’s decision I would like to remind them of the following reasons as to why talaq e biddat is unconstitutional, and an insult to women everywhere. Talaq e biddat doesn’t respect women, it is derogatory, it doesn’t allow a husband and wife to exit the union as they had entered it which is through an equal opportunity to make a sound decision, and it especially isn’t endorsed in religious documents with the vehemence with which its being fought for.
We are living in a progressive world, globally there are so many countries that does not accept Talaq e biddat as a legal method of having a divorce, India being a so called progressive nation is the one country which is lagging behind! Up till now this was done due to appeasement for votes, I hope and believe that the appeasement done henceforth will be based on moral integrity and will create gender justice.

Elected to Lok Sabha a remarkable 10 times, hurling speech after thundering speech, taking opposition attacks on the chin, when Vajpayee was PM it was sometimes so difficult to get him out of the House, that government files had to be taken to his Parliament office.
Vajpayee followed the example of his self-confessed role model, Jawaharlal Nehru, the original parliamentarian-PM who not only attended Parliament almost every day but prepared painstaking replies to all questions directed at him. Nehru and Vajpayee would have recoiled in horror at the Modi government’s recent decision to virtually abandon a long established parliamentary tradition – question hour.

Question hour in Parliament is an hour when MPs get to cross-question and interrogate ministers on urgent issues, a crucial democratic institution by which peoples’ representatives hold a powerful executive accountable. The government last week decided that for the upcoming monsoon session it was going to “do away temporarily with question hour due to the extraordinary situation caused by Covid”. Question hour is to be drastically truncated: No questions can be asked extempore, only written questions are to be submitted beforehand to which ministers will give scripted answers.
To use Covid as an excuse to restrict Parliament is highly disingenuous. In fact, it is now more crucial than ever that the government is questioned on access to healthcare and mass unemployment. However, in India coronavirus is seriously endangering the health of democracy by increasing the stranglehold of government and disenfranchising citizens. The pandemic is leading to a dangerous spike in state power and a loss of basic citizens’ rights and freedoms, a democracy deficit which may haunt us even after Covid recedes.
Yet even before Covid, there’s been a systematic dilution of parliamentary practices with ceaseless disruptions and decreasing time for genuine debate and questions. Neither Modi, nor the principal face of the opposition Rahul Gandhi, have distinguished themselves in Parliament. Rahul opted not to lead his party in the House, choosing Mallikarjun Kharge in 2014 and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in 2019, the latter known primarily for feisty lung power than parliamentary intellect.
In the 16th Lok Sabha, Rahul didn’t ask a single question in question hour. Modi hardly devotes much time to the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate, staying silent during contentious parliamentary debates like triple talaq and Article 370 last year. As Gujarat chief minister he was not known to be a regular in the Vidhan Sabha: In fact, assembly sessions in Gandhinagar were often cut short.
The main reason for the rising disdain for Parliament among top politicians is the increasing disjunction between electability and parliamentary performance. You don’t need Parliament to win elections. In previous decades, fiery parliamentary talents like Bhupesh Gupta, Nath Pai, Minoo Masani or Vajpayee derived their political standing from their parliamentary record. Today a media-saturated politics has created personality cults which short-circuit Parliament.
National and state elections are fought around the personality of the supreme leader, so that most individual MPs and MLAs are faceless, lacking their own identities. They are surrogates coasting along in the backwash of a supremo-centred  wave. It was the Modi persona that dominated a majority of  the  543 Lok Sabha constituencies in 2014 and 2019. At the start of Covid, MPLADS (financial allotments to MPs for development work) was suspended, further reducing MPs’ status and links with their constituencies. In Bengal Mamata Banerjee is a similarly dominant leader. In fact question hour has also been cancelled in the forthcoming Bengal assembly session.
Parliament is also becoming irrelevant because of the fundamental de-legitimisation of debate across our intensely polarised society. Because of this deep divide across all levels of society asking any kind of question is seen as politically motivated or loaded with “agenda”. Only when genuine debate – and not the meaningless TV shouting match – is re-legitimised, can Parliament see the return of substantive debate.
A polarised society is bound to have a dysfunctional Parliament. An example of political hyper polarisation was seen in the recent controversy over the parliamentary standing committee on IT and its decision to summon Facebook for allegations of political bias. Parliamentary committees are supposed to be bipartisan spaces to take up citizens’ issues. Instead there was an unseemly confrontation between BJP’s Nishikant Dubey and the chairman Congress’s Shashi Tharoor for summoning Facebook in the first place. Instead of Facebook being asked to explain itself, politicians publicly scrapped with each other.
Governments with hefty majorities scorn parliamentary norms. There is the normalisation of the ordinance route. Ordinances were meant for extraordinary situations but today they’re freely used signalling an impatience with debate. From the nullification of Article 370 which was rammed through without an extended debate to amendments to the Aadhaar Bill which in 2016 was passed as a money bill (requiring only a yes in the Lok Sabha), government diktats have taken the place of legislative deliberations. Importantly, there’s also been a steady decline in the number of days Parliament sits. The first Lok Sabha had 677 sittings, the 16th only 226. When a government refuses to be questioned or challenged, Parliament ceases to matter.
In fact in India the more powerful a politician, the less likely they are to submit to no-holds-barred questioning, seen in the fact that neither Sonia Gandhi nor Modi hold open press conferences. This regal scorn for questions befits a monarchy, not a modern 21st century democracy.
Ironically, while downsizing the value of  parliamentary traditions, the Modi government has proposed constructing a new Parliament building under its new Central Vista project. But instead of another brick and mortar structure, gleaming on the outside but potentially hollow on the inside, why not build better democracy within Parliament instead?

While politicians are a little wary of wading into a subject that is before the Supreme Court, a proxy war is in the offing over a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) for India.
The Law Commission, whose role is purely advisory , has begun consultations on a theme that finds mention in the Directive Principles of the Constitution but has never been acted on. This in turn has provoked protests by Muslim organisations, including the Muslim Personal Law Board. Following the Union government’s affidavit in the triple talaq case and the Prime Minister’s intervention in the matter, there is a feeling that the proposed reform of Muslim divorce procedures is the thin edge of the wedge. Despite finance minister Arun Jaitley’s clarification, Muslim groups -alas, very male dominated -believe that the BJP is set to act on its long-standing commitment to a UCC.
That the outlawing of triple talaq is certain to be a feature of any future UCC is undeniable. The belief in common personal laws is centred on two planks. First, there is the belief that all citizens must be governed by the same laws governing marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption. These laws in turn must be based on contemporary values that ensure equity and gender justice.Secondly , the advocacy of a UCC proceeds on the belief that religion involves the relationship between an individual and hisher God and that modification of custom doesn’t constitute a challenge to faith or religious identities. India is unlikely to ever accept, say, French secular traditions that even frown upon the outward trappings of religious identity . A UCC, for example, may insist on the registration of marriages (and the laws governing divorce) but it will not dictate the rites and rituals of the ceremony itself. Muslims in Europe and North America haven’t lost their faith simply because they are governed by laws applicable to all citizens. And even in India, Muslims are governed by common criminal laws and not those stipulated in the Sharia.
In any case, the formulation of a UCC for India is still a long way off. The Law Commission may have begun preliminary consultations on the subject but the exercise of reconciling different personal laws of the various communities is certain to be an elaborate affair and must be accompanied by a large measure of consultation, persuasion and accommodation. To suggest that the Narendra Modi government is intent on ramming a hastily prepared UCC down the throats of all Indians before the 2019 election is at best needlessly alarmist and at worst governed by a polarising political agenda.
It would seem there is an attempt to deflect attention from the real issue: the morality of triple talaq in a contemporary society . In the Shah Bano case of 1985-86, the Supreme Court offended Muslim orthodoxy by sanctioning alimony payment to a divorced Muslim woman. At that time, the Rajiv Gandhi government caved in to political pressure and enacted a regressive law that overturned the judgment. Since then, the courts have corrected other iniquitous practices such as the denial of prayer rights to women at Hindu and Muslim shrines.These judgments, fortunately , have been respected.
If there is now a growing body of legal precedence upholding gender equity , it is possible that the triple talaq system may be struck down by the Supreme Court. On this limited matter -as well as on the right of Muslims to have multiple wives concurrently -there appears to be a loose consensus favouring reform. Moreover, in view of the grave perversion of triple talaq, there is a gender divide that implicitly challenges the right of theologians to speak on behalf of all Muslims and pronounce that Islam is in danger because women have been given marital rights. No wonder these custodians of faith are attempting to enlarge the battle and ensure community solidarity on an issue over which there is neither information nor consensus. Ironically , by waving the UCC flag quite mindlessly , the BJP’s over-zealous supporters are falling into the trap.
The coming months are certain to see much huffing and puffing over a UCC. No doubt some of the debate will be educative but there is also a danger that it could produce a contrived polarisation, and derail attempts to put an end to a practice that denies a large number of Indian women dignity and justice.

     agree people are facing difficulties and only good idea is not enough, effective implementation is also needed but it is not something which has halted peoples lives. i stay in metropolitan city and hv relatives from remote towns. they could exchanges/use  their 1000/500 notes in medicals/gas refill. how many notes comman man can have, 4/5, at max 10, he/she could easily get it exchanged in banks. it is not going to question for such small amount. whatever we earn, mostly our income goes into either buying home or donations in educational institutes sometimes hospitals bills which are sources of black money generation too. this move may not stop new generation of black money but is one step which can not be denied. if people really want good future for our children, they should support each small step taking our india to next good/clean level irrespective whether the man taking decision is of their supported political party or not. why only soldiers have to do their duty for our country, if with some suffering we can contribute something, will that be too difficult/impossible for us?...

Well, at least in the United States, something has exploded. After enduring the contempt and misogyny of the presidential campaign and seeing a chief practitioner elected, now the angry women are everywhere. They are calling out their abusers, gathering strength from each other. And the effect has been cataclysmic – studio bosses, editors, senators, chefs, men once thought to be masters of the universe, have been toppled. Time magazine declared 2017 the year of the “silence-breakers”.
This is happening far, far away from us. The women being heard now have a certain visibility and influence. They are guaranteed to be heard by the media and social media. This churn is yet to affect American women in low wage jobs, let alone challenge male impunity in other places.
But this is still a decisive moment; the harms of sexual harassment, and the scale of it, have been made abundantly clear to everyone. Some men have been indignant, confused, justificatory. Some claim that this will cramp all sexual encounters, as though women can’t tell the difference between a misguided pass and a threat, or that they’re vindictive enough to pass one off as the other. Other men are stunned to realise how the other half lives. For many women, reliving the experience of others is a fresh reminder of the ways we are subordinated – whether you’re a movie star in Beverly Hills or a domestic worker in Bengaluru, your sexual compliance can suddenly become key to keeping your job.
Sexual harassment is not about sex, it is about inequality at work, about erasing a woman’s worth, her mind, her competence, and reducing her to a body. It turns her labour, her striving, into a form of prostitution. And women who do climb high in their professional worlds are not exempt from these patterns of domination, even if they personally escaped them. And so, to blame Priyanka Chopra or Angelina Jolie for not speaking up sooner or more forcefully is to look away from the actual male perpetrators and the power structure that keeps women at their beck and call.
This is a moment of sharp recognition, but this will pass. We don’t know what will remain – blowback from an injured patriarchy, or an enduring transformation. India had its own reckoning a few years ago, after the Delhi gangrape – for a brief and vivid season, the question of women’s freedoms, their full rights, their autonomy, occupied public discourse. We saw the extent of sexual violence, the fear of it, the way it is reinforced by institutional hostility and popular culture, the way it cramps women’s autonomy. Laws on rape were amended, police reforms were promised.
But real change has not been easy or linear, as the later life of those very laws makes clear. Social norms remain stubborn, power has a male form. In some ways, our freedoms have retreated since, as conservative forces became ascendant in India. Their focus is on hierarchy, a natural order among humans that must be maintained.
From Banaras Hindu University to Hadiya, a woman’s right to study and work, love whom she wants and part on fair terms, her right to religious freedom, have all been under attack. Women’s rights are championed instrumentally and insincerely, as in the triple talaq cause. In this new-old worldview women can be possessed and prized, even ‘empowered’ from above, but not allowed to think and act as they want, or to defy their male protectors.
But even as that order presses down, it is being bucked more forcefully than ever. The women’s movement has been building strength, deepening and diversifying for decades. The quest for justice zigs and zags – Bhanwari Devi, the Rajasthani social worker who was gangraped, is still to get justice, but because of her, Indian women now have a law against sexual harassment in the workplace. The Nirbhaya moment may have gone, but the constituency it mobilised remains awake and vigilant. There is greater attention to the complexity of domination, how womanhood is one axis, caste, class and race are others – and how feminism must include them to be meaningful.
More women are speaking up, boosting each other’s signal, pushing back against the norms, giving precise words to male entitlement with terms like mansplaining, manterrupting, manels, etc. From ads to movies to comedy, this resistance is in our cultural bloodstream now. Many complain about this commodity feminism – the Dove commercial kind of girl-power that borrows the language but dilutes the threat to patriarchy. But it’s only one strand, among many others. There is feminist solidarity to be found and forged, more than ever. Women have voice, if not influence yet.
If 2017 was the year of the silence breakers, may the clamour continue. We don’t have to delude ourselves about the power and resilience of those we confront; the fact of inequality continues to distort everything in a woman’s life. There may be exceptions, but the rule remains. If the consequences of this year’s rage are to remain consequential, it’s on us.

     Sexual harassment must be stopped, agreed. However, many women are their own enemies first. Check out the roles women take up in films, TV, in the name of acting and only for money, mothers-in-law ill-treating their daughters-in-law, college girls making quick money you know how, extramarital affairs using many excuses, wanting to become fair-skinned, mistreating other women, and so on. They want to live out all their fantasies in public and still want men to honour them like goddesses. I am not referring here to the millions of wonderful Indian women who are positively contributing to society, in their own ways. Its these women who bring respect to womanhood....

The gathering of anti-BJP forces may well be the first step towards a nationwide mahagathbandhan of secular parties for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. And if such a grand coalition does fructify, it could prove a serious challenge for BJP. For, there are growing signs that the BJP dispensation has developed an authoritarian streak as exemplified by its championing of food laws and kid-glove approach to cow vigilantism. This provides an opportunity to anti-BJP parties to make an electoral comeback.
That said, for a grand opposition coalition to work there needs to be both chemistry and arithmetic. The latter looks good on paper, the former is more difficult. Take the case of Sharad Yadav. The senior JD(U) leader has been at loggerheads with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar ever since the latter broke the coalition with RJD and Congress to form a new ruling alliance with BJP. With JD(U) now pushing for Yadav’s removal from Rajya Sabha, it’s unclear what he brings to an anti-BJP formation.
Plus, the fact that BSP chief Mayawati stayed away from the RJD-sponsored rally shows that parties are still unsure about the project. Mayawati made it clear that she would only join a secular, anti-BJP coalition after a seat-sharing formula is worked out. In the same vein, Congress being represented by Ghulam Nabi Azad instead of party vice-president Rahul Gandhi shows that it too is testing the waters. After all, with RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and his family being charged with fresh cases of corruption, other political parties are wary of being tainted by association.
Besides, the opposition formation’s secular plank is also under a cloud. Mamata might be the most strident anti-BJP chief minister today, but her secular credentials are dubious. From banning Durga idol immersions on Muharram this year to a Trinamool minister openly criticising the recent Supreme Court triple talaq ban to Ishrat Jahan, petitioner in that case, facing social boycott in Kolkata, Mamata’s Bengal is anything but a paragon of secularism. Unless and until opposition parties iron out these inconsistencies a secular, anti-BJP platform will fail to make any political impact.

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav seems to have inherited the biting wit of his father, Lalu Prasad. Recently, he quipped: One day, Lord Ram started hiccupping. A concerned Sita asked why.
‘Elections are near and BJP leaders must be thinking of me,’ replied the Raghuvanshi. The joke sums up the anxiety in the BJP camp over the Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue in the run-up to elections. This anxiety is greater, as there’s the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj this year.
The historical divide between pro-Sangh and anti-Sangh Hindu seers witnessed parallel Dharam Sansads (religious conclaves), supplementing worries that matters would reach a flashpoint because one group always outruns the other.
The tone was already set by GoI seeking permission from the Supreme Court to return land to the VHP-controlled trust, with apprehensions of extreme reaction if the court accorded consent.
But the RSS-VHP-(VHP-backed) Dharam Sansad triad didn’t announce the expected date of construction. Instead, the seers backed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s call to work for the return of a ‘government having anational viewpoint committed to building Sri Ram Mandir’, even as his declaration was met with some opposition.
On the surface, this leaves PM Narendra Modi with the sole worry of diffusing the anti-VHP Dwarka Shankaracharya, Swaroopanand Saraswati’s plans to march to Ayodhya on February 21to lay the temple foundation stone violating court orders.
But BJP’s real concern is political. Will the ‘non-decision’ of the VHP-backed Dharam Sansad result in disillusioned Ram Mandir supporters voting against BJP? And can this be countered in the limited time available by the attestation that the country will spiral into chaos without Modi’s stewardship and minus the new ‘development plus achievements’ thrust unveiled in the interim budget? Yet, it remains inexplicable why a party that always reiterated its commitment to the construction of aRam Temple, didn’t initiate measures earlier to hasten the process.
Perhaps it’s because it’s not easy at all to circumvent the legal process and take a legislative route. While the pledge to enact a law may have yielded political returns when BJP was in Opposition, now it’s tasked with maintaining constitutional propriety. The Vajpayee government escaped by taking cover of not having a majority in Parliament.
The Modi government can’t afford that ‘luxury’. GoI passed several laws — including the Citizenship Amendment Bill and Triple Talaq Bill — that have got stuck in Rajya Sabha.
It knew their fate in the Upper House, but still pursued these Bills as it wanted to score a political point. It will be tough for it to explain if a section of Hindutva votaries now ask why GoI didn’t act similarly on a Ram Temple Bill.
Which brings us to the second reason for the Modi government to put the temple issue on the backburner. Perhaps this had to with the belief that its performance on other fronts would outweigh the modest progress on Ayodhya.
GoI’s pursuit of ‘muscular nationalism’ was thought to be adequately satisfying —if one goes by the argument that the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation wasn’t limited to a temple but was fundamentally about cultural nationalism.
Various programmes were also conducted in Ayodhya to shift ‘goalposts’, including the ‘Deepotsav’, where a record number of lamps were lit on Diwali eve, and the proposal to erect a gigantic statue of Ram. But as polls approached, BJP realised that these hadn’t satisfied the ‘Mandir waheen banaenge’ brigade. There was also apprehension about a shortfall in performance.
Thus the need to bolster the vikas narrative with developments on the temple front. The Centre’s application in the Supreme Court, and the way it has been presented within the BJP-Hindu fraternity, has to be seen in that light.
Both Modi and Bhagwat have consistently kept away from pressing the ‘polarisation’ button on the temple front. Both believe Hindutva can become the nation’s dominant ideology without allowing court orders to be violated.
But the politics of brinkmanship teases limits of peace. The dangers of criticising the judiciary while telling everyone to keep the law, as Bhagwat has been doing, could well be breached by hotheads in a hotly contested election season.

     One cannot speak for our revered Lord Ram, but few Indians are hiccuping, one way or another, over the prospects of construction of a temple in his honour.

Hope. It’s a powerful emotion that can efficaciously influence human behaviour. It is almost fervently like faith, a confident trust in someone or something. It makes us aspire for more – like in Bollywood movies – for a better, even if implausible, future and drives us to dream and act. Hope is a fabulous marketable commodity. It’s not a buzzword; it’s a real feeling of possibilities. People look towards actors and politicians for hope, just as also countries, social groups, families, and religion.
Hope is not strategy is what experts say. But hope as a positioning strategy works eternally and is a trillion-dollar industry. Take for instance the key positioning of most products and services: Soap, shampoo, cosmetics, business schools, lifestyle products, and of course, politicians. Remember the promises of “roti-kapda-makaan”, “bijli-paani” and of course the “achhe din” and nationalism? Our research into the manifestos of political parties exposes that many items of the ‘70s campaigns continue to lure us even today.
Most of the leaders, once elected, simply forget or don’t care about fulfilling that hope. Prime Minister Modi, however, has been brilliant in mesmerising, if not hypnotising, us with hope even after a disastrous five-year term. Pro-government media, with the help of cross-holdings in competing media houses by a willing tycoon, still say over 68% of people brim with optimism despite worsening or no change in their quality of life. Even a pandemic has been turned into an opportunity.
Modi came in at a time when our political system was ensnared in controversies, corruption, leadership deficit, nepotism, primogeniture, and exploitation of the poor. He was like a fresh breeze in contrast to a media-shy, media-incompetent, and back-foot-driving UPA. He kindled hopes of millions with possibilities because he was projected as someone from the lower middle class (“chaiwallah”). The brilliant PR and social media blitzkrieg did the rest to set the campfires of hope.
Arguably, Modi panache with the “corruption-free and congress-mukth bharat” mantra, and the promise of Rs 15L in every Indian’s pocket worked like magic. And how did he follow this through for the next term mandate? Safety and security for India and the Pulwama attack in 2019 February came astonishingly handy for using that as the main plank for the election campaign. A new hope of strength and patriotism that gagged the opposition totally.
Can Modi become a custodian of hope and craft it in a way that makes things possible for us, and impossible for the opposition to replicate? He can do so by taking two dominant strategic tracks: One, by making hitherto perceived impossibilities into possibilities, which he seems to be attempting well, and two, by aggrandising the craving for more.
Regarding the first track, some people draw parallels with Kennedy and his moon mission when Modi initiated demonetisation as a route to rout out corruption. Kennedy avoided skepticism by being eloquent on his mission and following through with meticulous execution in the cold war era to retain America’s confidence. Modi launched DeMo for a seemingly impossible mission, with lousy execution. Like Kennedy, Modi found connection with the masses for whom the idea of the rich suffering was a brand new hope, even if self-suffering endured. And the reports of CEOs attributing poor results to DeMo helped reinforce that hope. That the opposition failed in busting the myth of the Rich-Misery, aggravated their defeat in UP. Modi went further to achieve another impossibility: Abolition of beacons, the VIP symbolism. The strategic framework for managing hope: Show the overall possibilities first, followed by the possibilities in the individual, and finally those in the process. That it all failed to deliver the “achhe din” is another issue altogether but then opposition had failed to project that to the vote banks.
As for the second track on increasing the craving for a causatum, Modi needs to work harder and it can be tricky. And that is showing in this term as the economy is weakening, not enough knowledgeable people surrounding him and inability to execute anything is obvious. He will have to try increasing the perceived importance of the outcome and by increasing the degree of its association with an acclamatory goal. It is worth looking at cow vigilantism, triple talaq, Ram Temple, or the ongoing CAA-NRC controversy through this lens. It may be to divert attention from the core issues (growing unemployment, deteriorating economy, escalating cost of living, troubling NPAs, etc) so that the craving gets boosted.
The latest was witnessed when he addressed the nation for “janata curfew” and clapping of hands at 5pm on March 22. What followed was a social media campaign, explaining why he chose this auspicious time to ward off the virus, connecting moon and stars! This was followed by two subsequent prime time TV addresses for clapping hands in European style from balconies and diya-lighting tamasha to energise the lethargic middle class. When the “walking class” migrant issue exploded on humanity, he brought out a 20 lakh crore loan hungama which at best can only postpone the mass suicides of the poor to a later date but the publicity machinery of the government went all out to convince the masses it was a “wow” package from Modi. The Covid-19 has become the perfect storm for the government for all the economic issues ailing the country for the last 4 years and the media has already hailed him as the messiah saving India from the pandemic. Even the pandemic has become an opportunity to build hope further and his followers are now proposing to get him no less than a Nobel Prize for Peace!
By following the two tracks Modi will continue to retain the blind loyalty created via hope, and people will forgive below-expected performance. Several studies across the globe justify optimism: People will ignore or rationalise poor performance when hopes are high in a brand, person, or outcome. More importantly, they need less persuasion then to be convinced further. Herein lies the Catch-22 for the opposition: Damned if they do, damned if they don’t.
The opposition needs a better strategy to steal (or dismantle) the hope platform. Secular? Nah. Anti-Modi rhetoric? Nope. The rising unemployment and poverty? Perhaps for diluting the hope platform, but not to bring in new hopes. They could have started off a “satygraha” for the resignation of Modi for failing to protect the migrants, and for causing more deaths than any act of terrorism has caused so far. Nor did they demand the resignation of Railway Minister for lying under oath that no migrant lost life while in the trains.
Instead of applying Newton’s third law to every NDA action, they should focus on the core ones driving optimism and demolish each. Without bringing disdain they will not be able to build new hopes. Data-fudging issue is something that will find currency with business community. A Grand Alliance is unlikely to bring any new hope, as it is just a coalition of the same perceived-corrupt, mother-father-son-daughter set. Do they have a clear vision that enhances hope? None was visible in the total silence on cow issues, minority/dalit hunting, CAA and so on. Worst, the party that could really lead from the front has shown its utter poverty in leadership by sticking to the mother-son-daughter drama.
The Congress should embrace a disruptive strategy that will torpedo Modi’s hope strategy. Perhaps focusing on the more progressive deep similarities between the majority and minority instead of disagreeing with the BJP’s focus on superficial differences between the religions may be a good narrative. Look no further than the Kerala society for proof of this pudding. The Congress is fast missing a great opportunity to mobilise the migrants and the poor for a mass movement that can totally destruct the hope platform given the utter disaster in the time of pandemic.
Three key traits are hallmarks of people who can instill hope in others: Caring deeply about, and working for, people; having the focus on what is possible and matters most to people; and speaking from the heart, like perhaps Kejriwal. Perhaps Congress should lead the disruption agenda by letting someone with the above traits to lead the party. Clearly a family member will not be able to occupy the position given the framework of hope. Our “Pulse” research indicates that people prefer a leader who they can identify as someone like them to lead the Congress, and if they do that with internal bottom-up democratic elections, BJP will have no narrative against them, which hitherto has been solely focussed on the dynasty. “The-Nehru-legacy-shall-be-the-party-and-not-the-family” is a good narrative for Congress, and is certain to enhance the hopes of the party workers, if not of the entire nation.

     Hubler Ross model of griefing is a good read for everyone including the author. Hope is what great leaders create, whether it lasts, converts into expected results is a function system and everyone plus the leader. Author suggests good points to opposition, but fails to give credit to what Modi was, is and somethings he had done well. Criticisms should be with data on all bad things Modi is debited with, as long as hopefuls are more than critics , the juggernaut rolls on.....  Read More

In a brilliant move of political chess, the BJP-led NDA government has caught the self-styled liberal opposition in a fork by getting the bill banning and criminalising triple talaq passed in the Rajya Sabha and made into a law.
Even as the banning of triple talaq reassures BJP’s core saffron constituency that the lotus party is putting paid to the `politics of appeasement’, in the name of gender equity it also wins the support of women, of all communities who will see it as another step towards greater feminine empowerment.
At the same time the so-called liberal establishment has been caught flatfooted and finds itself between the devil and the deep blue sea.
If liberals challenge the triple talaq law in the name of freedom of religious practice they are seen as opposing gender justice. If they back the new legislation they will have to do an ideological about-turn on the `secular’ stand they had earlier taken on the issue that the state should not interfere in the social customs of minority communities.
The liberal dilemma will become even more problematic when the government makes the next logical move and presses for a common civil code.
If the state can – as it has done – enact laws prohibiting polygamy and dowry demands within the majority community, why can it not similarly legislate against gender-biased customs in all communities through the adoption of the uniform civil code applicable to all, regardless of religion?
If liberals oppose such a code which seeks equality of all faiths, their self-professed secularism will be exposed as shambolic posturing.

On the other hand, if they endorse a uniform code it will mean a betrayal of a core tenet of their political philosophy.
In other words, they will be damned if they do, and damned if they don’t. Or, to use chess terminology, they’re well and truly forked.

While all agree that the practice is not a valid form according to Islamic law, there is very little debate on the creation of an alternative to it.
Islamic law is modern in its approach to the institution of marriage as theoretically it stresses the autonomy and free consent of parties. The concept of divorce in Islamic law is akin to irretrievable breakdown where spouses do not have to find fault with each other in order to end their marriage. But its practice in India is highly discriminatory, giving the man the right to divorce his wife at will in the form of triple talaq or Talaq ul Biddat, even though there are other forms divorces. Such a talaq when stated thrice in the presence of two witnesses becomes a valid divorce. The wife’s consent is irrelevant as even her presence is not required. If the wife wants to end the marriage and the husband refuses to give a talaq, she has to initiate proceedings under the Dissolution of the Muslim Marriages Act.
Apart from the trauma and economic devastation that triple talaq causes to women, such divorces also have a complex legal impact. In 1985, the Supreme Court in the Shah Bano case held that section 125 of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) that provides for maintenance to wives including divorced wives was applicable to Muslims and did not violate Islamic law. The argument put forth by the husband in the case was that directing a man to maintain his divorced wife was prohibited under Islamic law. In order to negate the impact of this judgment, the Centre enacted The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. Under this Act a husband is liable to maintain his divorced wife for a period of three months in a reasonable and fair manner, after which she is entitled to seek maintenance from her heirs or if there is no one to maintain her, from the Wakf Boards. The husband is completely absolved from his obligation to provide for his wife.
In order to subvert the obligation to pay maintenance to their wives, there are many instances when men pronounce triple talaq as soon as the wife files for maintenance. A cheque is often sent for a pittance claiming that this is the maintenance for three months. It is then argued in court that as talaq has been pronounced the wife cannot claim maintenance, making it a fait accompli. Some women challenge the validity of such talaqs by filing declaratory suits on the basis of a judgment of the Supreme Court in Shamim Ara vs State of UP (case) which held that evidence has to be adduced to show that a talaq has been pronounced. But these are few and far between.
Muslim women are also confronted with the onerous task of having to file multiple proceedings under different statutes in different courts unlike women of other religious communities. A married woman can initiate a maintenance case under Section 125 CrPC. If she is divorced she has to initiate proceedings under The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. If she seeks custody of her children she has to initiate her case under the Guardian and Wards Act. And if she wants to dissolve her marriage, she has to initiate proceedings under the Dissolution of the Muslim Marriage Act. In areas where there are no family courts these proceedings have to be filed in different courts making her run from pillar to post.
Access to justice in the best of times is difficult for women who are discriminated against in the system. In the case of Muslim women there is double discrimination. The only legislation under which they can seek some recourse in a consolidated form is the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
Prohibiting triple talaq can only be the beginning for further reforms. Many countries governed by Islamic law have legislations that prohibit the same. In Pakistan and Bangladesh divorces are governed by the Family Law Ordinance that does not recognise triple talaq and provides for mediation and reconciliation. In India too one way of approaching this would be to amend the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939, making it gender neutral and having provisions in it for interim maintenance, alimony, custody of children and other rights incidental to marriage taking the principles of Islamic law.

Founder of the Majlis centre, Agnes recently delivered the Durgabai Deshmukh lecture on Hindu code, organised by the Council for Social Development. Speaking with Akshaya Mukul, Agnes discussed rising attacks on Dalits and women, why she thinks legal reforms alone don’t work for gender equity, why she supports dowry – and not a legal ban on triple talaq:  
What do you have to say about a BJP leader’s recent attack on Mayawati?
Well, the Dalit issue is rising in this country – no other issue will bring down the BJP government more than the Dalit issue.
Gujarat is burning, they are attacking Mayawati in UP and in Mumbai, a young boy gets killed for falling in love with a girl of a slightly higher caste.
The more BJP does this, the more it will alienate people and lose power.
Speaking of relationships, has codified Hindu law changed gender relationships? 
Legal reform happens in a context. In the case of Hindu codified law, the plank was reform for Hindus. In 1950, in Article 44 of the constitution called for a uniform civil code and Article 14 talked of no discrimination – five years later, it passed a law for Hindus.
Isn’t it a violation? Why only for Hindus?
It happened because upper-caste Hindu women were lagging far behind Muslim, Christians and even backward Hindu women – upper-caste Hindu women had no right to property as daughters.
The second reason was changing gender relations and empowering Hindu women.
But there was a political agenda. Partition had happened – the government knew that if it rakes up anything else, the country itself would not survive. So, Muslims and Christians were left and the government thought personal law for Hindus has to be done immediately.
To do this, they cast the net of legal Hinduism wide and said anyone born in India who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew is a Hindu. The state got the right to legislate on a large number of people.
What is the essential ceremony of a valid marriage? Kanyadaan and saptapadi. What is kanyadan? It is giving away. Once she is given away, a daughter by tradition is no longer a member of the family. She has no right to come back.
My question is – has codified Hindu law changed gender relationships to the extent that a uniform civil code can be built on its edifice?
So, you argue time is not right for a uniform civil code?
Yes. Let me give you examples of child marriage that Hindu society is not supposed to have. Latest statistics shows 12 million children under 10 are married – 84% are Hindus.
So, can we say that Hindu law and this particular legislation, banning child marriage, changed gender relationships? Muslims have no law – but hardly any child marriage is taking place.
Now let’s take dowry. Do you think dowry has stopped because you brought in laws? Let me give you a shocker – i am not against dowry at all because in Hindu society, a daughter gets nothing after the father dies. Even where something is given to a daughter, it’s given to her in-laws or the son-in-law.
But what about cases where there is persistent demand and ensuing violence?
Why do people marry their daughter into such a family?
More and more women are dying, getting burnt or killed because parents are refusing to keep their daughters. Shouldn’t laws be changed for that?  With what arrogance are we saying that Hindu law is reformed – and we have to extend the reform?
But you’re also opposing a ban on triple talaq. Why?
Supreme Court invalidated instant triple talaq in 2002 in the Shamim Ara case. In Danial Latifi vs Union of India case on Muslim Women’s Act, the SC heard nearly 30 petitions. NCW and many women organisations intervened. The other half of petitioners were husbands in appeal.
If the law was in favour of husbands, why did they come to the SC?
Many courts were giving lump sum maintenance to women as per this law. The SC upheld the validity of this.
But courts cannot ban anything – the legislature can. If you ban talaq which a community does not want, you make the community a martyr – you’ll make the Muslim Board a martyr.

At a time when Supreme Court has sought central government’s response on a petition seeking universal entry of women into mosques comes journalist Ziya Us Salam’s book Women in Masjid: A Quest for Justice. He tells Jiby J Kattakayam why there is no reason to keep women out:
Does the Quran sanction the entry of women into mosques? 
Quran does not discriminate against women. Wherever Quran talks of establishing prayer, it addresses both men and women. At 59 places, Quran asks men and women to establish prayer. The Prophet instructed men not to stop women from going to mosques. Quran says prayer can be offered in private but it can only be established (and perfected) in a group, in a congregation. The situation at the ground level in our country is totally different.
Mosques have been reduced to a male monopoly. It stems both from lack of understanding of Islamic principles and well-entrenched patriarchal forces. Indian men forget that when the azaan (prayer call) is pronounced from mosque, both men and women are invited. How can you turn down somebody after extending an invitation? And when it comes to Hadiths (record of Prophet’s sayings and traditions), they pick and choose according to their convenience. The men remind women that the best prayer for them is offered at home, but forget that the Prophet never stopped women from going to a mosque for prayers.
Is there a problem of various Islamic commentaries contradicting each other?
No, there is no contradiction. No commentator of Quran, be it Abul Ala Mawdudi, or Israr Ahmed, or contemporaries like Yasir Qadhi and Nouman Ali Khan have ever asked women not to go to a mosque. In fact, in Delhi, at the headquarters of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, founded by Mawdudi, there is a separate section for women. Every Friday, one can see women going for prayer there.
The problem lies with the local maulanas who understand little of Quran. In fact, most Indian Muslims do not understand Quran in Arabic and do not read the translation. In Kerala where more Muslims know Arabic than in north India things are different. Hundreds of mosques make provision for women in Kerala.
In India, how do you trace the historical trajectory of Muslim women’s rights?
The condition of Muslim women was much better in medieval India. During the Sultanate age there were hundreds of madrassas where girls were educated. Even many slave girls had become Quran haafiz – one who had memorised Quran.
In the Mughal age we have evidence of women building madrassas and mosques. At the time of nikaah, many women put terms and conditions in the nikaahnama. Like the marriage won’t end via instant triple talaq and the husband won’t marry again without her permission. In post-Independence India, religion has become a monopoly of men. There are much fewer Islamic seminaries for women. Triple talaq came to be accepted and women began to be kept out of mosques. No longer do we see women dictating nikaahnamas.
What motivated you to write this book? 
I saw this huge dichotomy between what Islam preached and what many of our maulanas and other men practised. For instance, when a Muslim man goes for Hajj or Umrah, he takes his wife, mother or daughter along. They perform the pilgrimage together in Mecca. They go to the Prophet’s mosque in Medina where both men and women have clearly marked halls. They worship together at the same time. But when the same man comes back to India, he leaves his wife and mother behind at home when he goes to a local mosque for prayer. What is applicable to mosques across West Asia is applicable here too.
You argue that Islam was a reformation of Arab society. 
When the Prophet came, the girl child used to be buried alive in the Arab world, much like we have female infanticide in the form of termination of the female child in the womb. Similarly, men used to have endless number of wives and divorces at that time. Islam put an end to it by limiting the number of divorces to three, the third one being irrevocable. It also put the ceiling at four wives with clear terms and conditions. It does not mean that every man has to have four wives. The permission granted came with a rider: be equitable and just between them. That is a tall order for any man.
What prevents Muslim community from making more space for women?
The problem is more structural. The mosques are designed by men, for men. When mosques are built, women do not figure in the scheme of things. At some places, where women do come for prayers, the section is well removed from the main hall, often with faulty audio system. It has zero provision for ablution, etc. Fortunately, women, who had been indoctrinated for long, are beginning to speak up. We have the case of woman scholar Farhat Hashmi giving her own independent commentary of Quran. Initially, she was criticised by maulanas. As she gained her voice, they fell silent!
Is a court judgment allowing women entry to mosques, like Sabarimala, desirable?
I will not go into the argument of whether it is desirable. The fact is women have not been denied by religion. Who are men to deny? If the court takes a decision based on Quran, the women will be on a sound footing. If it takes it with the Constitution in mind, they will still be well placed. I do not foresee any stalemate.

"1616953221-103","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/10/?s=triple+talaq","Understanding Muslim women and men","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Arrackistan/understanding-muslim-women-and-men/","Understanding Muslim women and men","April 28, 2018, 11:56 AM  IST","John Cheeran","Does Islam treat women fairly when it comes to marriage and divorce? Islam does unequivocally, but men do not. The Supreme Court on August 22, 2017, in theory, brought relief to harried Muslim women by declaring instant triple talaq invalid through a 3-2 split verdict. Justice Kurian Joseph, whose vote proved decisive in setting aside instant triple talaq, came up with a memorable statement: “What is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well…Merely because a practice has continued for long, that by itself cannot make it valid if it has been expressly declared to be impermissible.” The seven Muslim women petitioning the SC had wanted multiple pronouncements of divorce at the same time declared illegal in consonance with the laws in almost 20 Muslim countries.
Many—mainly non-Muslims in India—argue that this judgment is not enough and believe the time is ripe for hammering out a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. What is important in this context that different religions have different laws for marriage and, consequently, for divorce.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-102724"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Talaq.jpg"" alt="""" width=""326"" height=""501"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Talaq.jpg 326w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Talaq-195x300.jpg 195w"" sizes=""(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px"">
For example, in Christianity, theology does not permit a divorce and a divorce is granted only by a civil court. There, too, a Christian couple has to wait for a mandatory two-year waiting period to get separated even with mutual consent. In that sense, Islam is a truly liberating religion for in any type of divorce, the Muslim man and woman have to wait only a maximum of 90 days to go their own separate ways.
The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) married 11 times and he definitely knew about the difficulties of marriage, unlike Jesus Christ. So Islam makes it easy for men and women to go their own ways but how strange then is the practice of Muslim men to get their divorce in three seconds! Of course, they are in a hurry.
But the important point is that there are enough defenders for instant triple talaq, (crucially, Shia Muslims in India are not following instant triple talaq) including the then Chief Justice of India J S Kehar, who argued in August 2017 that instant triple talaq is a practice in vogue for 1400 years although the Quran does not sanctify it.
In this context, senior journalist Ziya Us Salam has done a great job in clearing the muddy waters around the Muslim marriage and divorce in his cogently reasoned Till Talaq Do Us Part: Understanding Talaq, Triple Talaq and Khula (Published by Penguin Books, Pages 218, Rs 399). This is a must-read for our times.
Apart from giving the low down on the varieties of divorces in Islam, including that of Khula which empowers a Muslim woman to divorce her husband without assigning any reason whatsoever, Ziya Us Salam makes a few very significant points in Till Talaq Do Us Part. He says the Supreme Court judgment is unlikely to have any impact at the ground level. “The Supreme Court judges pronounced their decision in New Delhi, but in the small towns and villages of India, social norms are often paramount, all law subservient to them. That explains why both dowry and the caste system continue to prevail despite strictures against both.”
And Ziya also draws our attention to the fact that five out of the seven petitioners did not get their key demand. The SC had not said a direct word about the marital status of them, and that despite the court ruling, it might not be easy to set aside instant talaq in real life.
All laws relating to marriage and divorce in every religion are there to ensure justice for women from the caprices of men. But unless the woman becomes economically independent these laws would hardly serve her any purpose. The key remains that Muslim women, especially Indian Muslim women, should have the tools to negotiate modernity, by getting educated, and, thereby, earning a degree in independent thought. Without that Khula and other egalitarian provisions in the Quran will not save them.
Ziya highlights the challenges that Muslim women in India are facing by pointing out that they are excluded from most of the mosques in the country despite the Prophet making provisions for their prayers. Ziya says mosques are reduced to a male domain. “Women, if they do enter, are considered aliens, another species, who have perchance entered the wrong place,” writes Ziya. He says maulanas are ill-equipped to interpret and explain the Quran and tell the followers what is right and wrong.
One cannot agree more when Ziya says that until the ignorance of women’s rights is dispelled, the Supreme Court order or even a legislation will be adhered to more as the exception than the norm. Like the ban on the caste system, like the prohibition on dowry, the latest court order and a piece of legislation on setting aside instant triple talaq and imprisoning the husband will need social support for it to be effective. Yes, Islam is in danger in India but it largely stems from within and the way forward, as Ziya says, lies in a better understanding of the Quran.

"1616953579-184","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=triple+talaq","India has changed forever!","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/india-as-i-see-it-a-soldiers-view/india-has-changed-forever/","India has changed forever!","January 13, 2020, 3:22 PM  IST","Col N Bhatnagar","After having witnessed these recent agitations, one thing that stands out very clearly is that the Congress and so called secular parties and some sections of media have a big role to play in spoiling the communal situation in India. I have for the ease of understanding have addressed them as a Gang, instead of taking their names, because they all are hand in glove and second they are now known to all.
Till a few years back, me and many of my friends, both from armed forces as well as in other professions never liked to associate ourselves with Hindutva forces including BJP/Jansangha. We always believed that they had a tendency to look at everything from the Prism of Religion and so always equated them with the Maulanas. Most of us never voted for them as well.
I think most of the Indians also looked at them suspiciously. As a result, the erstwhile Jansangha and its new Awataar i.e BJP for many many years could barely win 5- 10 seats in Lok sabha Elections. There was a time when they had just One elected member in Lok sabha.
We must acknowledge and appreciate that If Hindus and Sikhs despite having witnessed all the blood bath, violence and partition of their Land in 1947 always stood by Congress and did not support Jansangha for all these years, it is a testimony of their firm belief on SECUALRISM and their TOLERANCE .
Therefore, it would not be wrong to state that if India has stuck to secularism and voted for parties that supported Secularism the credit must go to the Hindus and Sikhs who despite having faced the consequences of the partition continued to display the resolve and strength of character.
However, as things have turned out in last few decades the same Tolerant and Secular Hindu has now been shaken to the core. His belief in secularism as being practiced in India now lies shattered. We now call this gang as Pseudo Secularists who speak selectively.
The same Tolerant Hindu now feels cheated. The recent agitations against CAA, Article 370, NRC etc has strengthened our conviction that come what may we will not support this kind of pseudo secularism in the country. These are the important issues related to our safety and security and hence No one is now willing to buy the story of these Pseudo secularists that it’s a Pan India protest and that Govt is scared of students protest and so on.
The nation today is rather questioning those, who started the India Intolerant campaign and those who returned their awards and those who stood in support of Tukde Tukde Gang ;
Where were they when Shah Bano was denied justice?
Why did they not speak up when 54 people were burnt to death in a train and they rather created a false narrative that they died because of the fire from within the bogie?
Why did they not open their gob, returned their awards and called Muslims as Intolerant when Kashmiri Pundits were compelled to leave their homes?
Why did they remain silent when Sikhs were gruesomely killed and entire system succumbed to pressure of the ruling party?
Why did n’t they speak up for the rights of muslim women when the provision of Triple talaq was being misused by Muslim men?
Why don’t they speak when young girls in Pakistan (It is said almost One thousand) every year are kidnapped and converted into Islam, that too when the Judges of Pakistan have raised this query?
The people now want to know as to Why does this gang opens its mouth selectively? The moment Modiji came to power they started speaking that India has become Intolerant and started returning their awards. They did not appreciate that It was because of our tolerance and secular beliefs that despite having faced the consequences of violence of 1947 and partition of our Land that we continued to support Congress and shun Jansangha/BJP for so many years.
The duplicity of this Gang and its eco system is exposed now. They can go anywhere in the world, get their articles published in international newspapers, conduct as many seminars and Dharnas abroad, using their connections, it is not going to make any difference now.
No one in India is scared of JNU, Jamia and AMU protests. If few can choose to come out on streets and burn public property it does not mean that they are in majority. The silent majority is sitting in homes having firm belief in Modiji, and no amount of such orchestrated agitations by Maulanas and students of JNU/AMU/Jamia roping in few actors is going to change their view.
More than Modiji it is this gang which is responsible for this change. This silent majority has proved its strength in elections and will do so again if this gang does not change its attitude. The more you call us Intolerant, the more determined we will become.
And if some maulanas believe that this gang will help them out and bring back pseudo seculars in power, then my considered view is, this is not going to work anymore and they would be doing great disservice to their community.
Its high time we start calling a spade as spade and believing in true secularism. If lynching of muslims is wrong then violent protests against CAA is also wrong, if stopping internet services in Kashmir indefinitely is wrong then supporting Jehadi and fundamentalists opposing repealing of article 370 is also wrong. If denying the status of a State to Jammu and Kashmir is wrong then suppressing the rightful demands of people of Ladakh and Jammu/Udhampur region is also wrong, if violation of human rights of Muslims is wrong then denying the same to Kashmiri pundits and those left behind in 1947 is also morally wrong.
The Gang needs to realize that India has now changed forever. The majority community can now no more be hood winked on the pretext that our unity and integrity is under threat and so on.

Indian conscience, long in slumber before the ‘dare-devils’ took over in 2014, limbered up to get over the inertia after some creditable firsts achieved in NaMo Edition-1. With the 2019 Lok Sabha elections done and dusted and a landslide win reaffirming the faith of the people, came Edition-2 … and the Nation went off the blocks.
Myths shattered, historical wrongs corrected, seemingly impossible achieved – the record-breaking dream run in the parliament leaves Bharatvarsh well poised to be catapulted to the next orbit. All seemingly in spectacular synch with the progress of Chandrayaan-2, well and truly on course to the moon.
Most encouraging is the good number of such major bills passed, the very thought of introducing which, gave cold feet to erstwhile governments. A daring feat it indeed has been, egged by the confidence drawn out of the faith the people placed in the present dispensation a second time. These are the kind of bills, whose passage through the parliament is bound to have the greatest impact on the pace of the nation’s progress and positive changes for the benefit of its citizenry.
To put things in perspective, out of a staggering 38 bills introduced in this session, an astounding 28 have been passed by both the houses. What needs to be borne in mind is the wide-ranging aspects these pertain to – be it social, security, infrastructure, law & order or industry, they encompass all. To name a few – Regulation of surrogacy, Protection of transgenders, Occupational safety, Interstate water disputes, Unlawful Activities Prevention, NIA amendment, National Medical Commission, Motor Vehicles Act amendment, Triple Talaq, Repealing of Article370 and Geographical reorganisation of J&K.
What’s been most reassuring about this phenomenal pace of work is the realisation that the present leadership is alive to the multiple challenges the nation faces. More importantly, ready to take them on with the dint of sheer hard work and sincerity of purpose. It’s not been the first time though when NaMo Inc. has taken hard decisions risking ‘popularity’ as was perceived through the thick lense of conventional Indian vote bank politics a few years back. It has been a breakaway in every sense of the word from the old school of politicking.
Hunting in pair, the refreshingly intelligent and pleasantly tactful new brand of leadership that the Lions of Gujarat offer to the Nation has been truly formidable and coming of age. Most spectacular has been the meticulous planning and copybook coordination that the eventual implementation highlights. The detailed study and elaborate planning with attention to the last detail that would have gone in is evident in the flawless execution of the will. ‘Political Will’ or more appropriately the lack of it, had long been the bane of the nation. The intent now on most matters is crystal clear, with most heartening being the realisation that finally it is ‘politicians for the nation’ and not the other way round, as it used to be.
The tide clearly has turned. A hapless western neighbour stands clueless with its much-heralded nuclear bogey exposed and missiles named after infamous plunderers of the yesteryears having run out of steam long before proving to be of any consequence. The myth of the mighty Paki Army as ingrained into the minds of its people over the generations appears to finally be crumbling. A rogue nation, committed to bleed India has well and truly been shown it’s a place. On the brink of bankruptcy and having been given a befitting account of the power that the new, resurgent India wields, the terror haven is waiting to implode. Kashmir already on a sure path to integration with the Union of India in the true sense now, is bound to eventually pull the plug on the sinister fallacies hitherto propagated, sooner than later.
As Bharatvarsh revels in the positive changes ringing-in at a pace like nowhere else on the planet, one must be mindful of the fact that it’s the leadership that – decides the course, steers the execution and even takes the pounding for slip-ups if any. Leaders with the courage of conviction and guts to take the onus have been rare on our revered land of plenty, particularly after the colonial masters left.
The unprecedented turn of events in the recent months culminating in the complete integration of Kashmir into the Indian Union calls for a special celebration this Independence Day. Let the Tricolor that adorns every nook and corner of the Union shine bright this time as the jewel in the Crown of India that is Kashmir.

Include polygamy and Nikah Halala in this Bill too","December 11, 2017, 1:25 PM  IST","Lalita Nijhawan","On November 24, a 32-year-old woman was allegedly divorced by her husband via phone call. They were married for 10 years and have children. Her husband uttered “talaq” thrice on the phone as the woman wasn’t able to meet his extortionist demands for dowry.
“There were 177 reported cases of triple talaq before the Supreme Court verdict. Even after the verdict, 67 cases of instant talaq were reported. The majority of such cases were in Uttar Pradesh,” said a senior government official.
On August 22, the Supreme Court declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional. The court’s ruling was that instant triple talaq is “violative of the fundamental right under Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution of India”.
The verdict added that Muslim Personal Law (Sharia) Application Act, 1937, when it comes to the matter of triple talaq, must be removed. After the landmark judgment, it was up to Parliament to enact the legislation regarding Muslim marriages and divorce, which is to be implemented within six months of the Supreme Court ruling.
The government plans to introduce legislation aimed at outlawing the controversial Muslim practice of instant triple talaq in the coming winter session of Parliament. “The draft has been sent to all the state heads, and their recommendations and comments have been sought on the draft. Once that is done, further steps will be taken to table the Bill,” a Home ministry official had said. It has been reported that state heads had been given three months to give their suggestions and consent.
The plan is to bring a bill that will ban instant triple talaq, create a non-bailable punishment, and a three-year imprisonment sentence against the husband. The bill may also grant the wife maintenance and custody of her minor children by moving the court. The bill will make instant talaq through any form (verbal, writing, electronic etc) illegal and void. Any aggrieved Muslim woman would be entitled to approach a magistrate court to seek redressal.
A senior BJP leader said, “the issue of triple talaq has become a social concern because women have started coming out against it. The practice is now being opposed by women who are financially and socially vulnerable.” When instant triple talaq happens, a victim has no option but to approach the police for justice. “Even police are helpless as no action can be taken against the husband in the absence of punitive provisions in the law. The step taken by the government is a positive message and legislation will go a long way in deterring Muslim husbands from divorcing their wives. Legislation will also empower women who find themselves helpless against the use of the practice,” the BJP leader had said.
The best solution to remove all hardships faced by women would be to apply Uniform Civil Code nationally and remove Personal Laws. When it comes to polygamy, instant triple talaq and nikah halala in Sharia Law, they all are a violation of the rights and integrity of a woman. To follow a UCC which guides each individual under the same purview of the law with equality not only of religion, but also of gender, is the aim of our constitution and our judicial system. Till when will our Muslim sisters fight these archaic practices?

Though the problem of Personal Laws isn’t limited to Muslim women, it also extends to other factional divisions.
In 1991, Goolrukh Gupta, who was named Goolrukh Contractor before her marriage, was married in South Gujarat to a Hindu Man. Originally from the Zoroastrian faith, she held to her religion and continued her practices even after marriage. After her father’s death she was denied entry to the Tower of Silence in Mumbai, even though her father’s last rights were performed there.  She approached Gujarat High Court against this discrimination.
The Gujarat High Court stated in 2012 that due to the Special Marriage Act, (applicable where two individuals from different faiths marry), her religion had changed to that of her husband. She is no longer a Parsi and is now a Hindu. She took the case to the Supreme Court against the Gujarat High Court’s judgment which claimed that Ms Goolrukh Gupta ceased to be a Parsi after her marriage to a Hindu. Chief Justice Misra stated that a woman is not mortgaged to her husband after marriage, her individual identity as well as religious identity are maintained under the Special Marriage Act.
The Chief Justice further said that only a woman can choose to follow or curtail her religious identity, she has that freedom of choice under the Special Marriage Act. If only such freedom of choice, identity and equality were granted to members of all religions and faith.

     Agree with you 100% . UCC , with equality before law in society for person of any religion, caste creed or gender is the need of the hour. But it is not so easy. The MCPs of Hindu society will come together with Mulla's and Padris of other community ( all Orthodox of all religions will unite ) against it. Politicians will oppose . Modi will find it difficult to push it , as he is finding to make GST acceptable to  traders ( who were avoiding or stealing tax, IT as well as indirect taxes,) . But yes I agree Muslim women are more at receiving end of injustice from their own society due to Polygamy and triple Talaq. They can be and are made totally submissive to their male counter parts....  Read More

It also has the potential to make the economy wilt and seriously impact economic growth.
In May 2014, BJP garnered an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. BJP claimed that its policies were endorsed by the electorate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political muscle flexing catered to the emotive Hindu mind. He made people believe he would avenge historic wrongs to resurrect Hindu pride.
The silent majority was targeted by carefully crafted projects of RSS, Bajrang Dal and fringe elements, seeking to change the social fabric of India. ‘Ghar wapsi’ got a huge response and the accompanying acts of violence were regarded as necessary non-actionable consequences. ‘Love jihad’ made front page news. The ruling establishment watched in silence. The mindset of the ordinary Hindu was slowly getting alienated from the culture of accommodation. The spectre of two people falling in love was portrayed as a sinister act of proselytisation: weaning away innocent young girls.
When false narratives in the supply of power to ‘shamshan ghats’ and ‘kabristans’ are pushed for political gain and the silent majority responds, then we know that the seeds of divisive politics have taken root. This build-up in the Modi 1.0 years set the agenda for 2019. When falsehoods like feeding biryani to Ajmal Kasab and the inability of the erstwhile UPA governments to stand up to a neighbour who fuels terrorism ensured the wave of rightwing politics dividing our country into ‘us’ and ‘them’.

Sushma Swaraj’s oft repeated statement that if one Indian soldier is beheaded, five across the LoC will suffer the same fate attempted to portray the UPA to be soft and effete. Modi, too, derided UPA-2 for not being able to look China in the eye and give a befitting response to incursions. With the media playing ball, BJP exploited the situation to register a massive victory in 2019. Muscular politics captured the minds of simple folk through a well-oiled propaganda machinery.
Modi 2.0 was now ready for more. The time was ripe to capture institutions that were constitutionally designed to check arbitrary power. Modi 2.0 became openly divisive and with arrogance, manipulation and ease, pushed its legislative agenda by making a divided opposition look weak and incapable of resistance. It used agencies to prevent opposition unity, perhaps by adopting a carrot and stick policy. It cleared the Triple Talaq Bill by cleverly projecting BJP’s concern for justice to Muslim women.
At the level of individuals, the manner in which it continues to prosecute alleged ‘urban naxals’ is hardly an act of civility at the hands of the omnipotent State. The omnipresence of loyal soldiers of this government on social media platforms continues to shut out voices of dissent. The government’s programmes and decisions are being eulogised and those who oppose branded anti-national. The czarist manner in which Modi 2.0 restructured Article 370 is yet another example of muscular politics.
The political gain for BJP has been substantial, but in the long run, will be demonstrated to be pyrrhic.
The economic consequences of such muscular political acts can often be disastrous for its victims. Lynching of Dalits has impacted their vocation. Those trading in buffaloes hesitate to transport and sell cattle. This has hugely impacted the lives of millions. Many abattoirs have lost business and traditional sources of employment in this trade have got a beating.
Divisions in society have their own economic consequences. The government has not fully understood the impact of restructuring Article 370 on the survival of Bakarwals, who in the midst of curfew imposed in Kashmir, cannot sell their goats in mandis, a Rs 100 crore business. Perhaps Modi 2.0 did not take into account the impact of the politics of curfew on the sale of apples and pears from orchards in Kashmir, rotting for lack of transportation facilities. The decision of the government to purchase the leftover stock directly has its own complications, which will include pricing and other issues. Nafed has been given little time to do the needful. This is something the government should have thought of in advance.
Unfortunately, this government takes decisions without necessarily calibrating the consequences of such decisions on people’s lives on the ground. Tourism has been severely impacted; so also retail trade in the Kashmir Valley. Taxis hardly ply and the placid Dal Lake is lifeless. Hotels are empty. Thousands of jobs have been lost.
The destruction of lives and livelihoods is a recipe for outcomes we may not be aware of. The muscular way in which the Assam NRC has been compiled has chaotic consequences on those left out. Those who are suffering as a consequence of this muscular politics are the 800 million people in India who earn less than Rs 10,000 a month. A predator who targets even these who live marginal lives, makes life itself a fight for survival.
The muscular way in which the investigating agencies are being used to target the business community again impacts the economic future of India. The sense of fear destroys the hunger for investment. People seek to protect their privacy and their families more than the desire for prosperity. The slogan ‘ease of doing business’ has no takers in an environment where doing business has become hazardous. Exploitative investigations have brought misery at the doorsteps of those who are the backbone of the Indian economy. An income tax raid results in hundreds of man hours spent in non-productive activity.
Muscular politics is good for electoral but not national outcomes.

     1. Congress leader Kapil Sibal has every right to criticize each and every decision of PM Narendra Modi led NDA government. That is his fundamental right and let him enjoy it. 2. However, we citizen-voters cannot forget past. For example, we cannot overlook how late PM Rajiv Gandhi made an unpardonable error of not accepting that the government in power in 1984 in Delhi had miserably failed to protect innocent Sikhs, who were killed in riots after assassination of Smt Indira Gandhi on 31st October, 1984. 3. In this context it is necessary to recognize that even after thirty five years; in 2019 many Sikh families who lost their near and dear ones in 1984 riots feel and feel strongly that justice has been denied to them. Further, let us also not forget an important fact: one of the many accused in 1984 anti-Sikh riots, an influential Congress politician and former MP, has been sent to jail in the year, 2019, yes, almost 35 years after the anti-Sikh riots happened. 4. I believe that the Centre government should have shown political will and administrative courage to give justice to Sikh families after 1984 riots, within a reasonable time. If culprits of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots had been firmly dealt with in an expeditious manner, it would have been a different story in 2002 in Gujarat. I say that if there was a precedent of firm handling of 1984 riots, 2002 riots in Gujarat would have then been brought under control far more quickly and resolutely. But as always the Congress double-speak is evident in this case too. 5. Incidentally, in this context, I am also reminded of one enactment of a law by the Rajiv Gandhi led government in 1986. In this year fundamentalists in the Muslim community in India compelled then PM Shri Rajiv Gandhi to enact â  The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986â   to overturn a Supreme Court decision which upheld rights of divorced Muslim women. Further, worse was that the educated in the Muslim community just succumbed to fundamentalistsâ   pressure. It is true that public memory is proverbially short but we citizen-voters cannot overlook facts. We cannot forget imposition of emergency in 1975....  Read More

But these cases keep recurring with regular frequency and much judicial and police time is expended in dealing with them, not to mention harassment faced by the accused. It is time the Supreme Court or the government bring finality to this issue which makes a mockery of rape laws and the individual liberty granted to consenting adults.

The court has ruled that even if a man makes a false promise of marriage to a woman “only to satisfy his lust” this would fall in the “ambit of cheating and deception”. Likening this to rape is unfair. In India we recognise the agency of an adult to make independent decisions. Consequently, these adults must also take responsibility for the choices they have made, even when they end badly.  Exploiting a loophole in the law to claim rape doesn’t behove a civilised society.

Claiming the consent was secured on false promises is fine but then the case made out should be on cheating and breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code, not rape. Given government’s moralising streak, it remains to be seen if it will do anything that is seen as condoning live-in relationships or giving agency to individuals in such relationships. It will fall to Supreme Court to rectify such injustices like  triple talaq and Section 377 and 497 IPC (criminalising homosexuality and adultery).

     This section  of the IPC was meant to protect the large sections of vulnerable,  illiterate women , predominantly in rural India ,  who for reasons of [desperation, poverty and social vulnerabilities was subject to exploitation by men using their better status. There were many cases where  visiting males would exploit such women,  abandon them and simply go back to their areas of work . This was NOT meant for the urban, educated, liberated sophisticted  woman.The one who claimed her body was hers and she was free to excercise her choices as she felt. So when such a woman makes her choice,has live-in, conssnsual relations for years, benefits out of  it cannot one day suddenly claim shehas been exploited and abused. You cannot have headsI win, tails you lose.  If gender equlityis teh ideal,why make only teh maleliable for the consequences of a 'free'. 'liberated'life style choice....

The Congress has joined with the BJP in backing the mob.
If the Constitution and Supreme Court matter so little, is mob rule going to become the new political norm?
The Congress decries the lynch mobs that have killed Muslims accused of eating or trading in beef. Yet it backs the mob at Sabarimala. So, its opposition to beef lynching looks like a cynical political ploy rather than a matter of principle. If the party believes that Hindu religious feelings cannot trump the rule of law regarding beef, why not Sabarimala too?
The BJP accuses the Congress of pseudo-secularism on the ground of its Muslim appeasement, notably in the Shah Bano case. At Sabarimala, the Congress is guilty of Hindu appeasement. Either way, the once-proud secular party of Jawaharlal Nehru is now firmly pseudo-secular.
The notion that menstruating women are impure and polluting has no basis in the “scientific temper” that Nehru extolled as a philosophical goal. This is not just a Hindu problem. It is a problem in many faiths, including Islam and the Orthodox Christian Church.
Most mosques prohibit menstruating women from praying, and some prohibit even their entry. The famous Haji Ali shrine in Mumbai decided in 2011 to ban Muslim women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the dargah to lay flowers or chadors (sacred sheets) on the Sufi saint’s grave. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a courageous group of Muslim women activists led by Noorjehan Sadia Niaz and Zakia Soman, petitioned the courts saying their fundamental rights were being violated.
The dargah trust gave the Bombay High Court a variety of specious reasons for imposing these restrictions on women. It said that the “free mixing” of men and women was discouraged in Islam, that menstruating women were unclean, and that it was a sin to allow women close to a male saint’s grave. It even alleged that women might “show their breasts” while bending over the grave, and that they wished to protect women from sexual harassment.
None of this explained why women had been allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the dargah from 1430 to 2011, albeit through a separate entrance. If for centuries women were not viewed as unclean trespassers on a sacred spot, how did this become an issue in 2011? If till then millions of Muslim women had visited the shrine without “showing their breasts” when bending down, and hence attracting male molesters, what caused the new concerns of the dargah trust in 2011? Was it a change in female dress fashions? Had seethrough dupattas and kameezes become all the rage? Or had Muslim men suddenly become sexcrazy and uncontrollable in the dargah?
No, the objections of the trust were farcical. The Bombay High Court quite rightly dismissed the objections of the dargah trust and said the inner sanctum should be open to women. The trust appealed to the Supreme Court, but got no relief.
Did the dargah or Muslim males in Mumbai form mobs to flout court orders, and keep women out, as at Sabarimala? No, despite much Muslim dismay and wailing about court intrusions into religious matters, the dargah implemented the court instruction on equal treatment of men and women. It created a separate entry path for women but allowed men and women equally into the sanctum. It built a railing keeping both male and female worshippers some distance from the grave itself. Marvel of marvels, Muslim women did not show their breasts, and Muslim men did not leap on them. Peace and harmony returned to the dargah.
In Swaminomics last week, I pointed out that the BJP had hailed the Supreme Court ban on instant triple talaq as a great victory for women’s rights. Why then did it oppose women’s rights at Sabarimala? Did only Muslim women have rights, not Hindu women?
Some angry Hindus responded that there could be no comparison. They said the issues in triple talaq and Sabarimala were so totally different that it was ridiculous to compare them.
Very good. This column now makes a comparison that is surely valid. In both the Haji Ali and Sabarimala cases, the issue was whether religious traditions on the pollution of holy places by supposedly impure menstruating women could negate their constitutional fundamental rights. In both cases the Supreme Court said no. Its stance was logical and consistent. That cannot be said of either the BJP or Congress.

     Dear Mr. Swaminathan, I beg to differ from your view point. I am surprised at the contents of your article. How can you miss a major point of difference between Haji Ali and Sabarimala? I believe it is deliberate from your part. At Hajiali, they had allowed women till 2011. At Sabarimala, women are not allowed right from beginning. You have conveniently ignored this vital fact while comparing the two.  If a woman do not go to sabarimala, it does not affect her life. There are many temples where they can go and offer puja to deities. This is one temple where due to belief, they are not allowed.  But triple talaq is very important for well being of a muslim woman. You can not compare the two at all. Also, the fact that NO Mosque allows woman in side. Why are you not taking up the same also. All temples allow women inside but one. Same, if done by mosques, we have no problem. When all of them do not allow or only a few allows, there is a problem.  So I hope your next article will be to advocate allowing Women in all mosques (Except few on some valid grounds ;like what we offer at Sabarimala, which may not be acceptable to you but are with some logic.)....

To the Opposition everything the government does is wrong.  To the government, anyone who opposes its policies is `anti-national’.  
Both these extreme positions need to be examined critically.
Everything the government has done or proposes to do, is not wrong.  In fact, several of the things it has done have been positively good, and credit must be given for them. 
The scheme to provide cooking gas cylinders to rural households is one such.  The banning of the practice of triple talaq is another, as will be the promulgation of a common civil code when that happens.  
Similarly, the revoking of Article 370 in J&K was a step long overdue and, in the long run, it shall benefit all Kashmiris.
However, the continued detention of Kashmiri politicians under the drastic Public Securities Act (PSA) needs to be questioned, as a counter-productive measure which exposes the government to charges of human rights violations. 
As regards the CAA, which has sparked cross-community protests against the country, many if not most of those vehemently opposing it would stop doing so if the law did not single out any religious group for exclusion from it.  
On its part, the government should rethink its policy of labelling all protest against it as `anti-national’.   
In a democracy, it is not just the right but the duty of citizens to dissent, and to protest against governmental policies which they feel are detrimental to the body politic as a whole.
Far from being anti-national, such critiques of the government constitute the very essence of true nationalism, which puts the interests of the nation above those of a particular political party or ideology.
From a faltering economy, to joblessness, to Pakistan’s ongoing proxy war against us, to global threats like climate change and the coronavirus pandemic, we face many daunting challenges.
We need to pick up the gauntlet collectively, by rising above our differences and forging a common will to deal with the problems and hazards which confront us.
Sab ke saath, sab ka vikas.  Are we, all together, both pro-government and anti-government, ready to translate that slogan into affirmative action?
That is the real challenge, and the real opportunity, before us.

     Sir, in ademocratic country everyone has full right to express his or her views. So if anyone expresses his or her dissent any of the action of the government it is not at all justified to declare him or her anti-national. To declare him or her anti-national is just to put him or her in the category of criminals and this can not be tolerated by the society at any cost. The learned people in the society always put their views on the actions of the government but this does not mean that they are all anti-nationals. The government only belittles it's own image by doing so. It is totally against the norms of a democratic country. The need of the hour is that the goverment should revise its thinking and policy.

The 4-1 majority judgment found the age-old custom of barring menstruating women an infringement on Hindu women’s right to pray. The Travancore Devaswom Board which runs the 800-year-old Lord Ayyappa temple had argued that the ban was a protected religious custom. But the court disagreed and said that the restriction on women can’t be treated as an essential religious practice. In fact, Chief Justice Dipak Misra affirmed that devotion could not be subjected to discrimination and patriarchal notions cannot trump equality in devotion.

Justice DY Chandrachud said that birthmarks and physiology are not the basis to deny constitutional entitlements and to treat women as children of a lesser god is to blink at the Constitution itself. Meanwhile, Justice Nariman pointed out that fundamental rights were essential for transformation of society. Taken together, the majority judgment clearly implies that religious rights can’t take precedence over fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

This is indeed welcome. A modern democratic society ought to give primacy to the individual rather than community sentiments. In that sense, there are parallels between the apex court’s ruling in the Sabarimala case and its verdict contending the Muslim practice of triple talaq unconstitutional last year. In both cases women’s right to equality was treated as sacrosanct in the face of religious customs. The Sabarimala ban stigmatised women of a certain age and was clearly out of sync with modern mores. The court has done well to break down another patriarchal religious taboo that held women back.

That is despite the ruling being a hesitant, split verdict.
Admittedly, not everyone agrees with this assessment, and some even trivialise the parallels with the historic Shah Bano judgment of 1985. But make no mistake, this is a game changer. For starters, unlike Shah Bano, which was overturned by an act of Parliament in 1986, there is no chance of this being undone.

In fact, it has already rekindled discussion on a uniform civil code (UCC), one of the unfulfilled ‘directive principles’ of India’s Constitution that would replace the existing separate personal laws for Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians.
Those who opposed reforming triple talaq had feared just that, predicting it would pave the way for a UCC. The irony, of course, is that many opponents had traditionally included not just conservative Muslims and religious leaders, but also “secular” politicians and activists.
This interpretation of secularism, defending the rights of minority groups instead of individuals, was always at odds with the construct of a modern democracy whose constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens. But it had its own rationale in Mughal and colonial rule and the turmoil in which India was partitioned and gained independence.
That rationale is best understood by comparing the rights minority groups have historically had in theocratic nations, both conservative and liberal, with the universal rights of all citizens in modern, secular democracies.
At one end of the spectrum are conservative theocracies like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which disallows the public practice of religions other than its state version of Islam.
The middle of that spectrum is exemplified by the erstwhile Ottoman empire, theocratic but relatively liberal. Though its conquest of Constantinople in 1453 was brutal, with massacres, plunder, enslavement and conversion to Islam of many residents, by the 16th century it had become much more tolerant.
The Ottomans’ ‘Millet’ system of jurisprudence allowed every religious community their own laws. This represented a kind of nationhood where the Muslim ruling class retained its preeminence but, in enlightened self-interest, also protected minorities by balancing their rights as groups.
At the other end of the nationhood yardstick are countries like the UK, US, France and Germany. Evolving from monarchies to liberal democracies, they dispensed with both privileges for the majority community, as well as group rights for minorities, replacing them with common rights for all individual citizens.
In the tumult leading up to India’s Independence, the idea that we could aspire to be a modern democratic republic was not accepted widely enough. Thus the two-nation theory, the idea of Pakistan, and Partition.
Nevertheless, our republic’s founders were committed to a modern, secular democracy, not a theocratic Hindu mirror image of Pakistan. But in their anxiety to reassure the remaining minorities, they did not immediately push through the modern, democratic version of secularism.
Instead, they spelled out that aim in the directive principles, but in the interim decided to continue with existing Raj-era separate personal laws. Limited progress thereafter includes enactment of laws against dowry and domestic violence, Hindu personal laws, and the optional Special Marriage Act, all reflecting modern sensibilities.
But despite becoming an established and respected democracy, our medieval kind of secularism had remained like that of the Ottoman empire’s, balancing group rights, rather than like modern democratic republics, focussing on individual rights.
While that might have been expedient to hold together a splintered nation during its initial birth pangs as a republic, the underlying premise is deeply troubling in the long run. For it reinforces the two-nation theory. Separate laws for every religious group in a modern democracy can be justified only if we accept that the majority cannot be trusted to uphold the individual rights of minorities.
In fact, that is precisely what critics of UCC argue, whether explicitly or couched in euphemisms. They cite various aberrations over the past 70 years, including recent cow vigilantism, to assert that India is “not ready” for UCC.
But in reality, despite its many problems, India has proved to be a stable democracy where such horrors are the exception, not the norm. Moreover, institutions like the judiciary and Election Commission continue to inspire confidence, as in the SC’s other landmark judgment last week, making privacy a fundamental right.
Cynicism about UCC undermines the idea of India prescribed by the Constitution. And it does disservice to both our hard won democracy as well as to those who would allegedly suffer when UCC is implemented.
The largely positive reactions to the triple talaq judgment shows India has come a long way in three decades. The court should perhaps have determined triple talaq’s constitutional validity without going into its religious standing. Be that as it may, ruling that a codified religious personal law is unconstitutional opens the door to full-fledged secularism.
Those who worry India might become a “Hindu Pakistan” should take note of a new Pakistani law enacted earlier this year, “The Hindu Marriage Act.” If we are not to be a mirror image of that theocratic nation, this is a reflection we should not want.

     Traditions in Hindus differ from North to South, from East to West India. Will all Hindus agree for uniform civil code?

"1616953672-206","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","Of politics and culture","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Citycitybangbang/of-politics-and-culture/","Of politics and culture","December 20, 2020, 6:06 PM  IST","Santosh Desai","Among the many possible explanations for the sustained rise of the BJP and its growing ability to draw into its fold sections of the society that have historical reason to distrust it, is its ability to harness culture. The party has managed to blur the lines between politics and culture, and has presented itself as the natural choice for the majority community based on the fact it shares common values and a shared ethos.
While the party’s use of religion as an axis of division and aggregation has been widely commented upon, its use of culture in a more everyday sense needs further exploration. The ability of a wider swathe of people to see themselves as an extension of the world created by the BJP goes beyond active religious mobilization. If on the one hand it has succeeded in weaponising religious identity by creating a sense of perpetual victimhood in the majority community, it has also created a sense of affinity by presenting its case in culturally resonant terms.
The sense of identification with the party comes not only account of its ‘big’ initiatives- Ram Janmabhoomi, the invention of the idea of ‘love jihad’, the criminalization of triple Talaq, the abrogation of Article 370 and the like, but also because it uses more everyday motifs that are a part of a more ‘natural’ sense of how Indianness is experienced by the majority community.
For decades during the period when the Congress was ascendant, the separation of politics from cultural life was seen as a natural part of the prevailing political ideology. Notions of secularism and equity were ideas that were almost exclusively political rather than cultural in the manner in which they were framed. Steeped in this mental model of politics, the party did not overtly use cultural motifs nor did it employ any familiar iconography. The desire to speak to different communities meant that politics could not draw too deeply from cultural wells.
This helped electoral politics, at the national level at least, stay outside the perimeter of our social lives. Politics was either the full-time pursuit of a s specific set of people or it was an activity that was performed once every few years, and then forgotten about. The majority thought of themselves as being apolitical, and took some pride in that self-definition.
The BJP has changed that, by bringing cultural issues to the political mainstream. It is a very particular view of culture, rooted in majoritarian impulses, but it does allow the party speak effortlessly to a very large number of voters cutting across the many divisions that exist, except religion of course. It presents its politics as an extension of our natural cultural impulses whereby the dominant blurs into the natural, and feels inevitable.
As part of this strategy, the party exhibits a great comfort with existing social norms, and shows little interest in challenging these. It also understands the power of using cultural symbols in a potent way. The use of the cow is a good example of the difference in the two worldviews. If the reverence for the cow feels like a throwback to primitive impulse that is wholly at odds with modern sensibilities to one side, it feels the acceptance of a long-held and virtually incontrovertible belief to the other. Cows have been held sacred, not in a deity-in-a-temple kind of a way, but in the everyday feed-a-cow-on-the-street kind of a way. Opposing cow protection is an idea that is difficult to fathom. Of course, the BJP has successfully converted what is a relatively low-key cultural practice into a symbol of religious belonging.
The banging of thalis in support of the those on the frontlines of the battle against Covid might have felt ridiculous to a few, but it is another example of how culture becomes politics. By giving people a concrete action to perform, and by making participation a social performance, a power sense of a cultural collective acting in unison was constructed. The fact that such an action was deemed absurd by one group but enthusiastically participated in by so many others underlines the gulf in understanding that exists currently. The fact that in spite of having a not-too-impressive track record in its effort to contain the effects of the virus, this government enjoys such popular support for its handling of the crisis shows how well it understands how to connect with the mainstream in the country.
Apart from the more concrete symbols that can be deployed once culture becomes a part of politics, what it enables is a vocabulary that is effortless. The automatic ease in establishing an emotional bond with the audience that Mr Modi enjoys is a function of the fact that the language that he uses is replete with culturally familiar expressions. the sense that ‘he understands us’ comes not only from the content of his speeches but from the manner in which he invokes a culturally comfortable world. His “Mann KI Baat’ speeches are an explicit example of how the idea of a paternalistic figure who is concerned about people who share his values has been constructed.
Social media has also made politics much more cultural in nature. It becomes possible to make everything political by providing a running commentary on every moment of our lives in terms that are political. Small issues like an ad that allegedly offends Hindu sensibilities can become issues of national import, and succeed in sending a strong message about the power wielded by those dominant today. Things that lay outside the political domain, largely because political conversation did not have any regular platforms nor extended reach, are now easy to include.
The grammar of politics has changed beyond recognition. If there has to be a serious counterpoint to the dominant political force in the country, then it needs a completely fresh mental model of politics. New concepts, a new language, new modes of engaging people, and at the top of the list, new leadership.

     Just leave BJP with its use of culture, which would prove a mere distraction for it. 1. According to a senior journalist, India is doing lamentably bad on a few important indices. For instance, on the Human Freedom Index is it badly beaten by countries like HAITI, LESOTHO, MADXSAGASKAR, BURKINA FASO, NEPAL, AND EVEN LUKASHENKOâ  S BELARUS! BORAT'S KAZAKHSTAN IS AHEAD OF INDIA BY 36 PLACES ON THIS INDEX! 2. On the Global Economic Freedom Index India slide 26 places, from 79 to 105. 3. The annual UNDP Human Development Report says India has fallen two places. 4. India is also not doing well on the Global Hunger Index. ""The Global Hunger Index (GHI) has consistently seen India struggling despite the largest food security programme in the world. But GHI is not about food grain, roti-rice or a full belly. It is about nutrition. Thatâ  s where the NFHS holds up a mirror to us. And what we see is ugly."" Over the past five years, India's economic growth rate has slowed down. ""At the poorer levels of our population, this must be more pronounced. So, families have less and less surplus for nutritious foods: Milk, poultry, meat, pulses, vegetables, fruits. Read the NFHS results, therefore, with the GHIâ  s, and it makes sense."" The author has a warning: ""Because at some stage, this fall in the quality of life will begin to hurt anybodyâ  s popularity. And remember, while you might trash everything else as motivated, or blame Congressâ  s â  70 yearsâ  , the children the NFHS surveyed were all under-5. They were all born under Modi governmentâ  s watch, and the survey concluded well before the pandemic. Thereâ  s no place to hide now."" 5. And culture? The culture kills too!...

It did not have affluent, educated women. They were denied equal inheritance rights and education, and kept at the complete mercy of male masters. Social customs meant women could not stand independently on their two feet, so divorce was not an option.
Education makes people uppity and demand rights, and this outrages those with power. In the era of US slavery, laws made it a crime to educate slaves, for education might give the blighters notions of freedom or equality. In British India, Macaulay and other grandees in London sought to create a cadre of educated Indians to help run the colony. But that idea was hated by the British stationed in India, who loved illiterate peasants (that posed no threat) but hated educated Indians (who were uppity enough to talk of independence).
Ancient Hinduism had no formal divorce procedures. But women could be thrown out by their husbands even on the most outrageous grounds or false rumours (ask Sita).
Bhagwat should celebrate the fact that such terrible gender inequality is now forbidden by the Indian Constitution. This declares there can be no discrimination on the grounds of religion, caste, race, sex, or place of birth. Sadly, all ancient traditions — including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and other faiths —practised all these forms of discrimination. The grey eminences that formulated the Constitution were educated, affluent and arrogant enough to ban the traditional discriminations of all religions.
Hindu tradition gave males power over property, marriage, occupation and all family matters. Marriages were financial deals between parents entailing dowry payments. Child marriage was standard. Katherine Mayo’s ‘Mother India’ lists examples of six-year-old girls hospitalised with crushed pelvises after forced sex with older husbands, who nevertheless wanted their wives back to meet their sexual needs.
Sati condemned women to be burned on the funeral pyres of their late husbands. Men were not expected to immolate themselves on their late wives’ pyres.
Fortunately, women are getting educated and affluent, and are no longer helpless pawns. They can think and act for themselves, including shedding undesirable husbands. Rising divorces are a sign that male tyranny is finally getting contested and punished. This is justice, not arrogance.
A Family Health Survey revealed that one-third of women above 15 years had suffered domestic violence, with broken bones, teeth and eye injuries. Yet only 14% of the sufferers sought to stop it. The good news — Bhagwat may disagree — is that women who went to school are more likely to report violence and will hopefully dump their torturers.
Every faith and tradition has a damnable record of oppressing women. Islam requires a raped woman to produce four witnesses, making it almost impossible for her to complain. Instant triple talaq is an outrage. Many Islamic countries force women to stay home and never move out unless accompanied by a male relative. In Iran, women cannot watch a football match because that will allow them to see exposed men’s legs, and that, apparently, will destroy Islamic society.
A Human Rights report in 2010 in Pakistan says almost 800 women were victims of “honour killings”. Tradition empowered village elders to order the rape, murder or barter of women for love affairs involving them or family members. India is not much better — honour killings continue here too.
Christianity discriminated against women too. Through most of history, Christian countries gave males a monopoly of property and other rights. St Thomas Aquinas, a great philosopher, declared that rape was less sinful than masturbation because rape contained the possibility of procreation, a noble Christian cause, while masturbation did not.
Roman Christian Emperor Constantine defined elopement as rape. If the female had consented, she was burned at the stake along with her male friend. If she had not consented, she was still considered an accomplice on the grounds that she could have saved herself by screaming for help.
Another terrible Christian tradition declared old widows to be devil-worshippers and witches, and so burned alive. The accusations were often brought by greedy male relatives wanting to seize the women’s property.
Fortunately, Europeans have now become affluent and educated enough to become what Bhagwat calls “arrogant”. They denounce ancient traditions as terrible crimes.
Bhagwat is educated and reasonably affluent. Let’s hope this makes him arrogant enough to denounce the many Hindu customs that mistreated women shamefully in the name of tradition.

I thought the films were terrific but needed to be sparer, meaning containing less material. Having said that, for one sequence I was very grateful. At one point, there is a ceremony in which Faisal (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui) weds Mohsina (Huma Qureshi). The shot shows the process, called nikah as we know, and it struck me that I was seeing something new.
The maulvi specified the bride price and the groom and the bride said the word ‘qabiltu’ three times in acceptance of the dower or mahr. I was vaguely familiar with the idea that a nikah is contractual but I had never been witness to a Muslim wedding in person and I had never seen one enacted in a movie. This is remarkable given the number of Indian weddings our movies show, and Indian Muslims will through Bollywood know Hindu wedding ceremonies as well as Indian Hindus.
This week, one of my colleagues pointed out that what the Supreme Court had banned was not triple talaq, but instant triple talaq. Triple talaq is still the way Muslims married under personal law are divorced. Again, how many of us know this and appreciate the difference? Not many. Why is this? The reason is that we exclude three large communities from our popular culture. We know of their existence mostly through cliche and, truth be told, demonisation. These days this is increasingly so because of the horrible turn our journalism has taken, but I’ll bleat about that another time.
Dalits (more than 16%), Muslims (more than 14%) and Adivasis (more than 8%) are about 40% of all Indians but are absent from our representations. We don’t know much about them and their customs. To put this in perspective, Gujaratis who are only 5% of the population, as a community get far more coverage than the three marginalised communities together. And of course the idea of ‘Gujarati’ we hold is limited to vegetarian Hindu merchants.
This month, a middle-class Gujarati man, a civil servant retired from the revenue department, set himself on fire in protest and died (if you missed it it’s possibly because his sacrifice didn’t deserve as much coverage as a reality television star kissing a girl). Bhanubhai Vankar did this to secure the land rights of an old woman, a Dalit. He killed himself to get the rest of us to care about the issue. Why did we not care? Perhaps it is because of hate and insensitivity. But one reason has to be that we don’t know enough.
Something has been occurring to me. What is Adivasi food? Surely they cannot be making palak paneer and tandoori chicken. What is an Adivasi wedding ceremony? Is it a ritual? Is there an Adivasi divorce? What connects the Gujarati Adivasi culturally to the one in Chhattisgarh? Are they endogamous like the rest of us? The fact is that most Indians don’t know the answers. Do we care about them? When I say that ‘we’ are not aware, I am not talking about the unwashed. I’m referring to us, me and you.
What you care about is often only what is shown to you. That is the nub in this story. I am not saying anything new of course, and I recognise that. But things are happening in the world that we should be aware of. We have long ceased to be leaders in anything and we have very little to offer the world, let us accept it. But we can learn.
Black Panther, a movie made in America about Africa and starring African-Americans is in the news for being the sort of thing that Hollywood should make but chose not to till now. I mean the deliberate attribution of universal noble values to minority groups and their individuals and their culture.
The movie is a big hit, one of the biggest in history, and that shows something. Specifically, that some of the biggest cultural assumptions of storytellers about what is popular are wrong. It shows also that the years of calling out of this, the many instance of protest and complaint by non-white artists and creators, played a big role in bringing us here.
By ‘us’ of course I mean Hollywood and its global audiences. I don’t mean our popular imagination and its creators. In 2018 we remain where we were, and this is remarkable given that we are talking about four-tenths of our nation. Their stories and their cultures are as important and as interesting as that of the other six-tenths. There is absolutely no reason to assume that they will be less popular. We should move towards them, even if only to join the rest of the world.

Yet, Congress has chosen a language of religiosity in which to voice its opposition to the BJP. There are better ways to counter politics that mobilises one religious community by positing another as a threat than a competition in religiosity.
It is an empirical reality that almost all leaders of Congress, save Nehru then and Antony now, have been devout followers of their faith. Few of them have been shy of performing religious rites in public. They simply follow the norms of conduct that are natural to the people they represent. It is no big deal.

Rubric of Democracy…
It is best to leave matters at that level. But politics complicates the task. BJP seeks to portray Congress as the party of Muslim appeasement. Congress goes on the defensive, and sends Rahul Gandhi to Mansarovar and to assorted temples across the land, posters hailing him as Shiv bhakt and Congress spokesman calling him janeudhari, one who wears the sacred thread.
The good thing about this is that it shows that Congress sees and steers clear of the trap BJP has laid for it: be labelled the Muslim party, making it easier for BJP to rally the Hindus in a binary polarisation of the electorate.
What is not so good is the hole this leaves in the Opposition’s political platform. Congress puts up fewer Muslim candidates, it is chary of taking on BJP president’s description of Bangladeshis in India as infiltrators and termites, it struggles to differentiate its objections to the Ordinance banning triple talaq from those of the reactionary clerics who insist that patriarchal customs that most Muslim-majority nations have abandoned constitute the core of their faith.
Congress needs a holistic narrative of its own to counter the Sangh Parivar claim, often made subliminally, that it is building Hindu glory by subjugating Muslims and their customs, making them politically irrelevant and forcing them to accept the status of objects of majority patronage rather than of citizens in a land of rich diversity and equal rights and opportunity.
In the freedom movement, nationalism was seen as the opposite of communalism.
That had a passing, contingent validity and utility. An ideology that divided Indian resistance to colonial rule was obviously anti-national. That clarity has gone with the British.
In the face of a movement that seeks to conflate the nation with the majority community, it is not enough to juxtapose nationalism vis-à-vis communalism.
Democracy is the rubric Congress needs for organising its politics against the Sangh Parivar’s. Democracy is not majoritarianism, but a working balance between individual liberty and group rights, including the rights of minorities.
It is absent democracy that makes tribal people vulnerable to the depredations of greedy capital that holds money spent on rehabilitating, compensating and including the projectdisplaced in the prosperity built on their erstwhile land to be money wasted.
It is deficient democracy that makestribal people easy recruits and hostages to Maoist politics, in forsaken parts where the jungle and the law of the jungle are more real than constitutional governance. Arresting activists who defend tribal rights on trumped up charges while withdrawing cases against right-wing conspirators who organise violence against Dalits is again a problem of democracy.
…Spans the Canvas 
Democracy shrivels when the government of the day says it cannot tell the people how much warplanes cost, even if these are bought with their money. When corruption eats up budgetary resources, it is again a matter of democracy.
When frenzied mobs bludgeon minority lives and rights, when the police have licence to kill people in staged encounters and that sense of impunity leads policemen to shoot holes in the cocoon of padded insularity from state excess the middle class had imagined it had, the issue at stake is democracy.
Democracy is the touchstone for determining the validity of custom religious heads champion but people resent.
When Dalits are attacked for daring to ride a horse, grow a moustache or watch upper-caste women dance at community festivals, and the forces of law and order come down on uppity Dalits who try to assert their rights as normal people, it is democracy that is skewered.
Focusing on democracy has the advantage of seeing the people as the principal collective force in politics, rather than money power, caste appeal or a leader’s charisma. When the focus is on mobilising the people to combine and collectively empower themselves, it forces the organisers to seek to balance, rather than give in to, sectional demands — of backward and forward castes seeking reservations, of the steel producer who wants protection from imports and the fabricator who wants steel at the most competitive price.
Democracy underpins the narrative of inclusive growth that Congress must champion.

In his Independence Day speech PM Modi raised the bogey of an uncontrolled population growth which needs to be checked if the nation is to prosper.
“Our rapidly expanding population poses new challenges. There is a section that is well aware of the consequences of uncontrolled population growth. They deserve to be honoured and respected. They… keep their families small… which is also good for the nation. By setting them as examples we need to inspire the segment of society which is not thinking on these lines,” said the PM, adding that we need government schemes to control population growth.
Why this sudden concern about a too-large population? One of the most obvious reasons is of course rampant, and increasing, unemployment, particularly among educated young people, one of the BJP’s prime constituencies.
Because of a sluggish economy – among other factors, such as automation – the number of jobs available are falling far behind the number of job-seekers, all too many of whom hold graduate and even post-graduate degrees.
However, population control through family planning – or family welfare, to use the more politically correct expression – is a long-term solution to unemployment and can’t solve the problem overnight.
Is there a more proximate cause for the PM raising the issue of overpopulation? And which is “the section of society which is not thinking on these lines”?
There is a widespread belief – largely unsubstantiated by empirical data – among certain sections of the majority community that the Muslim population is growing at a faster rate than that of Hindus.
Indeed, several leaders belong to the saffron fraternity have publicly urged Hindus to have large families so as to redress this supposed demographic imbalance.
Were the PM’s words – coming soon after the banning of triple talaq and in widespread expectation of a soon-to-declared uniform civil code – directed at the Muslim community?
Perhaps, or perhaps not.
But it is difficult to dissociate his remarks from another kind of family planning – the planned agenda of the ideological family known as the sangh parivar to promote the cause of Hindutva and majoritarianism at all and any cost.

     In his Independent speech the disappointment that the PM has expressed over the increasing population is just to hide his own inability in providing job to each and everyone. His dream of Achhe din aane wale hain has miserably failed. At the same time he he has once again hit the Muslim people that it is they who have enormously contributed to the increasing population. As compared to muslims the number of children in educated hindu families is less. His clear hint is that the muslims too try to control their population. He still hopes that gradually a day may come when may have an upper hand in each and every field and then his long-cherished desire of Hinduttava will be fulfilled. He is well-skilled in chalking out strategies. Let us see how far he gets success in his own mission....  Read More

Through a series of judgments, Supreme Court has set the agenda for public discourse as never before. While many people have described them as historic, it has also raised alarm bells in some sections of society. What is your take on these judgments?
The sheer frequency of socially-relevant judgments is unprecedented. Judgment in Hadiya case, privacy judgment in Aadhaar case, verdicts on triple talaq, passive euthanasia, decriminalizing of gay sex and decriminalizing adultery are some of them. The common thread of all these judgments is the primacy of individual freedom and personal liberty. It’s laudable as freedom of expression and liberty is facing threats from various regressive forces. At the same time, excessive orientation towards personal liberty at the cost of social values and morals are a matter of serious concern. The decriminalizing of gay sex by repealing section 377 and scrapping of section 497 of the IPC demand serious rethinking.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-111668"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""514"" height=""485"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1-3.jpg 514w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1-3-300x283.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"">

There are far-reaching consequences for these judicial pronouncements. The freedom enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution is not absolute. The law says no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty “except according to the procedure established by the law”. Fundamental rights are subjected to reasonable restrictions. These restrictions are necessary for smooth functioning of a harmonious and socially-cohesive society. A society that is devoid of time-tested moral values will lead only to chaos.
Can you elaborate?
God has created all living beings in pairs and its basic purpose is procreation. All religious ideologies have treated gay sex as sin. Decriminalization of gay sex poses serious challenge to the institution of marriage. It seems the court is fast moving towards western radical liberalism and it may not be suitable for a country like India with various belief and cultural systems.
In the case of adultery, the court should have made section 497 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, and section 198 of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (which prohibits wives from filing adultery complaints) gender neutral and not unconstitutional. The present judgment will lead to breakdown of marriages and the future of children from these marriages will be at peril.
The Supreme Court has stated that if any of the spouses commit suicide because of the adulterous relationship by the other spouse, then one would be able to prosecute under section 306, which relates to abetment of suicide. This will lead to an increase in suicide rates out of marital disputes. The court should have directed the government to make adultery an offence under section 498(A) of the IPC 1860.
I recently attended a legal conference in Kuala Lumpur organized by United Nations and the whole discussion was centred on how to integrate moral values in the UN human rights charter. The conference called for a Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities on par with Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Despite having strong views on these issues, no Muslim group impleaded in the case. Why?
I would say it was a grave lapse on the part of Muslim community leaders. They should have presented their views in court and explained the serious threats these changes pose to our social fabric. Since these changes will have serious consequences for the entire society, not just Muslims, they have a moral responsibility to uphold the universal moral values that serves as glue to our social life. The community should have impleaded in the case based on the concept of greater common good of the society.
Even in the triple talaq issue, the stand taken by All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) was not right. Instead of exposing the agenda behind the move that unnecessarily brought triple talaq to Supreme Court, AIMPLB wanted to protect the provision of triple talaq. It is a fact that the present Muslim personal law is largely based on precedence, not fundamental sources such as Quran and hadith. Muhammadan Law, on which the Muslim personal laws rely, is male chauvinistic in nature. AIMPLB should come forward to codify the Muslim personal law in accordance with authentic sources. There should be a concerted effort from the political class to bring necessary legislation through Parliament. The latest Law Commission report has also stressed the need of codification of personal laws.
Will Uniform Civil Code help solve these differences?
No. India is a confluence of myriad cultures and belief systems. Bringing all of them under a uniform civil law is impractical and the Law Commission itself has rejected the idea and said ‘it’s neither necessary nor desirable’. The commission urged the government to first bring equality within communities between men and women rather than equality between communities. So, the focus should be on elimination of gender-based discriminations. It says “most countries are now moving towards recognition of difference and the mere existence of difference does not imply discrimination, but is indicative of a robust democracy.” So plurality of personal laws should be the norm of our judicial system.
Those who argue for uniform civil code do not envisage a civil code based on equality and justice but seek to impose a brahmanical civil code. None of the communities are in favour of repealing their personal laws. Only certain groups with certain political agenda are clamouring for uniform civil code.

It aligns India’s Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.
For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality — across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority’s will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy.

     Nobody can quash Triple Talaq. Triple Talaq is part and parcel of juriprudence of the Faith. One cannot touch or remove this fibre from the whole. What they have done is merely directed that the due process as stipulated by the Faith be followed as prescribed..they have shepherded them in the right direction...

The ban should be revoked and all men, women and children urged to see the film. Many will hang their heads in shame to see their own inner convictions being articulated by the rapist in the documentary. What the ban will achieve is to prevent the questioning of societal values that would follow.
All through the protests over the ghastly rape and murder of Nirbhaya, the targets of popular ire were the state and its law enforcement machinery. Very few sought to challenge social values that deem women, who move out of locations of time and space ordained to be safe and virtuous, fair game for sexual predation, and the victims of predation, zinda lash (living cadavers). What the present documentary seeks to achieve is to question those values.

“The documentary India’s Daughter holds up a mirror to society, it tells us how bad our mindset is, how we look at our own children. But how many of us are willing to look in the mirror and see what’s there?” So said Badrinath Singh, Nirbhaya’s father.
India’s traditional culture is highly iniquitous towards those low down in society organised as a hierarchy of castes and towards women, with women in the ritually inferior castes bearing the brunt of discrimination.

That women should not cross their Laxman Rekha is dinned into our heads by the most elemental of our epics, the Ramayana. Sita, who steps outside the line drawn for her, gets kidnapped by a demon and ends up abandoned by her husband, howsoever virtuous she might have been in her own self. Protected by her father in childhood, by her husband in youth and by her son in old age, the woman does not deserve freedom, pronounces the Manusmriti, with the full force of Brahmanical authority resonating in every word of the life sentence it passes on every girl child as soon as she is born.
The Islamic influence turned out to be no less patriarchal, with the mullahs sanctifying polygamy, easy divorce by the husband via the triple talaq and the pernicious notion that a woman who is not covered from head to toe is a threat to society’s morals.
The notion that simply by going to school and college and joining the workforce outside the home women rid themselves of subjugation to patriarchal ideology is, of course, pure nonsense. Doubly vulnerable to sexual predation are such women, who find themselves in an urban physical environment and are socialised into a superficial modernity that makes a woman emphasise her sexuality over other parts of her persona in her normal deportment.
Substantive democracy would kill patriarchy and liberate women. Women’s right to equality with men is an integral part of India’s march to democracy. However, most political parties only play lip service to women’s equality and most leaders of most parties are more keen to reinforce traditional values about women than to alter them.
The BBC documentary maker’s right to air views that many will find discomfiting is part and parcel of the freedom of expression that is as integral to democracy as the right to equality is. Banning India’s Daughter is an attack on democracy on both counts.

Even those in the Muslim community that have misgivings over judicial interference in faith-based community practices appear to have chosen the path of tactical retreat in the belief that there are bigger battles to be fought over polygamy and the principle of separate personal laws. Certainly, the different judgments have ignited a hitherto lazy debate over reforms of Muslim personal laws, and for a civil code that goes beyond faith and custom and is applicable to all Indians.
The significance of the abolition of triple talaq shouldn’t be underestimated. The Supreme Court has heralded the first major modification of Muslim personal laws in 80 years. Nearly 30 years ago, a similar attempt to grant maintenance to divorced Muslim women had faltered because the Rajiv Gandhi government, despite enjoying a brute parliamentary majority, lacked the moral backbone to stand up to sectarian pressure. The Shah Bano saga is, however, unlikely to be repeated now. On the contrary, the end of triple talaq may energise attempts to enlarge the scope of gender justice through either legislation or judicial pronouncements.
India’s socio-political landscape has changed dramatically since 1987-88. First, and very reassuringly, the outlawing of triple talaq has been endorsed by a significant section of Muslim women, particularly from the middle classes. Unlike the past when it was left to the likes of Arif Mohammad Khan to fight a lonely battle, the past decade has witnessed an increasing number of Muslim women willing to speak out against gender injustice. A section of India’s population that had remained invisible in the past are now partially visible. On its part, the women’s movement has shed earlier inhibitions about not speaking out on injustices in ‘minority’ communities.
Secondly, and arguably for the first time since Independence, India has a government at the Centre that is not even remotely susceptible to political blackmail by the clerical orthodoxy. It is significant that apart from Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Yadav, most of the other mainstream ‘secular’ leaders were compelled to welcome the Supreme Court judgment. This, despite their stated position that personal law reform must flow from within the concerned community and not be imposed from above.
A desire to prevent Prime Minister Narendra Modi — who spoke about the regressive consequences of persisting with triple talaq in his Independence Day address — from running away with the credit and acquiring the mantle of social reformer, was a clear factor. Equally, there was the realisation that ‘minorityism’ now carries diminishing political returns. Three decades ago, Rajiv Gandhi was intimidated by the threat of a Muslim revolt against the award of a paltry alimony to an abandoned woman. Modi has no such fears. In Assam and Uttar Pradesh, the BJP demonstrated it is possible to override the sectarian veto through countervailing mobilisation. Paradoxically, the much decried ‘polarising’ approach attributed to Modi and Amit Shah has become the guarantor of the irreversibility of the triple talaq judgment. India’s liberal politics may have its charms but it has invariably succumbed to pressure from the ghettoes.
The real reason why scrapping triple talaq has drawn relatively less flak is because it was an apex court judgment. Had the court directed the government to sanctify the judgment with parliamentary legislation — the minority view of Chief Justice Khehar — the whole business would have become extremely cluttered. The very same parties that welcomed the apex court judgment would have developed second thoughts and been subjected to sustained pressure from Muslim orthodoxy. No doubt the BJP would have loved a battle that would have exposed the existential dilemmas of the ‘secular’ parties — Mamata at least is being honest in her espousal of old-fashioned vote bank politics — but the clash could well have been bitter and ugly, and even have spilled over to the streets.
By being clear in its verdict the judiciary has averted this tension. At the same time it has further increased India’s dependence on judge-made laws, a phenomenon that, in effect, undermines the supremacy of Parliament. It will be interesting to see if Modi’s New India can reclaim the turf in a future battle over polygamy.
In the meantime, India can reflect over why it took seven decades to undo a glaring injustice to Muslim women. And why in the end it was so remarkably easy. As Roosevelt famously said: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

"1616952937-32","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/13/?s=triple+talaq","Don’t mess with secularism","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Politiconomy/dont-mess-with-secularism/","Don’t mess with secularism","February 8, 2016, 3:00 AM  IST","Salman Soz","If you believe in India’s secular ideals but have some concerns about how secularism has unfolded, any idea seeking reforms attracts attention. Sadanand Dhume’s recent article in these columns – “Reinventing Indian Secularism” (January 29) – was interesting enough to merit this rejoinder.
While i agree that Indian secularism needs reforms, Dhume’s perspective is one-sided, lacks objectivity and promotes a Muslim-centric discourse that appears to have become a mainstream narrative. Still, i welcome opportunities to debate critical issues that remain important to India’s future. Many opinion makers, especially those on the right of the political spectrum, have long argued that India tolerates Muslim practices that are out of sync with a modern, pluralistic society. In support of this argument, Dhume cites the example of Muslims outraging recently against a foul mouthed Hindutva adherent. Mamata Banerjee’s cosying up to Muslim clerics in Bengal, or the rise of “Muslimfirsters” (the first time i have heard this term) like Azam Khan or Asaduddin Owaisi – who want special rights for their community – are also cited.
The usual examples of Muslim personal law and issues like triple talaq (in one sitting) or polygamy among Muslims are used to argue that Indian secularism has gone astray. Such opinion makers push forward the notion that Muslims sticking to old ideas, politicians pandering to Muslims and emergence of Muslimfirsters are the real obstacles to a new, modern secularism.
That pandering to Muslims has occurred is undeniable. We must reject it because it damages Muslims and our broader society. But, is that the entire story? Is pandering specific to Muslims alone? Do politicians not pander to Hindus or Sikhs or other groups? Why talk about Malda and forget the hounding out of M F Husain, one of India’s foremost painters? Or protests by Sikhs last year against the burning of portions of the Guru Granth Sahib? Taking offence is not exclusively a Muslim trait; it is an Indian trait! While both Dhume and i may favour unfettered freedom of expression, the reality today is that anything perceived as an insult by a religious or another identity group invites a strong backlash.
Those familiar with my views know that i am a strong proponent of reform in Muslim practices. Yet, i cannot help but view with a degree of scepticism the characterisations that underlie the call from certain quarters for reforms in Muslim practices.
Yes, some Muslims still hold on to obscurantist ideas such as polygamy, or triple talaq divorce. But should there not be an acknowledgement that polygamy is hardly confined to Muslims? Survey findings reported in Scroll.in (July 8, 2014) indicate there is no evidence to suggest that Muslims in India are systematically more polygamous than members of other communities. In fact, they may be even less so.
Furthermore, there is no evidence to indicate that triple talaq (in one sitting) is the predominant form of divorce among Muslims. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has interpreted triple talaq as acceptable. Yet, many scholars and ordinary Muslims, especially women, have condemned this regressive practice.
The criticism that so-called secularists condemn Hindutva transgressions but stay silent on Muslim extremism is simplistic. Memories are short but a little research will show that Muslim extremism receives much attention and condemnation. For example, after the Nadimarg massacre in 2003, in which over two dozen Kashmiri Pandits were killed, strong condemnations followed from across the political spectrum, including from many Muslim organisations.
Yes, holding extremists accountable can be selective at times. But, that selectivity is not specific to Muslim extremism. Remember, Akbaruddin Owaisi was thrown into jail for hate speech while Pravin Togadia, considered a serial offender by the home ministry under hate speech laws, has Z category security, a status symbol in India. These are fragments from a much broader picture that does not lend itself to facile analysis.
Beyond this, we have to appreciate that Muslims remain a vulnerable and backward minority. Improving their lives means strengthening India. Yet, any serious attempt to improve their standing is dubbed as “Muslim appeasement”.
In 2014, the Kundu Committee set up to evaluate implementation of the Sachar Committee report (2006) found that poverty among Muslims “remained higher than the national average between 2004-05 and 2011-12. In terms of consumption expenditure, Muslims are third from the bottom – after the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes”.
But these facts don’t concern rightwing intellectuals. They would rather focus on a false narrative of a pampered Muslim minority that is privileged by Indian secularism.
Let us be clear: Muslims must embrace modernity and be open to criticism. This is no different from efforts to seek reforms of the caste system. But, it is one thing to promote ideas of reform in a community and quite another to make it seem like it is only one community that blocks secularism 2.0 in India.
Such an approach may suit a particular narrative but it fails the litmus test of objectivity. Instead, we must promote equal opportunity and focus on ending discrimination in different aspects of Indian life. That would be a secular leap forward for all Indians. I am confident this will also yield a better assimilated and a more modern Muslim community.

It can be traumatic or it can bring relief after a harrowing marriage. What it should never be is unilateral, where one party can divorce the other arbitrarily without bringing just legal processes into play.
This week a study published by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) said that 92.1 per cent of Muslim women want oral triple talaq to be banned in India. The practice, sanctioned by Muslim personal law, permits a man to divorce his wife simply by uttering the word “talaq” three times. He owes her no explanation, he need provide no maintenance – he can coolly banish her from the marital home after pronouncing the dread word.
BMMA, which conducted the survey on 4710 Muslim women across 10 states, also said that there are many cases nowadays where the talaq is conveyed to a woman via a text message, a telephone call or on Skype. Astoundingly, these virtual missives are also regarded as full and final decrees of divorce that brook no dissent.
The sheer injustice of the practice needs no debate. It has left thousands of Muslim women abandoned and impoverished — and millions of others cowering under the threat of summary divorce.
Yet Muslim orthodoxy in India, spearheaded by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has always defended the triple talaq strenuously, terming any suggestion to reform Muslim personal law as motivated and tantamount to religious interference.
Ironically, triple talaq delivered at one go is banned in several Islamic countries around the world, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Many of these countries have also set up arbitration councils that try to help couples resolve their differences. Yet in India, the government has always genuflected before hardline views and baulked at making a concerted attempt to do away with the discriminatory practice.
To be sure, Muslim women’s groups in India have long campaigned for the abolition of triple talaq. For years they have been demanding reforms in Muslim personal law, which is widely perceived to be skewed against the interests of women. BMMA’s study found that an overwhelming 91.7 per cent of the women surveyed wanted a ban on polygamy too. (In India Muslim men are allowed to have four wives.)
“They want an elaborate codified law based on the Koranic justice framework to cover matters such as age of marriage, divorce procedures, polygamy, maintenance and custody of children,” a BMMA statement said.
Remember that as it stands, the interpretation of the Muslim personal law can be utterly shocking at times. In 2005, after Imrana, a woman in Muzaffarnagar, was raped by her father-in-law, the clerics declared that under Sharia, she could no longer stay with her husband as “sexual relation” with her father-in- law had made her relationship with her husband null and void.
Again, while polygamy is outlawed in many Islamic countries such as Turkey and Tunisia, in India Muslim men enjoy that privilege under their personal law. Even in Pakistan and Bangladesh, married men need to get written permission from the first wife and then appear before a council before they can hope to bring a second wife into the picture.
In 2012 Justice Kamini Lau, then additional sessions judge at Delhi’s Tees Hazari Court, gave a landmark judgment where she dismissed an argument that according to Sharia law, a Muslim man is allowed to have four wives at a time. “Even in countries governed by Sharia (Islamic) law, the second marriage is permitted under special circumstances such as an illness of the first wife or her inability to bear children. In these cases, with the first wife’s consent, a man may marry again and this is referred to as polygamy, a subset of polygamous marriages. The Holy Quran permits a Muslim man to marry more than one woman at a time (up to a maximum of four), but does not encourage such behaviour,” stated Lau.
Of course, the AIMPLB has never supported the idea of Indian civil courts interpreting Sharia. But many wronged Muslim women who find the clerics and the likes of AIMPLB members unsympathetic to their concerns, often have no other option but to appeal to civil courts.
Can the government ignore the groundswell of sentiment in this regard? Happily, there are indications that the authorities are giving the matter a serious thought at last. In July this year, a 14-member committee on the status of women set up in 2013, recommended a ban on oral triple talaq. One hopes that the report, lying with the ministry of women and child development, will be taken up for deliberation soon.
Needless to say, any attempt to abolish the triple talaq and codify Muslim personal law will be a political hot potato. It will be stiffly resisted by bodies such as the AIMPLB. But the government can scarcely sit by silently and watch thousands of women face this gross cruelty and injustice. Clerics and AIMPLB members must be made to understand that bringing in a just and equitable personal law will benefit not just Muslim women, but ultimately, the community as a whole.

It is no longer possible for a Muslim man to cast away a marriage in an instant. Hearteningly, reform in family law hasn’t stopped there. Now SC has given family courts the freedom to waive the six-month cooling period in cases of divorce by mutual consent, under the Hindu Marriage Act.
It might seem odd to applaud the court putting the brakes on divorce in one case, and making it simpler in another. Except, the battle is not to make divorce harder but fairer. A couple should not be forced to stay locked in marital harness. The terms of parting, though, should be just, taking into account the investment of each party in the marriage and their situation thereafter, fairly dividing matrimonial assets, which is not the case in India yet.
Across religious communities, divorce and maintenance can be made more just. Irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be recognised as grounds for divorce too – so that you can part without having to come up with claims of spousal wrongdoing, cruelty, adultery or mental breakdown. The Delhi high court is also hearing a PIL on another flaw in the Hindu law, whereby a spouse can plead for ‘restitution of conjugal rights’, forcing the estranged partner into cohabitation. This clause violates privacy and autonomy, and should have no place in modern family law.

     Supreme Court and High Courts should open a separate window to address this issues on priority basis. People will knock the doors of courts, when the mutual consent and negotiations will not be established or accepted to both the parties. it is high time to consider this and resolve the issue on soon as possible and priority basis....

What is your view of US President Donald Trump courting Saudi Arabia during his visit there?
One of President Trump’s campaign promises was to eradicate the ideology of radical Islam and to kick start the economy. It’s absolutely true that you have to go to Saudi Arabia because that’s where the heart of radical Islam lies. The trade relationship is a contradiction. If the US wants to have trade relations with Saudi Arabia then they should pressurise them to change their stand on radical Islam. I feel that Saudi Arabia can eradicate radical Islam from within the country on its own because they fund their ideology. Saudi Arabia and US have no values in common. This relationship is unworkable.
What hopes do you have from Saudi Arabia’s new crown prince Mohammed bin Salman?
I hope he succeeds and takes on the clerical establishment of Saudi Arabia. The new crown prince wants to modernise the Saudi economy. He seems to want to make Saudi Arabia like UAE. If he succeeds then radical Islamists would have to take a back seat. The institution of clergy in Saudi Arabia is very strong. I feel there will be a fight between the young prince and clergy. I hope he wins and Salman definitely has Donald Trump on his side.
Isn’t this US-Saudi realignment a big break from the Obama administration?
When Saudi Arabia quarantined Qatar, US was not convinced that Qatar was the only black sheep. Former US President Barack Obama had empowered Iran by having a deal with them. Now, we are back to having a relation of hostility between Iran and US.
What do you think of Trump’s talk of a Sunni coalition with Israel to take on Iran?
This is much more complex than Trump believes. America has relations with other nation-states and there are tribes and sects within the Middle East. The idea of a Sunni coalition taking on Iran is easier said than done. Egypt wants Saudi Arabia as its Muslim ally to fight against Iran. The Egyptian government is terrified of radical Islamists. No one is talking about Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey has Islamised the entire country. He is seen as the caliph of all Muslims. He is a Sunni and his relationship with Saudi Arabia and Egypt is really bad.
Do you feel that Trump’s visit has revamped US Middle East policy?
What was that policy? It has always been a very chaotic relationship after the fall of Soviet Union. Till now, it was a one-sided relationship where the US gave these countries what they wanted. In return, America didn’t get much back.
I think the Saudi visit was a transactional gesture by President Trump. During his campaign Trump had said that he is a deal-maker. I think at this point he feels that he can make a deal with the Saudis. We should wait and watch to see when the deal is made.
Trump has urged Muslim leaders to lead the fight against radicalisation. Your response?
Muslim leaders will fight and some are fighting radical Islamists only when it threatens their own power.
What is the primary problem with radical Islam?
Radical Islamists are promoting a global world view which is destabilising us. Look at all the civil wars which radical Muslims have started. Bangladesh is well in the frame to become a serious democracy. There are established madrasas in Dhaka where a lot of money is coming from Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries. These seminaries produce people who hack people to death simply because they don’t agree with them. The reaction by the Bangladeshi government is to silence the ones who are speaking. Pakistan has not made up its mind where it stands on radical Islamists. Compare Pakistan to India. India is a thriving economy but Pakistan has made itself a backward country because of radical Islamists.
Should triple talaq stay in Islam?
It is glaringly unfair to women. India being a democracy should reject this completely and all other aspects of Sharia.
How do you respond to those who call you anti-Islam?
It is nonsense. I reject Sharia.

Queen Victoria no longer rules, bring rapists to book instead","December 10, 2017, 7:20 PM  IST","TOI Edit","Supreme Court has admitted a petition demanding annulment of the Indian Penal Code provision criminalising adultery, citing its gender discriminatory character. SC will examine whether Section 497 IPC treats the man as adulterer and a married woman as victim and why the offence of adultery ceases if the husband consented to the relationship. Of course fixing liability for an adulterous relationship on the man, that too only if the husband of the married woman objects, is absurdly sexist. But SC must also examine another fundamental question. Is adultery a crime, and secondly, does criminalising adultery, which would entail peeking into consensual relationships and bedrooms and is a remnant of Victorian mindsets – IPC dates back to 1860 – violate individual liberties?
Marriage is essentially a civil contract between two individuals and there can certainly be ethical objections to lying or cheating in a relationship founded on trust. At worst adultery is a violation of contract, not a criminal offence. Most Western nations have decriminalised adultery relegating the biblical commandment forbidding adultery to the realm of religion. The state should legislate on marriages, only to the extent of protecting rights of stakeholders. For instance, triple talaq should be outlawed because it discriminates against women. But prescribing jail terms for violators is counterproductive and will only vitiate civil divorce and alimony proceedings. Further, what punishment will governments prescribe for men who abandon wives without formally divorcing them?
It is critically important to draw clear separations between consensual sexual activity and moral policing and between reasonable and arcane/draconian legislations. Madhya Pradesh has passed a bill mooting death penalty for rapists whose victims are less than 12. Besides disregarding “rarest of rare” stipulation, the law provides perverse incentive to rapists to kill their victims to destroy evidence. Draconian laws only lead to more injustices.
Similarly, rape laws fail to make allowances for teenage sexuality or relationships souring between adults and not culminating in marriage. After much harassment, it is left to courts and conscientious judges to sift fact from bruised pride. Recognising agency of adults to take responsibility for their lives will free up the state to focus its energies where they are critically needed. Just one in every four reported rape case ended in conviction in 2016. Instead of moral policing, the state and legal system must focus more on real crimes.

"1616953668-205","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","The ‘silent’ voters of Bihar","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/the-silent-voters-of-bihar/","The ‘silent’ voters of Bihar","November 20, 2020, 10:59 AM  IST","Priti Gandhi","The BJP-JD(U) combine has won the Bihar elections and Nitish Kumar has returned as the Chief Minister for the fourth consecutive term. But the focus has been on his (newly appointed) two Deputy Chief Ministers, Tarikishore Prasad and Renu Devi. Both grass-root BJP legislators for multiple terms, who have always maintained a low profile, are a surprise selection by the BJP for the Deputy Chief Ministerial post replacing the name synonymous with Bihar BJP – Sushil Modi.
It was a special feeling filled with great joy and pride to see Renu Devi, a self-made woman from the Extremely Backward Caste having risen the ranks within the BJP with her sheer hard work, standing in the corridors of power, taking the oath of the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar. Incidentally, the women voters of Bihar have been major contributors in the NDA winning Bihar and making her appointment possible.
A famous sociologist once said, “There is no force equal to a woman determined to rise!” – This quote applies not just to Renu Devi, it also applies to the women voters of Bihar. It is these determined women who have proven to be the game changers in the recent elections held in Bihar, a state in which 50% of the voters are women. Of the total 7.29 crore voters in Bihar, 3.44 crore voters are women. In the 2020 Bihar assembly elections, 58.8% women voters turned out to vote as compared to 52.92% men. Women voters outnumbered men in 166 out of the total 243 assembly constituencies. Of these 166 constituencies, BJP won the maximum seats – 55. With such enthusiasm, awareness and active interest in the celebration of democracy, women have not only proved that they fully understand the power and value of their franchise but they have also ended up reciprocating the concern and care that came their way when migrants returned to Bihar during the COVID lockdown and also in the form of various schemes launched along the years by the State as well as the Modi government at the Centre.
It is a well known fact that the Lalu Yadav era was well known as the ‘jungle raj’. This was a time when people were scared to leave their homes after sunset for the fear of being murdered or kidnapped. To make matters worse, children lost out on education and the youth was sucked into the nexus of crime. Women of Bihar were the biggest sufferers during Lalu Prasad Yadav’s reign of terror. Helpless, they suffered in silence, waiting for the right time to respond.
It is quite surprising that even the most experienced political pundits analysing Bihar failed to connect the dots and analyse which side the wind is blowing while predicting the election results of Bihar. They simply missed the strong sentiment of the women voters who were in no mood to see a revival of the jungle raj under the RJD rule that they had suffered for so many years. It was still very fresh in their minds.
NDA government’s strong connect with their women voters did not happen overnight. After the NDA government came to power in Bihar in 2005, to make up for the years of neglect, a lot of emphasis was given to women empowerment. The state encouraged women by giving them a bigger representation in the local administrative bodies and even in the Bihar Police force. Girls and young women were able to comfortably pursue their higher education after the state government offered them cash rewards as an incentive to study further. To reduce the gender gap in schools, girls were even provided with free bicycles. Such schemes improved attendance of girls in school, their dropout rate decreased considerably and it instilled great confidence in them and their parents, something for which they give full credit to the NDA government. Prohibition of liquor has been yet another game changer, which had a very positive impact on the women of Bihar.
Alongside the Social empowerment of women in the state, women are simultaneously being empowered economically, right up to the grassroots . Bihar has very systematically and successfully implemented the ‘National Rural Economic Transformation Project’ (NRETP), a government of India and World Bank initiative that engages millions of women in income generation activities to make them self reliant – ‘Atmanirbhar’. This initiative helps mobilization of the poor into Self help groups and their capacity building and skill development is taken up in a systematic manner. Their energies are being channelised very productively.
Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it has been ensured that gender equality is given priority in all aspects. The thrust and emphasis on women empowerment post-2014 have become even stronger. Whether it is the ‘Jan Dhan Yojana’ that gives a woman affordable access to financial services like remittances, credit, insurance and pensions directly in their bank accounts or it is the Modi government’s ambitious ‘Jal Shakti’ piped water scheme that promises piped water to every single household by 2021, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s good governance model is having a very positive impact on the quality of life of women.
Since 2017, Bihar also witnessed a turnaround in its sanitation landscape. The state doubled the number of toilets constructed and its sanitation coverage in rural areas improved from 32% to a whopping 65%. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship programme, the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, over 40 lakh toilets have been built in Bihar since 2017. Even though there is still a long way to go, Bihar’s improvement in sanitation coverage is praiseworthy. Even the landmark ‘Ujjwala Yojana’ that provides free LPG connections to women from Below Poverty Line families has already benefitted more than 35 lakh families in Bihar. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s massive efforts started showing results on ground, the women of Bihar started realising that their sensitive and visionary Prime Minister has real solutions to their everyday problems, that he understands that a self respecting woman has had to often wait for hours before she can answer nature’s Call and it is her basic human right to have access to a toilet, or the fact that he has ensured that they no longer have to inhale smoke and shorten their life span while cooking food for their families.
In last six years, unimaginable legal steps have also been taken to introduce laws that are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to women empowerment and protection of girls. Following an outcry over the rape and murder of a minor girl in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir and the rape of a young woman in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, the Modi government introduced the Criminal law (amendment) bill 2018 which provides for the death penalty for rape of a girl child less than 12 years of age. This was followed by another gigantic reform for women, the Triple Talaq Bill that was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 30th July 2019 after much debate and deliberation. It made the Muslim practice of ‘instant divorce’ a criminal offence. These massive, bold reforms carried out by the Modi government and his unconditional support for women won hearts across the length and breadth of the country, cutting across caste and religion barriers, making him the most preferred choice of the woman voter today.
Another very important factor that should have been taken into account by the political commentators while predicting the future of Bihar and its voting pattern was the successful outreach of the Modi govt when migrants from across the country were returning to their homes in Bihar, after the COVID-19 lockdown. Special trains operated very systematically by the Central government brought back almost 25 lakh migrants back into the state. Not only was money transferred directly into the ‘Jan Dhan’ accounts of women but they were also provided with free food grains and pulses for months together by the Modi Sarkar. Bihar is also the biggest beneficiary of the ‘Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan’ an ambitious ?50000 crore scheme to provide jobs to returnee migrant workers. The humongous efforts taken by the Modi government for COVID-19 affected people in Bihar most definitely converted into support for them at the ballot box.
Data released by the election commission has proved that women of Bihar had made up their minds that they wanted Bihar to continue to move forward under the able leadership of the Narendra Modi-Nitish Kumar combination. They used their franchise wholeheartedly. They ensured that they are equal contributors in Bihar’s path to progress. They ensured that Bihar won!

"1616953998-279","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=triple+talaq","Will criminalisation of Triple talaq signal end of nikahs?","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/heartchakra/will-criminalisation-of-triple-talaq-signal-end-of-nikaah/","Will criminalisation of Triple talaq signal end of nikahs?","June 22, 2019, 3:18 PM  IST","Pooja Bedi","The Triple talaq bill entered Lok Sabha for discussion and with the BJP pro, it and the opposition against it, the future of lakhs of Indian citizens will be soon determined. The Supreme Court has already ruled Triple talaq unconstitutional in August 2017. This bill, however, will make Triple Talaq a non-bailable criminal offence. The issue we are confronted with is whether the misuse of such a law, made with intention for protection of women, be yet another weapon created which can be misused by women against men. If the Supreme Court has already ruled Triple talaq unconstitutional how does it change things by criminalising it? As a woman, it feels great to have laws on your side, until a woman targets your son, brother, father or uncle with its misuse. Any woman can lodge a fictitious complaint stating she victimized by Triple talaq and throw her husband behind bars. We have already seen sections 498 A, domestic violence and 376 (rape) being misused by women for personal gain, manipulation, extortion, and vendetta. The data and statistics of misuse of these laws is pegged at 53% by Delhi Commission of Women (2013-14) However, most men’s rights activists state that almost 70% of all Domestic violence cases are a gross misuse of the law. Even if you put it at a conservative 30% it still means lakhs and lakhs of men and their families being victimised, penalised, tortured and torn apart. We need to examine what happens to our society with the misuse of such laws. The sad reality is that these laws are equivalent to weapons and women are not afraid to misuse them. There are lakhs of innocent men in jail and lakhs who are about to be put in jail and it will naturally breed a mindset of misogyny after such an experience. In addition, men watching the rising statistics of misuse are increasingly scared to flirt, date, live-in or marry women. Do we want to live in fear and distrust-based society? CNBC states that 60% of men are scared to mentor women in their workspace. Do we want good women losing out on jobs based on the growing fear and distrust because multitudes of conniving women are misusing laws? Also, does criminalising Triple talaq and giving women yet another weapon that can be misused, mean the imminent death of marriages by Islamic ceremonial rites and become a law that pushes Muslims to marry only under the Indian law?
I am a college girl from a conservative family. A classmate is very good friend of mine, but of late I have felt a different vibe from her. I think she is attracted to me. She has never come out about her sexual orientation and since I am not sure I cannot ask her outright, especially because I feel she is in love. I am straight but I love her as a friend. And I will feel so very bad if she is hurt in any way. What should I do? Should I confront her? 
The word confront is hostile. It automatically means at loggerheads. Instead, very casually in conversation bring up the conversation of a friend who is homosexual and how it’s wonderful that laws today support him, and make it clear that though you could never be with someone of the sex it’s wonderful that those who choose to, are able to do so today. This will make things amply clear and if she still makes you feel uncomfortable, you have every right to keep a distance. You’d do it with a man who made you feel uncomfortable, so the same rules apply.
My cousin brother is in love with a girl who often comes to our house. I have seen them close many times and once he noticed that I had accidentally entered the room. However, my cousin did not stop what he was doing with his girlfriend. She was unaware of my presence. I ran out of the room embarrassed and horrified at his attitude. It did not feel right. Have not met my cousin since that day. Does this situation amount to sexual abuse? I am not a minor though.
If you’re not a minor, behave like an adult. He should have locked the door, but it was a mistake for you to barge in like that without knocking. I assume you were there just a couple of seconds before turning around and walking out, so you wouldn’t know whether he stopped or not. If you were there staring longer than a few seconds, then you need to question yourself more than him. It’s childish to avoid the issue. Just message him saying you’re sorry you just barged in and that you hope he’s not feeling weird about it. Put a cute emoji and keep it light.
I am a 32-year-old man planning to move to the US soon, but my family wants me to get married before that. The girl I’ve been dating since a few months is much younger and isn’t really interested in labelling our relationship. I think I’m mentally ready to get married and waiting for things to work out is too exhausting. Is it the right time to go for the arranged route?
Marriage is not about the right time, it’s about the right person. You can always live in with someone if you’re looking for companionship. Marriage is too huge a commitment to make in a flash, especially if you’re embarking on a huge geographical shift. It’s your family who want you to marry in hurry, but it’s you who has to live with that human being for the rest of your life. Times have changed and divorces are common and unpleasant. It’s more mentally exhausting dealing with incompatibility and divorce rather than loneliness.

One year ago, he won a second successive victory, riding on the perception of decisive leadership on the issue of national security. Modi mistakenly interpreted the mandate as an endorsement of the controversial ideology of the Sangh Parivar.
He swiftly eliminated the special status of Jammu & Kashmir, and placed it under prolonged lockdown and detained pro-India political leaders. He pushed through the triple talaq bill to move law closer to a uniform civil code by criminalising a feature that enabled Muslim men to obtain divorces quickly. On the third ideological priority, the Supreme Court ruled that a Ram temple will be built at Ayodhya.
Next up was the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Its ostensible aim was to help non-Muslim minorities fleeing persecution in neighbouring countries, but home minister Amit Shah clarified the chronology: CAA would be followed by the updating of the National Register of Citizens. Thereafter, non-Muslims without proper proof of citizenship would acquire Indian citizenship through CAA. The remaining millions would be declared infiltrators and housed in detention camps indefinitely.
The unconstitutional introduction of a religious criterion for citizenship and the suspicion that this was a move to decitizenise Muslim Indians triggered sustained, spontaneous protests across India. In February communal riots broke out in northeast Delhi. Multiple videos surfaced showing how the Delhi Police (under central government control) failed to take action against rioters, at times abetted criminals and omitted to act against incendiary speeches by BJP leaders. While northeast Delhi burned, in Lutyens Delhi Modi partied with President Donald Trump.
Two weeks before Namaste Trump, Rahul Gandhi warned that urgent measures were required to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in India, but the government chose to ignore his warning. A month later, in the Rajya Sabha, I urged the government to adjourn Parliament early, but received the rejoinder that MPs needed to demonstrate bravery by working in the face of the Covid-19 threat.
Days after that, once BJP toppled the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, it abandoned the bravado and adjourned Parliament abruptly. After a practice session, the government imposed a national lockdown with four hours notice. The economy came to a sudden stop. Millions of migrant workers began their long march home braving nature, official apathy and police brutality. Tragically, some died along the way due to accidents or exhaustion.
The padayatra of the poor brought to centrestage the hitherto hidden misery of the masses. It revealed that the reality of rural India was that its able bodied would migrate in search of any insecure, even exploitative, chance to earn enough to survive and to send something home for the family. They had somehow missed Modi’s assurance that he was soon to double farmers’ incomes and that India was on the fast track to becoming a $5 trillion economy.
These inconvenient facts about the economy came as a surprise because the government has made sure that there is no data to decipher. When periodic labour surveys revealed rising unemployment, the government discontinued them. When the National Sample Survey warned of worsening poverty and malnutrition because rural Indians were cutting even their food expenditure, the government simply killed the survey citing technicalities.
The first year of Modi 2.0 also highlighted the steady erosion of a separation between the executive and the judiciary. The nomination of former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha days after he retired raised concerns about institutional capture. Indeed, the judiciary has somehow not found the time to intervene on crucial executive actions, including suspension of fundamental rights.
The government’s demonstrable lack of empathy for migrants trudging home contrasts with its earlier manic obsession with “infiltrators” who had to be rooted out through NRC. Clearly, if it had instead focussed on understanding why Indians moved around and in what conditions, it would have been able to create a support structure for migrant workers, and spared lakhs of them the pain and indignity they suffered during the lockdown.
In terms of the larger economy, if the government was willing to face facts, it would have seen evidence of a demand slump even before Covid-19 locked India down. Investments, electricity consumption, non-food credit, GDP growth, all were dropping steadily. Unfortunately, it still refuses to understand that without jump starting demand through substantial fiscal measures, all the credit measures it announced in the “world-beating” Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package will have little effect.
As India battles a global pandemic coupled with an economic crisis that has its roots in the Modi 1.0 government, it is clear that the next few months will shape the country’s future. At this critical time, all Indians need to be part of a collective effort directed towards recovery. Diverting even a single person’s energy towards an ideological agenda will contribute to dooming the country to a dismal fate.
India is at a crossroads. Modi can change course to restore India to its appropriate and inclusive growth path by focussing on repairing the economy, healing the pain of the poor, and dropping communally charged agendas. Or he can misinterpret the mandate as one for divisive leadership (communal tensions even reasserted themselves during the Covid-19 crisis).
History offers different models. Someone who wants to leave his mark on history can make his choices. For India’s sake, I hope he chooses wisely.

     Dear Rajeev Gowda.  HAve you ever heard of JAYACHAND who brought in Mohd Gori in to India? From that day, India has a constant supply of traitors who open the back door to kill the king inside. Afetr suffering 1000 years of slavery - looting, raping, murder, desecration, destruction, vandalism, use of Hindus as crocodile / tiger baits and assorted crimes, we still have traitors who write non-sense for 5 rupees. Do you know the solution for our economic problem? 100% scribes, 99% judges, 70% burecrats, 100% entertainer parasites all must be either asked to work with own hands and legs to produce food /shelter/ clothing/ other necessities for survival and if found unfit must be beheaded. YOU ARE unable to see that a nation having 40 c automobile owners has only 1.5 c tax payesr. You are unable to see 300 million people park their back from 10:00 to 17:30 and demand salary, pension, pay hike and increments but do no work at all.THE BIGGEST CRIME OF MONKEY BATH MAN: HE IS TOLERATING PARASITE TARITORS LIKE YOU INSTEAD OF EVICTING 300 M 5 RE CONVERTS AND ELIMINATING TRAITORS LIKE YOU...

Sure, the mother-in-law’s decision to suddenly turn ‘liberal’ may stem from her desire to win over her darling son, who has, on more than one occasion, shown his displeasure how unkindly his wife is treated in a household by elders yoked to ‘tradition’.
But at the end of the day, the fact that the daughter-in-law finds support from an unexpected quarter, which actually carries heft, should bring good cheer to those who find hidebound ‘domestic politics’ loathsome.
But what if instead of welcoming what is clearly beneficial, and empowering, for women largely treated as chattel, the mother-in-law’s decision becomes so suspcious and suspect – coming as it does from the mother-in-law — that a woman being supported for ‘being her own man’ suddenly becomes a rotten thing when seen from ‘liberal’ quarters?

This is pretty much what has happened with the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill that was opposed by a united Opposition in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. As soon as Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the Bill in the Upper House, a week after it was passed in the Lok Sabha unimpeded by parties including the Congress, all hell broke loose.
Suddenly, the BJP government stood exposed in everyone’s X-Ray glasses vision as trying to push forth a law that was deeply – and oh-so-conveniently – anti-Muslim.
So, what has been the incredible point of difference that has made the Congress oppose a Bill that it supported in the Lok Sabha just a week ago? It seems it is about ‘criminalising’ the breach of a ‘civil’ law. Talaq-e-biddat – instant triple talaq – according to those opposing the current Bill, should remain a civil offence — while dowry, domestic violence and bigamy are considered criminal, not uncivil.
The fact that there are many Muslim women who have opposed the anti-instant triple talaq decree hardly makes it legitimate. If that was so, the ‘traditional saas’ would have been the epitome of women’s rights, suddenly remembering the plight when saas bhi khabi bahu thi.
The problem, of course, lies elsewhere. It lies at the source of which entity is pushing for a law against (male) Muslims currently free – and actually utilise such freedom, however small their numbers may be – to divorce their wives by a trisyllabic statement.
Just because the colonial British ‘passed’ the Bengal Sati Regulation in 1829 that outlawed the self/coerced-immolation of Hindu widows (with pressure from reformists like Ram Mohan Roy et al), it did not make the practice ‘racist’, ‘communal’ or wrong. There were enough Hindu women who have been recorded in history to oppose the law. It still hardly makes the ‘regulation’, despite doused in politics advantageous to the colonial administration, wrong.
Of course, the BJP isn’t quite perceived as Lord Protector of Muslims. But like market forces, if electoral politics can push a government to criminalise a practice that would have perpetuated without it being made criminal, then more power to transformative electoral demand-supply politics.
Instant triple talaq, like ‘quiet domestic’ atrocities committed by Hindus, is a blight. It would have been great if a certified secular party like the Congress had brought about a law – not a select committee discussing the issue till the pigs come home – which criminalises people who divorce their spouses at a drop of a hat. They didn’t. Surely, the law seeking to criminalise it is not to blame.

     Muslims women must realize the hypocrisy of opposition for not allowing this bill to be passed. Congress, SP, shameless Mamata ( who herself is a woman ) are turning out to be anti-women.  Where is the secularism ?  It is a back stabbing process. Why cant these women come  onto  roads to expose these pseudo secular evil opposition ? Can they lead a morcha saying enough is enough  ?  First of all why the coward SC judges ( oh ya 3:2 verdict) left the matter on Parliament to decide ?? Why were those two idiot judges supporting 3T ?  Now these idiot oppositions are demanding a committee to complicate the matter.  Kick the selfish parties Congress, SP, TMC and  AIADMK, BSP, DMK, NCP, CPI, CPI(M), TDP, RJD, BJD, JMM, IUML for behaving like spoiled school children. The Muslim women should never vote these pseudo secular parties and kick that lady Mamata from Bengal for ever....  Read More

The government has announced that union Culture minister, Mahesh Sharma, will travel to the holy city on Tuesday to personally oversee and finalise a museum at the cost of Rs 225 crores. Though most would see it as another political ploy by BJP led NDA to garner votes before the crucial assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, the decision is belatedly welcome. Here are five reasons.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-76435"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ayodhya-1.jpg"" alt=""Ayodhya is situated on the banks of the river, Saryu."" width=""719"" height=""377"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ayodhya-1.jpg 719w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ayodhya-1-300x157.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"">Ayodhya is situated on the banks of the river, Saryu.
Firstly, ever since Babri demolition in 1993, locals have suffered at the hand of politicians and have been struggling to find gainful employment in the region. The last two decades have seen virtually no participation from industry in setting up factories forcing the new generation to migrate in search of jobs and opportunities. The museum will be able to mitigate the problem to a small extent, but importantly, it will be the stepping stone for boosting local economy over the next decade.

Secondly, the government has not just singled out Ayodhya for its religious importance earlier this year. Mega museums will be set up in Noida, Mathura and Gorakhpur also. The setting up of the proposed museum nearly 15 kilometres away from the disputed site will also ensure that there is no scope for any communal tension in the area. The government is assessing if it can host the International Ramayana Conference in Ayodhya this year. This will firmly showcase Ayodhya as a tourist destination that can host international events.

Thirdly, as per reports, Ayodhya has the largest footfall of domestic tourists in the state after Allahabad in the state. The ancient city on the banks of Saryu River has been registering over a crore tourists in the domestic circuit and the number rose to nearly 1.43 crore in 2014. Government patronage and creation of infrastructure can potentially take the number of foreign tourists visiting Ayodhya from 16,000 in 2014 to 50,000 in a few years.

Fourthly, the Ramayana Museum that will come up will be a part of tourism ministry’s Ramayana Circuit and will depict Rama’s journey of Rama. But this project will be executed by the state government which has already submitted its plan. The ruling Samajwadi Party has taken keen interest in reviving and renovating Hindu shrines and pilgrimages in Ayodhya, Mathura and Varanasi in order to boost tourism, a neglected sector in the state. Akhilesh Yadav led government has just approved the construction of an International theme park in Ayodhya.

Fifthly, irrespective of their faith, locals realise that boosting tourism is the only way forward for them to earn their livelihood. Two decades of strife has only resulted in bad blood and loss of income which was mainly due to devotees flocking to pay their respects to the birthplace of Rama. Just last month, the Hanumangarhi temple trust agreed to bear cost of reconstruction of Aalamgiri mosque and welcomed Muslims to offer namaz in their premises. This is the true reflection of Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb, and therefore the people here will welcome any move that can revive the past glory of this ancient land.

This is not the only such instance. From Mamata’s allowance for imams and muezzins to a minister in her government recently criticising the Supreme Court ban on triple talaq, there are several signs of the Trinamool administration pandering to one particular religious community. Perhaps this stems from Mamata’s recognition of Muslims as her party’s essential vote base. That base was earlier with the CPM. It is possible Mamata feels that she has to go out of her way for the minority community or it would migrate back to the Left.
That said, there are also worrying signs that BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar are trying to strengthen themselves in Bengal on the basis of the exclusionary Hindutva ideology. According to a report today, two Muslim youths suspected to be cattle smugglers were lynched by vigilantes in Bengal’s Jalpaiguri district on Sunday. This is the second case of cow-related lynching in the state in the last two months after three Muslim youths were beaten to death in June. That cow vigilantism has reached Bengal is indeed shocking and highlights the communal polarisation that is slowly brewing in the state.
If Mamata is guilty of Muslim appeasement, BJP and the Sangh are equally culpable for stoking radical sentiments on things like cow protection and illegal Bangladeshi migration. Let me make it clear that illegal smuggling of cows and illegal migration should be dealt with according to the law. But what appears to be happening is ground-level Hindu radicalisation that is leading to vigilantism. A sentiment is being spread that the Trinamool government will always side with Muslims, hence Hindus have to take matters into their own hands. This is extremely dangerous as it is creating fertile grounds for possible large-scale communal riots in Bengal.
And given Bengal’s sizeable Muslim population and history of communal violence, inter-religious riots in the state would be devastating. Both Mamata and BJP need to recognise this. Their politics of polarisation will burn down everything in Bengal. If she truly wants to project herself as a secular leader, Mamata must pull back from stunts that portray her as appeasing the Muslim community. Meanwhile, BJP should know that pressing the Hindutva line in Bengal can lead to catastrophic consequences. It would do well not to play politics with religion here.

     Bengal has had modest economic growth but enjoyed communal harmony since 1947. It would be a great pity if that is lost.

The feast day appears on 1st January in the liturgical calendar hence we celebrate the new year.
2019 has been a memorable journey for us as a Nation. Starting from Balakot Strikes to brave wing commander Abhinandan, From the second tenure of NDA government to demystifying Article 370 & 35 – A, Further from Triple talaq to Ayodhya verdict. Going beyond the borders from Mr. Trudeau being head of Canadian Cabinet to Mr. Johnson taking over as Britain’s prime minister for his decisive role in Brexit.
2020 [Twenty-Twenty] with a bonus day in February is going to be a remarkable year in terms of world history as 59th quadrennial US presidential elections are going to be held. Further, the most awaited Brexit deal between the EU and the British government to be concluded. The Greatest sporting showpiece in the world i.e. Tokyo Olympics is scheduled in mid-2020 and a lot more
We are already into the wee hours of the leap year. It is usually said, “Well begun is half done”. So let’s flip the calendar with few more resolutions. The most important aspect that needs to be addressed today is the economic slowdown which has already started hitting a common man. Every single organization has a vision and mission. Our county has the vision to be a developed nation and our mission is to be a 5 trillion economy by 2025 which can be achieved by the teamwork of 28 + 9 teams.
Despite the economic slowdown, India is still one of the fastest-growing economies around the globe. The world observes India as an asset for its plethora of consumer base which highlights our importance at economic and social grounds. Economic, Industrial and banking reforms are the need of the hour which are already a part of the government’s pipeline. Railway Revamp, Bank Mergers, CDS of all three forces are good signals for our nation. Being the citizens of this beautiful nation let us take a few more resolutions to be more responsible, more honest & most importantly more supportive citizens of our motherland India.

"1616953684-209","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","It is Freedom House that’s only ‘partly’ fair","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-headline/it-is-freedom-house-thats-only-partly-fair/","It is Freedom House that’s only ‘partly’ fair","March 8, 2021, 12:29 PM  IST","Rahul Shivshankar","A lazily applied label in the first paragraph of the Freedom House report gives its motives away. Under the section ‘Status Change’ the American think tank explains why India’s democratic status has declined from Free to Partly Free under the Modi regime. It cites a ‘’multiyear’’ pattern in which the ‘’…Hindu nationalist government and its allies have presided over rising political violence and discriminatory policies affecting the Muslims population…’’. Notice the label ‘’Hindu nationalist government’’.
By deploying this appellation the authors of the Freedom House report are admitting that they began their examination from the pre-conceived stand point that the Modi government is committed to the welfare of only one community – the Hindus.
Even the worst critics of the Modi regime would be hard pressed to establish that the NDA has drawn up policies to advantage one section of the Indian population exclusively over others. Unlike, for example, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh who gratuitously declared that Muslims must have the first right to India’s natural resources and then pushed the UPA into announcing schemes benefitting the community, the NDA has not mocked secularism.
Other organs of the state, Parliament and the Courts during Prime Minister Modi’s tenure have enacted and reinforced progressive social legislation. Instant triple talaq has been abolished, gay sex decriminalized, right to privacy fire-walled and women have been granted equal rights to pray in thus far male only places of worship. Even when state governments have enacted legislation impinging upon the private lives of two consenting adults the courts have been quick to restrain police who filed cases under the laws. In the not too distant past beleaguered citizens were often left disappointed by one or more institutions of the state. Surely, this is progress towards greater freedom?
It’s not just about the use of a loaded appellation. The Freedom House report is also based, by its own admission, on the opinions of ‘’observers’’ and ‘’external consultants’’. Did they trick Freedom House into concluding that the NDA has launched an assault on the political rights of Muslims through CAA and by selectively prosecuting them for the Delhi Riots? We will never know. But, had the authors of the Freedom House report cared to conduct a basic fact check they would have realized that the CAA law has nothing to do with Indian Muslims.
Drawing upon the civilizational principle of ‘’Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’’ (the world is one family) governments preceding the NDA had flagged the need for a law like the CAA to rescue minority citizens of Pakistan (and other Islamic nations) from zealots. If today, opposition parties have done a summersault on the CAA it says a lot more about their opportunism than the provisions of the law. It is indeed, mystifying that Freedom House has not only not taken this into consideration but has also overlooked that every year India welcomes thousands of Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This practice continues.
Second, police records available at the click of a mouse would have revealed to Freedom House that an almost equal number of Hindus and Muslims have been charged with crimes by the police in the context of the 2020 Delhi riots. Of late, there have been instances when the courts have also freed under trials rebuking the police for its over reach. How is any of this indicative of selective discrimination against Muslims?
A methodology relying on ‘’observers’’ and ‘’external sources’’ can never be sound. Who are these so-called ‘’observers’’? What are their antecedents? Can anyone at Freedom House attest to have filtered for bias the observations made by these external consultants? If so, is there any proof to show that this system of basic checks and balances exists?
Globally, Freedom House and its ratings are being called into question. One prominent researcher concludes that the ratings may look scientific but they’re actually subjective. In the 1970s, Freedom House rating reports were produced by one single social scientist called Raymond Gastil who himself later claimed that the reports were based on his ‘’hunches and intuitions’’. While a team of analysts and advisers have since taken over from Gastil the subjectivity in their reporting clearly lingers on.
Recently, an American publication called The National Review concluded that the once “bi-partisan’’ institution had taken a “strong partisan turn to the left” in examining nations led by conservative parties. To justify its findings the publication looked at the Freedom House report from 2018 on five free countries with conservative administrations – The United States, Israel, Great Britain, Poland and Denmark. The National Review observed a pronounced leftist bias in Freedom House rating scores while adjudicating on issues which traditionally divide societies: immigration, refugees, border security, criminal justice, gender equity and labour relations.
If in 2018 the Freedom House report exhibited bias against five nations is it a co-incidence that in its latest report the conservative NDA’s record on upholding freedoms has been rated poorly on more or less exactly the same parameters?
Unsurprisingly, in the face of mounting scrutiny and criticism Freedom House has taken to admitting an “element of unavoidable subjectivity” in its reporting. Given this, the Indian government need not have bothered with putting out a point-by-point rebuttal of speculative conclusions by Freedom House.

"1616953278-115","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/9/?s=triple+talaq","Law Commission lost the opportunity to leave behind a draft Uniform Civil Code","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/jibber-jabber/law-commission-lost-the-opportunity-to-leave-behind-a-draft-uniform-civil-code/","Law Commission lost the opportunity to leave behind a draft Uniform Civil Code","September 4, 2018, 12:23 PM  IST","Jiby J Kattakayam","The Law Commission of India has put out a 185-page consultation paper in its last days in office advising that the time is not ripe for an Uniform Civil Code. Admittedly, there are many progressive ideas in the paper. It has advocated amendments in existing laws to ensure justice within communities and creating a common framework for uniformity rather than obsessing on justice between communities. The BJP and “secular” opposition won’t mind this conclusion.
After all the Modi government is now focussed on uplifting Muslim women and this is frequently invoked in every speech by the Prime Minister. The triple talaq legislation and the ongoing SC hearings on nikah halala and polygamy are cited as proof of BJP’s concern for Muslim women. The Opposition, meanwhile, is rest content on its argument that UCC needs wider consultation. In these circumstances the Law Commission did the impossible in today’s fractious political environment: satisfy both sides of the divide.
But what about the citizen in the midst? How does achieving justice within communities work if the state is content with leaving citizens to whims of statutorily codified religious laws and personal religious laws? The least the Law Commission could have done is, within the limits of their capacity, come out with a model UCC draft which could have served as the starting point for something more concrete.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-108593"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UCC.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""495"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UCC.jpg 500w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UCC-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UCC-300x297.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"">
Existing statutes like the Special Marriage Act, Indian Succession Act, Guardians and Wards Act and Juvenile Justice Act could have been ridden of archaic provisions to give shape to this model draft. The bare minimum expected of a UCC is that it guarantees equal rights to all citizens without gender or religious or any form of discrimination and shouldn’t have been difficult to frame given that there are existing laws following the template and these laws are not hemmed in by religious traditions or religious treatises that arrive at different conclusions.
But one suspects that Indian society and India’s leading political parties or today’s crop of jurists are not read to face the wrath of conservative sections and their objections relating to religion and giving too much choice to individuals in matters of marriage, adoption, divorce or inheritance. At the end of the day, UCC is just a political slogan to slam the continuance of personal law among Muslims.
Even the Hindutva firmament that opposed the codification of Hindu laws in the 1940s and 50s may not be too keen on UCC, which would be truely secular and inclusive, taking citizens further away from the clutches of religion. Anyway, the Law Commission has lost a great opportunity to clear the cobwebs and it is now left to another panel, or even another government, to make a fresh start for a UCC.

"1616952911-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/14/?s=triple+talaq","What Coup in Pakistan?","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/serendipity/what-coup-in-pakistan/","What Coup in Pakistan?","January 14, 2012, 5:11 PM  IST","Rajiv Jayaram","Wags say that the judiciary and the military have colluded to form an alliance called the Pakistan Memo League to undemocratically oust yet another government in the country. According to them, the Memo League has pronounced the first two talaqs of the triple talaq against civilian authorities: the first was the memogate scandal that erupted in October last year, and the second the Supreme Court’s warning this week that it could disqualify both President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani for disobeying its orders in the National Reconciliation Ordinance case. The big question now is if the final talaq would culminate with the army action to uphold the sinister ‘doctrine of necessity’ of local jurisprudence. In other words, a military coup.
Shujaat Hussain, a seasoned politician and a puppet Prime Minister of former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf, once made a memorable one-liner about military coups in Pakistan — it takes just “two trucks and a jeep” to do so. An understatement, no doubt, but it speaks volumes about how easy it is to mount a coup in Islamabad. It is probably to remind this stark reality that the Pakistan Army suddenly changed the command of the 111 Brigade on Wednesday, in a move it called ‘routine posting’. This infantry brigade of Rawalpindi Corps is notorious for its fast response in organising coups. The posting came on the same day Prime Minister Gilani sacked defence secretary Lt-Gen (retd) Khalid Naeem Lodhi, considered close to the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, for “creating misunderstanding between the state institutions”.
 
But then, what sort of coup? There are two types of hard military coups. First, pure power grab. This is what happened in 1958 and 1977. In 1958, Command-in-Chief Gen Ayub Khan formed a clique with President Iskandar Mirza and on the latter’s “invitation”, anointed himself as chief martial law administrator, ostensibly to save democracy from bickering politicians. Soon after, Gen Ayub deposed Mirza and declared himself the President. In 1977, COAS Gen Ziaul Haq seized power just when the opposition Pakistan National Alliance, which was holding a protest movement against the allegedly rigged general elections, was about to sign an pact with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan Peoples Party to call off the agitation. The second is the provocation-triggered coup. In 1999, Gen Musharraf, while airborne from Sri Lanka to Pakistan, pulled off the coup on the ground in Islamabad because the provocation was grave: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had the temerity to sack the COAS and replace him with Gen Ziauddin Butt, a known Sharif family loyalist.
 
Then, there are two types of soft coups. The first is the ‘change of guard’, a palace coup of sorts. The only time this happened was in 1969, when Ayub, now self-promoted Field Marshal, handed over power to Gen Yahya Khan when it became politically untenable for him to call the shots. The second variety of soft coup is when the army chief seeks to prevent the ‘controlled’ democracy from challenging the military establishment’s supreme authority in the country’s foreign and defence policies as well as its vice-like grip in internal politics. There were many in the 1990s, but the outstanding example came in 1993, when COAS Gen Abdul Waheed Kakar mediated a raging personality clash between Nawaz Sharif (who was heading his first government then) and the establishment’s own man (and the Mian of Raiwind’s one-time benefactor) President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and made both to resign at virtual gun-point. Some call the five-month political tug-of-war and its denouement an unsurpassable thriller in Pakistan’s tryst with civilian governments.
 
In 2012, which one of these hard or soft scenarios will play itself out? For any COAS, powergrab is a sitter any time; yet, every army chief must let discretion better part of his valour. It is extremely unlikely that Gen Kayani will do it now, given its Abbottabad humiliation of May 2011 and much more important, how Gen Musharraf’s blotted the very name of military rule until 2008. Moreover, the Supreme Court and Nawaz Sharif’s party, the PML(N), won’t play ball. The ‘change of guard’ option is out of the question for obvious reasons.
 
That leaves two coup possibilities — the hard provocation-triggered and the soft remoulding of controlled democracy. Already, the army has reacted belligerently  to Prime Minister Gilani’s contention that Gen Kayani and ISI chief Lt-Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha had acted in an illegal manner in the memo scandal, saying these remarks could have “very serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences”. After sacking Lt-Gen Lodhi, if Prime Minister Gilani ratchet up escalation and remove Gen Kayani and Gen Pasha, then you can expect a full-scale army coup. Only if Prime Minister Gilani loses the plot completely.
 
The third talaq can take just one plausible turn and that is the tweaking of democracy and shuffling of civilian figureheads, with the Supreme Court’s generous help, to serve the army’s interests — from inside the present government, outside it or early general elections.

The BJP’s decision to touch home base by releasing a Hindutva-centric manifesto for UP suggests that the party’s intended positive plank centred on two biggest ‘achievements’ of the Modi regime — demonetisation and surgical strikes — has not taken off as expected. The missing rhetoric over demonetisation during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election speeches also points to his realisation that the issue is not playing out as centrally as expected. This implies that Modi doesn’t wish to raise the stakes further and run the risk of a possible defeat being painted by the Opposition as rejection of demonetisation, for this would queer the pitch for the rest of his tenure. The people also do not appear to be driven solely by desire to endorse or penalise the BJP for the contentious decision.
Clearly, pain and inconvenience caused in the wake of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes being scrapped has been neutralised significantly by people inferring that woes of the prosperous were greater. While Modi may have succeeded in getting people to acquiesce to his step, he failed to extract political dividends from the measure. The political objective of replacing the middle classes as the BJP’s core constituency with the masses has not been realised.
This offers lessons for those in government —programmes that do not positively impact the lives of people and merely target social and economic adversaries of the poor may elate people temporarily but doesn’t benefit electorally. Consequent to the political narrative not flowing in the direction it was expected to in UP, parties have fallen back on the old tactic of charismatic leaders propped by little but caste arithmetic. Naturally, this has muddled electoral waters greatly.
Other factors like track record of parties, promises and candidates’ background become secondary. ‘Jatiya Sameekaran’ (caste alignment), the phrase introduced in the post-Mandal electoral discourse, remains as essential an element as before.
Because of this the BJP has little option but to target the old bête noire of the Sangh Parivar — caste fissures in Hindu society which prevents its consolidation for electoral purposes. Founders of the RSS and Hindu nationalist ideologues like VD Savarkar campaigned for social reform in Hindu society, but it was not till the 1970s that programmatic thrust in this direction was imparted.
Yet, the Sangh Parivar failed to shed its pro-upper caste public image and it was only in the early 1990s that the BJP embarked on a conscious strategy to draw the OBCs into its fold. On the one hand, this was done by being socially inclusive while filling party positions and distributing tickets. But on the other hand, and more importantly, it united Hindus across castes by raking up majoritarian issues. Riots in Muzaffarnagar provided the opening for an unprecedented polarisation and this has been attempted in UP this time too.
The three-pronged revival of the Hindutva campaign — Ram temple, triple talaq and alleged ‘forced’ migration from Muslim dominated areas — is aimed at uniting Hindus across castes. The BJP will hope that polarisation, now appearing underway in western UP, will extend till the eastern extreme of the state — that votes last — and secure it a verdict similar to that in 2014.

Clearly, this change of tack has been necessitated by the poll pact between the SP and Congress which forges a formidable social and political coalition. Moreover, tactful marginalisation of the Shivpal Yadav faction in the party has enhanced chances of Akhilesh Yadav neutralising the anti-incumbent vote. The UP CM has also positioned himself as the local variant of ‘development man’ or Vikas Purush displaying wares — expressway, elevated corridors, metro, welfare schemes likes pensions and ambulances, women-specific programmes, schemes for youth — that Modi exhibited as chief minister in Gujarat.
Unlike Bihar that witnessed a bipolar contest, the battle in UP remains triangular with small pockets where it is even quadrangular.
Consequently, campaign strategy will keep evolving phase to phase as political and social factors keep altering. So far, the BJP has failed to dictate the framework of the polls and after the collapse of its positive platform, revival of the Hindutva bandwagon is possibly its last hope. But this too is easier said than done.

With everyone and their Jai Hinds mobilised — or, in the case of Karan Johar, understandably mortified — into proclaiming their love for their country from rooftops, inside cinemas, under sheets and over the top, let another litmus test of patriotism be quietly rolled out. This test can, inshallah, finally break the viper’s nest that has so far protected itself by having a’Secular’ sign nailed on its door.
In a sense, that test has already been operationalised US Navy Seals-in-Abbottabad-style. It comes in the form of a Law Commission questionnaire that wants to know what various “religious groups, social groups, minority groups, NGOs, political parties, civil society initiatives and government agencies” think about the possible implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC).
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-76609 size-full"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/UCC.gif"" width=""640"" height=""480"">The bangles tell it all
The UCC is a long-standing plan — in the mind of its detractors, a cunning plan, at that — by which personal laws based on religious practices and scriptures will get subsumed by the existing law of the land. These personal laws cover marriage, divorce, inheritance, maintenance procedures within communities whether conducted by religion-based bodies (All India Muslim Personal Law Board, AIMPLB) or non-religion-based ones (khap panchayats).
Nothing could be more secular than the UCC, a set of laws that apply and protect every Indian irrespective of their identity-marker. And yet, we’ve the strange spectacle of the ‘Left liberal’ being against it and the ‘Hindu right wing’ championing it. What on earth is going on in ‘indoostan? One of the abiding principles by which any debate on ‘secularism’ is largely conducted in this country is knee-jerkism. This is different from, and more insidious than, jerkism, that virulent business of reacting by shouting ‘Hindus are being discriminated against!’ each time Muslims get a discount on TV sets during Eid and by shouting ‘Muslims are being victimised!’ each time Hindus have fun on Dandiya nights.
The knee-jerkism against the UCC comes from two knees. One, the tradition of vote-bank politics that has political parties feeding these personal law lobbies and keeping them fat in return for votes.
Two, the UCC’s most vocal supporters want it for the wrongest of reasons. Mukul Kesavan in his Secular Common Sense points to how the demand of the common code is conflated with the notion of keeping the minorities in check. He mentions his meeting with an RSS functionary who wholly supports the ‘secular’ notion of the UCC so that Muslim polygamy, responsible in the man’s head for Muslims ‘soon’ overrunning, and running, the country is put to an end.
So when the AIMPLB states that “the Modi government is trying to sow the seeds of an internal war and hatred”, the government has to patiently argue its case bearing in mind its own reputation that precedes it in matters ‘secular’ and ‘communal’.
But bodies such as the AIMPLB and khaps can’t hide behind the skirt of ‘victimhood’ to perpetrate what are illegal acts ring-fenced by extreme moral relativism. One can’t, for instance, use the genuine history of enforced sterilisation during the Emergency to argue away the benefits of vasectomy. And one can’t certainly call vegetarianism evil just because Adolf Hitler stuck to his sauerkraut and potatoes.
The fact that the AIMPLB refuses to engage in a debate on the subject, having rejected the Law Commission questionnaire outright, is a blessing in disguise. It exposes itself — the Left’s rejection of the UCC doesn’t matter except in parlour games —for what it is: a bunch of people holding on to their ghetto power at the cost of their own people, overwhelmingly their women.
But it is important that the government — this government — is not seen conflating the UCC with a mission to only ‘save Muslims from Muslims’. On Monday, the wife of kabaddi player Rohit Chillar (a Jat Hindu) killed herself after being harassed by her husband and his family for dowry. Let the UCC also be highlighted as a scourge against dowry.
Not too long ago, Union minister for women and child development had said that the “international concept of marital rape” cannot be applied in India because of “a myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament”.
Well, let the same UCC that will deal with triple talaq and Muslim polygamy also deal with — and be seen dealing with — marital rape, relativism be damned.
This isn’t just about balancing Muslim injustice against women with Hindu injustice against women or [fill in your choice of community] injustice against women for politically correct symmetry. It’s about strategically pitching the UCC as a fumigant for the breaking of laws by all communities and religious groupings so as to get it practically implemented.
With everyone these days involved in the heady sport of competitive patriotism and all too ready to show that all Indians are utterly one in their love for India, this is the time to strike. If you don’t support the uniform civil code, you’re anti-national. Yes, I know it’s a sneaky way of going about something. But this uniform code is a good something, so…

"1616953644-199","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=triple+talaq","Modi government is applied Syama Prasad","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/indus-calling/modi-government-is-applied-syama-prasad/","Modi government is applied Syama Prasad","July 6, 2020, 9:17 AM  IST","Tarun Vijay","It was difficult to hold back tears going through the emotional comments of two Gorkha Bravehearts after getting their domicile certificates of Jammu and Kashmir. The story in TOI said- “Prem Bahadur can barely wipe his tears. The 68-year wait for this ex-serviceman of Gorkha ethnicity to become a J&K citizen is over. His jobless son Robin; a widow Lakshmi, whose husband served in artillery; 3rd gen army man Chaman and 3,500 such Gorkhas opt for J&K domicile.”
This couldn’t have happened if there was no Syama Prasad. The revolutionary changes brought by his two most ardent followers Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have changed the scenario from the exclusion of patriotic Indians from Kashmir to their inclusion and assimilation with the honour they deserve. Modi’s Atmnirbhar Bharat, strong replies to the terrorists and strikes on Pakistan, protecting India’s civilisational Hindu heritage with a vigour and clarity it deserves, protecting lives and honour of Hindus, Sikhs,Buddhists from Pakistan and Afghanistan, powering military and giving instant befitting replies to the China, and rejuvenating pride in using Indian languages in place of English – have a definitively Syama Peasad touch.
Article 370 gone. Two flag systems buried. 1948’s Hindu refugees from POK given citizenship and a grave injustice eliminated. Triple talaq gone. CAA done. Modi uses Tamil, Bangla , Hindi in his speeches, global discussions from Riyadh to Rio and Shanghai to London. From Kumbh to Kedarnath , Akshardham to Varanasi’s rejuvenation and Ganga Aarti, Hindu spiritualism and civisational heritage was never given such a prominence. It’s like a dream as things happened at such a rapid speed which none could have believed a few years before.
Post-Independence, no politician has impacted and directed the destiny of our nation as much as Syama Prasad Mookerjee. What Abraham Lincoln was to the new, rising America, Syama Prasad is to India. In a brief political career, spanning less than two decades, he became an epitome of struggles for protecting the honour and safety of the Hindus, India’s unification, and the battle against colonial and slave mindset. In 1953, he took up the cause of Jammu-Kashmir’s complete merger with the rest of the country, battled for it, led the nation from the front, and died for the cause. In 2019, sixty six years later when India’s Prime Minister and home minister roared in Parliament to announce that Articles 370 and 35A are buried forever and two new Union territories have been created, namely Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, it was the day and the moment when Syama Prasad Mookerjee was resurrected.
A great warrior to the core, a born democrat, he chose the path of constitutionalism against the forces of the dark ages, the evil empire of the Jinnahs and the Abdullas, who threatened openly to take up the violent path. Syama Prasad finally trounced them with the power of truth and the colours of his sacrifice.
I describe Dr Syama Prasad in my book, “The Warrior Democrat” (being presented to PM Modi on July 6) as The Lion who would rewrite the destiny of India. He was a pure-hearted academician who wrote – “My tendencies lay in the shape of educational administration and I did not feel attracted by the noisy and dusty career of a politician. I thought the best way to serve my country would be through the path of Education.” But destiny had other things marked for him.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee was an academician, statesman, and a political thinker who redefined nationalism and took up the cause of the persecuted Hindus. He encouraged science education and was a pioneer who went on to become the president of the Mahabodhi Society, Bodhgaya, one of the highest seats of Buddhism in the world. His lasting impact on the political map of India was to remove the hurdles in the way of the final and irrevocable merger of Jammu and Kashmir state with the Indian union and his sacrifice is still shrouded in mystery as many of his party leaders described it as a political killing. Sadly, a probe was never ordered.
As it happens with most political stalwarts, their multifaceted life gets overwhelmed by a few more pronounced political events and the other aspects of their life remain lesser known even though those aspects would have thrown a better light on the principal personae of the leader.
Syama Prasad is just “Kashmir struggle” for most of the political watchers. My book is an effort to present a wholesome, the real Syama Prasad, a family man, a scholar par excellence, a person who was highly sensitive towards the poor and the downtrodden and the propounder of a scientific mindset amongst the youth.
He delivered more than twenty convocation addresses across the country, including Universites of Calcutta, Delhi, Agra, Benares, Mysore and Patna. He was a journalist, an editor and he founded the Nationalist news magazine. His spiritualism took him closer to Sri Aurobindo and he was designated the first vice-chancellor of the Sri Aurobindo University, Pondicherry by the Mother. His compassion and love to help is legendary and the letter of Kazi Nazrul Islam, who went on to become the national poet of Bangladesh, is a testimony to this fact. When all his Muim friends ditched, it was Syama Prasad who came to his help . He was first vice chancellor to begin convocation addresses delivered in Indian languages and the initiative began with Kaviguru Ravindranath Thakur delivering it in Bengali at Syama Prasad’s invitation. That too, was boycotted by Muslim extremist students in Calcutta university to oppose a lotus in university’s insignia as they said “Lotus” is a Hindu symbol unacceptable to us.
He was a firebrand orator, a nationally-reputed unapologetic Hindu leader, a favourite of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and he was also the choice of Mahatma Gandhi to be inducted in independent India’s first Cabinet under Nehru and became India’s first industry minister.
After his resignation from the Cabinet on Nehru-Liaqat pact, he was the first choice of RSS Sarsanghchalak (Chief) MS Golwalkar to be nominated as the first president of Bharatiya Janasangh, the party that in its new avatar as Bharartiya Janata party is ruling India today.
His contribution and resolve to ensure a complete and an inalienable merger of Jammu & Kashmir with the Indian union, had been guiding and powering innumerable movements, struggle, and political battles both inside Parliament and outside since the last six decades. Finally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah did what was considered by many as impossible – by abrogating Constitution’s most controversial clause 370 and 35A, separating J&K from Ladakh and turning both Union territories. Both the leaders dedicated the historic decision to Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee.
That’s Syama Prasad in brief. Incredible Indian statesman, who still remains the prime inspiration to the millions of workers of the nationalist hue whether they are in the BJP, in RSS or in any other organization.
Before the infamous Calcutta massacre of the Hindus at the instigation of Jinnah, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee had said in a statement that Jinnah is out to destroy the very soul of India.
The Direct Action of the Muslim League was a last straw in the creation of Pakistan.
On the massacre of Hindus, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who was first elected to Bengal legislature on a Congress ticket, wrote, “What happened in Calcutta is perhaps without a parallel in modern history. St. Bartholomew’s Day, of which history records some grim events of murder and butchery, pales into insignificance compared to the brutalities that were committed in the streets, lanes and by-lanes of this first city of British India.”
Syama Prasad was an ardent devotee of Sri Aurobindo and hence had unflinching faith in the necessity of a united India. He said, “the dangers in front of us are many; the latest addition in the shape of a movement for Pakistan should not be lightly brushed aside. This preposterous claim must be nipped in the bud by all lovers of Hindusthan.”(Sylhet, 7th April 1940).
The Congress remained a silent spectator to the plight of the Hindus. Mookerjee wrote, “Much though we wish that the truth was otherwise, it is no use concealing the fact that the Congress has not succeeded in bringing within its fold any very large number of Moslems. And yet the Congress dare not openly fight for the protection of Hindu interests even though they are deliberately trampled underfoot.”(ibid).
Lastly, Congress’s surrender to Jinnah left no choice before the nationalists and Mookerjee supported the partition of Bengal in 1946 as a fait accompli only to prevent the inclusion of its Hindu-majority areas in a Muslim-dominated East Pakistan (If 25% of Muslims could not agree to live in India, how could 44% of Hindus live in Bengal under 54% Muslims?”). He also opposed a failed bid for a united but independent Bengal made in 1947 by Sarat Bose, the brother of Subhas Chandra Bose and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, a Bengali Muslim politician.
After a partitioned India got Independence, Syama Prasad developed some differences with the Hindu Mahasabha and severed his relations with it on the issue of allowing all Indians to the party and let the Mahasabha become a social platform to take up the cause of the Hindus.
At the insistence of Mahatma Gandhi, Syama Prasad was inducted in the first Cabinet of Independent India and Nehru gave him the industry portfolio – which he handled with great finesse and capability. He replaced all European officers in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd with capable Indians, curtailed wasteful expenses and gave a fillip to the industrialization of a new free India. It needs an entirely separate chapter to describe how meticulously Syama Prasad laid the foundation of India’s industrialization through steel, fertilizer factories and local entrepreneurship.
If today Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving a call to be ‘Atmnirbhar’ and be ‘vocal about local’, the inspiration is certainly the thoughts of Syama Prasad who wanted a self-reliant industrially powerful nation.
Meanwhile, the plight of Hindu refugees coming from western and eastern Pakistan was sending shock waves across the country and Syama Prasad was very uncomfortable to see that the Congress was totally insensitive to their cries. In Bengal, it was worse. Like Punjab, there was no exchange of population and property between Hindus and Muslims of Bengal. Syama Parsad felt it is criminal that while the Hindus are suffering and none are coming forward to help them, he remains in the Cabinet and enjoys the fruits of power.
Between January to April 1950, more than a million Hindus, belonging to all classes took shelter in Bengal and a section of them also moved to other regions. He remembered having assured Hindus of east Bengal that after the partition, their lives and properties would be protected but saw that it was not happening. He cautioned Nehru many times but felt that Nehru was in no mood to alleviate the sufferings of the Hindus and on the contrary he was going to sign a pact in April with Liaquat Ali, the notoriously anti-Hindu Prime Minister of Pakistan, who was heavily prejudiced against the Hindus.
Already serious differences had cropped up between Syama Prasad and Nehru. In 1947, Pakistan attacked Kashmir, in the garb of tribal intruders, grabbed a large part of the territory including Gilgit- Baltistan. Nehru took the Kashmir issue to the United Nations and was seen being guided by a rabidly communal and anti-India Sheikh Abdullah with a strong disdain for the erstwhile Maharaja of Kashmir .
Seeing such a situation Syama Prasad decided he couldn’t be part of a government that had miserably failed to protect the Hindus.
Syama Prasad was already in touch with the RSS. He had met its founder in Kolkata as early as 1930s and had appreciated the organisation’s work saying RSS constituted “the only silver lining in the cloudy sky of India”.
The then Sarsanghchalak, (Chief) of the RSS Shri M.S. Golwalkar (Shri Guruji) was deeply impressed with the dedication to the cause of the Hindus shown by Syama Prasad and his brilliance. When Dr Syama Prasad met him after his resignation, Golwakar discussed the possibility of forming a new political party to voice the pains and sufferings of the millions of nationalists, which was being ignored by a ‘secular’ Congress under its Muslim appeasement policy. Thus, was born the Bharatiya Jana Sangh under the presidentship of Syama Prasad in October 1951. Thousands of RSS workers joined to help the new party that had stalwarts like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Balraj Madhok as his new colleagues to assist him spread the wings of the new organization all over India.
The charisma and popularity of Syama Prasad made Jan Sangh campaign in 1952 elections so strong that almost in every public meeting Nehru used to abuse Jan Sangh – a nascent party and its leader Syama Prasad.
Jan Sangh won three seats in Lok Sabha with Syama Prasad winning from the South Calcutta seat. Such strong was the personality and the power of his thoughts, that in spite of being the smallest party in Parliament, Syama Prasad succeeded in organizing the entire opposition consisting of Akali Dal, Hindu Mahasabha, Ganatantra Parishad, etc., into one single parliamentary bloc of opposition called the United National Party with Syama Prasad as its leader in the House.
Syama Prasad was the Lion of Parliament. Nehru feared him. When Syama Prasad decided to lead the Kashmir movement from the front there were apprehensions for his life, which unfortunately came true. His mysterious death in Shaikh Abdullah’s jail in Srinagar was termed a conspiracy and a political murder by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Syama Prasad’s 82-year-old mother Smt Jogmaya Devi wrote to Nehru, who never replied to her letter. The letter must be read by all who say Nehru was a liberal. In fact, Nehru was the most intolerant PM India has ever had. These lines of Jogmaya Devi should shake any sensitive government’s soul. She said – ‘I hold the Kashmir Govt responsible for the death of my son. I accuse your Govt of complicity in the matter’.
If several probes can be ordered to investigate the mystery around Netaji Subhash Bose’s final days, it’s about time to institute a thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to Syama Prasad’s death.
The giant who created a path of unity and nationalism still lives through his millions of disciples like Modi and Shah who have realized his dreams in less than seven decades of his martyrdom.

     It is not just Kashmir. Several states in the north east have similar restrictions on people from other states settling down, buying property. My personal view is that Indian citizens should have the right to settle in any part of the country, enrich it with their talent, enterprise and hard work. Also that, over time, this would contribute to faster economic development of those parts of the country that prize their exclusivity. However, there should be no compulsion. Almost by definition, anything that adds to a feeling of alienation and angst in the Valley is not good for India....  Read More

Don’t make it a byword for Parliament","July 17, 2018, 7:03 PM  IST","TOI Edit","Parliament’s monsoon session offers both government and opposition one more opportunity to rise above the din and haze of polarised politics and present some cognitive clarity on major issues facing the country. General elections are still months away but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already given the impression he is in campaign mode with visits to Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Rajasthan. Ever since enacting GST last year, government has not displayed the same urgency on its other pending legislative agenda. Even the opposition, despite being offered controversies on a platter like demonetisation or Nirav Modi’s escape, has underperformed in Parliament.
The washout of the winter and budget sessions is not helping either side. When presiding officers reject opposition demands, their MPs have chosen the ineffective and dangerous strategy of disrupting house business to make their point. Ruling MPs have been no less provocative. Replacing debate with sloganeering is damaging Parliament’s credibility.
Budget session saw disruptions by Congress on Nirav Modi, by TDP and YSRCP on Andhra special status, by TRS on removing 50% cap on reservations, and AIADMK-DMK on Cauvery. Thanks to the cacophony government succeeded in postponing the no-confidence motion. The opportunity to test opposition unity and corner government on lynchings, farm distress, exorbitant fuel taxes and the banking crisis has presented itself again. With unity efforts gaining pace in the states, the monsoon session will test the ability of opposition parties to collaborate in Delhi. As Congress is in no position to challenge the BJP juggernaut singlehandedly, it will need to coordinate with other opposition leaders.
BJP must address charges that it has diverted focus to issues peripheral to governance. Government must explain to Parliament the challenges posed by the US-China trade war and trade pressures that are building up, and what it is doing to shore up India’s economic competitiveness in this unfavourable environment. Amendments to Prevention of Corruption Act and Bankruptcy Code and the bill to confiscate properties of absconding economic offenders can help government show it means business. Some pending bills, such as criminalising triple talaq and instituting death penalty for rape of minor girls, are tokenist and counterproductive; they ought to be shot down. The Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson’s post has fallen vacant this session. BJP must soothe misgivings of its NDA partners while opposition must settle confusions over a consensus candidate. Engagement, not disruption, must be Parliament’s mantra.

     Why is criminalizing Triple Talaq counterproductive?

"1616953245-109","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/10/?s=triple+talaq","Female Genital Mutilation: A millennial crime","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/arise-awake-and-stop-not/female-genital-mutilation-a-millennial-crime/","Female Genital Mutilation: A millennial crime","July 19, 2018, 4:54 PM  IST","Lalita Nijhawan","It is commonplace knowledge that Islam preaches circumcision, a form of male genital mutilation as a tenet and a sacrament of Islamic practices however little do people know about the equally practiced female genital mutilation.
Under the garb of sacrosanct religious diktats, the Dawoodi Bohra community is obstinate to continue the sublime horror of FGM (Female Genital mutilation) The Bohra high priest vehemently favours this custom, rendering religious justification for its continuation.
While in the West, actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Jennifer Lawrence, Uma Thurman have actively engaged in the campaign ‘Me too’ A movement against sexual harassment and assault.
India is rather taking a snail’s pace in the domain. However, Actress Nusrat Bharucha (Pyar ka panchnama actress) who belongs to the Bohra community and whose mother had undergone FGM has filed a petition and speaks vociferously against the custom.
Also known as ‘Haraam ki boti’ in native parlance, it translates to ‘the source of sin’ thereby validating the removal of ‘unwanted skin’.

It is believed that partial or total removal of the external female genitalia will enable individual hygiene, coupled with societal stabilization through controlled female sexual act.
Clitoral mutilation is carried out in these communities, between infancy and adolescence. But the more odious part is that it is carried out by untrained midwives and self-proclaimed experts from amongst the elders in the community.
The usage of instruments such as common knives and blades point out to medical apathy. Looming large over dismal medical procedure is the aftermath of extreme pain, continual bleeding and infections, probable cyst formation, sexual disorders. And it doesn’t stop at that, in severe cases it could lead to childbirth complications, worst comes to worst, even death.
It is presumed to take away excessive libido, prevent unpleasant odor, and ironically reduce urinary infection. However there are no medical records to ascertain this claim, much to the contrary, World Health Organization (WHO) along with United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) issued a joint statement against the FGM in 1997.
In December 2012, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) came up with a resolution to eliminate FGM from the world. It has designated 6th February as the international day for Zero tolerance for FGM.
The sentiment is echoed by United Nations Convention on the Rights of the child (UNCRC) and the UN universal declaration of human rights, of which India is a signatory.
In the international arena, FGM is practiced in places such as Africa, South America and the Middle East. In the present day it has been banned in as far as 27 African countries, America, England, France and the general fervor seems to grow.
Closer home, a PIL has been filed, intervention applications are sprouting in the Supreme Court.
Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has taken cognizance of the clandestine act and regarded it to be a violation of the bodily integrity of the girl child. It was pointed out, why should anyone have the authority to access a girl’s private part, even if it is in the name of faith.
When the SC ascertained its stand, deeming it unacceptable, Congress politician and lawyer for the Bohra community, Abhishek Manu Singhvi claimed that the practice is a thousand year old custom, adding on he said that since only a small section of the foreskin is removed, women do not face any complications and it is not any different from male circumcision. He backed the argument with the Right to religious freedom under article 25 as a basic fundamental right.
Central government’s attorney general K. K. Venugopal threw light upon the difference in FGM and MGM stating as a matter of fact that while the MGM may have benefits however the FGM must be out and out banned, not only is it futile, in most cases it leads to further irreversible complications.
Early in 2016, about 50 FGM survivors launched a month-long campaign in Mumbai ‘Each one reach one’ where experiences and accounts of unfortunate victims are shared on the online portal by women across the world.
A number of women have come forward to show their displeasure and cry out against the nefarious act.
Since most of the victims are minors due to the age frame within which the act is conducted, it is also a violation of the POCSO act.
Earlier this year in February came out the first qualitative study on FGM titled ‘The clitoralhood – a contested sight’ released by Masooma Ranalvi whose network ‘We Speak Out’ is the largest survivor-led movement to end female circumcision.
Statistics that stand testimony to the abhorrent practice revealed that near about 75% of all daughters of the study sample were subjected to FGM, 97% remembered the pain inflicted on them, 33% categorically pointed out that the painful memory remained with them much after they grew up.
As there are 2 sides to one coin, so there exists a fraction of women in the community The Dawoodi Bohra Women’s association which is crying foul against the elimination of the practice.
It is noteworthy however that some women of the community have joined hands in fighting against Triple Talaq, Nikah halala, Polygamy, FGM. But the apathy of politicization of atrocities is a matter of concern. Orthodox members of the Muslim community have made it their manifesto to keep every wrong act alive. And those vouching for Muslim votes are favoring even these wrongs.
The SC verdict is eagerly awaited; however a greater challenge than the SC verdict is societal acceptance.
In order to see real changes manifest in the society, it is the people’s understanding of human rights, scientific hygiene standards and adjustment of moral compass that need to take the front seat. And bigger than that is the victims’ bravery for they alone have to fight out against the atrocities they are subjected to. They alone need to recognize their rights and fight for them.

With the Bill facing tough questions in Rajya Sabha, government has chosen to push through its own version rather than grapple with opposition’s amendments. The bypassing of Parliament is unfortunate.
The maximum duration of six months the ordinance will be in effect gives BJP ample time to campaign on this legislative ‘achievement’, despite the uncertainty of winning Parliament approval. But laws cannot be solely about scoring brownie points. It must have clarity and meet the purpose it is designed to serve. By allowing only the wife or a close relative to be the complainant, and making allowance for bail the scope for misuse is reduced.
Read: Why triple talaq ordinance is better for politics than a bill
But there is a fundamental weakness in the ordinance that could manifest when matters come to court and the wife must prove that talaq has been said to her, in the absence of witnesses or documentary evidence. It becomes a case of one person’s word against another’s rendering criminal trials inconclusive, often with the victim securing no redress. Activists have suggested that triple talaq be treated on par with domestic violence attracting the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), which primarily offers civil recourse and constant monitoring by the state.

PWDVA ropes in District Protection Officers to issue regular protection orders and represent aggrieved women in court besides allowing magistrates to offer monetary relief. Considering that talaq is essentially divorce performed illegally, PWDVA provisions lend themselves adequately to providing interim relief to women, ensuring their safety, and assuring them of support from civil administration. In contrast, the rough edges of criminal law wielded against family discord may only worsen the situation, especially for children in the marriage. In the rush to criminalise, government appears to have closed out the other options available before it.

The amendments, according to reports, expand the list of those responsible for looking after aged family members. Now not just biological children, but also sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, adoptive and stepchildren will be liable. Official caregivers who fail to comply can face a jail term of up to six months, against the current maximum of three months, if these amendments become law.

As ordinary citizens, we don’t spend much time reading about and thinking through the creation of new laws or amendments of old ones. We forget that the main constitutional responsibility of the MLAs and MPs that we vote for is law making, and oversight of the executive to implement those laws. During my husband’s 2014 election campaign, I did not hear a single voter mention this aspect of the legislator’s role. Most were concerned with local issues, which they felt helpless to address, and expected the MLA and MP to personally deliver on.
Yet, it is good laws that make for the good, functional society that most voters crave. Good laws are fair, do not discriminate against any group and are reasonably implementable. These create the very bedrock, on which samaaj, sarkaar and bazaar can maintain co-operation and peace; be more productive and reach for higher goals.
Bad laws, on the other hand, can harass and persecute innocent people; put the burden of proof on the citizen instead of on the accuser or the state; give excessive punishment; and create an atmosphere of fear. They also create opportunities for rent seeking and corruption by putting excessive discriminatory power into the hands of enforcing authorities.
Once in a while, as in the Nirbhaya case, the broader middle classes get agitated and rightfully express rage and helplessness. This creates the environment for passing newer, harsher laws or amendments for terrible crimes.
Unfortunately, there is little evidence that more severe punishment in the law acts as enough deterrence for future similar crimes. Recent events in Unnao and Hyderabad require us to pause and think, even as we grieve.
Societies have debated the severity of punishment for vile acts over millennia, with complex moral arguments on both sides of the question.
But citizens and society should pay more attention to the trend of over-criminalisation of common human failings and frailties. Some laws have moved issues from the civil to the criminal domain with severe penalties and jail sentences for non-compliance. This is by no means new. But recent Parliament sessions have been more productive than ever in terms of both attendance and legislation, though there has been very little substantive discussion on the Bills. And this has led to even more policies, bills and laws that fall into this category.
Let’s take a few examples, in addition to the proposed amendment on parent welfare.
The Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019 proposes up to 10 years in jail for possession and trading in cryptocurrency. Recent amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act include prison terms for certain violations, such as driving an uninsured vehicle. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, declares triple talaq a criminal offence, punishable with 3 years’ imprisonment. The Union government recently banned e-cigarettes and now, even just the storage of them can merit a jail term of up to six months for the very first offence. Offences on a private member’s bill to prohibit Paan and Gutka similarly proposed a criminal liability of 10 years’ imprisonment. The Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, introduces greater scope for GST officers to arrest tax evaders and offences are non-bailable if the amount involved exceeds Rs 5 crore.
A similar attempt at criminalisation was made for non-compliance of the obligations for Corporate Social Responsibility. Every officer of the company in default could face imprisonment for up to 3 years. That received such a reaction from powerful corporate lobbies that it was withdrawn in a hurry. But not every policy or law has an affected constituency with such a direct line to the government as business does.
These are just some examples of a creeping trend that should worry us all. Criminal law may be quite unsuited to address many societal issues. Some of them are about inter-personal obligations and duties, such as the very basic duty to look after your own parents who gave you life. Others affect individuals and create private wrongs and may not require a public law remedy, or may have already a civil law remedy.
Equally importantly, if ‘justice delayed is justice denied’, we have to think of the implication of more and more offences that lead to more and more imprisonment. It takes up tremendous resources of the state. Our prison system is already over crowded, with absolutely inhuman conditions. A majority of prisoners are under-trials, which means that their guilt has not yet been proven. None of us would like to be imprisoned without a just verdict.
Maybe it is time to reflect and reimagine what issues belong to samaaj to address, however slowly and painfully, and which must fall to the state or sarkaar to uphold. Meanwhile, let’s communicate strongly to our legislators. Let’s hold lawmakers accountable to draft, to pass and to uphold good laws that work for citizens and not against them.

"1616953091-71","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/11/?s=triple+talaq","What Supreme Court and AIMPLB obviously have in common: Male dominance","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/twinkle-twinkle/what-supreme-court-and-aimplb-obviously-have-in-common-male-dominance/","What Supreme Court and AIMPLB obviously have in common: Male dominance","August 24, 2017, 7:24 PM  IST","Renuka Bisht","After its long campaign for non-interference in Muslim personal law, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is in a quandary now. It will meet in Bhopal on September 10 to formalize future strategy, in response to the Supreme Court striking down instant triple talaq as violative of the fundamental right to equality.
This is amidst mounting criticism of its failure to take the leadership on reforming the Muslim community from within. It doesn’t help that the representation of women in the 301-member board is less than 8%. Actually women may have even lesser strength in the executive panel of the board. AIMPLB women members who took a position against triple talaq were reportedly sidelined or shown the door by the male-dominated religious body.
Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which was one of the six petitioners along with the valiant Shayara Bano, is convinced that AIMPLB itself will grow more sidelined as women become more informed and determined: “We don’t trust them. They have been denying rights granted by the Quran and the Constitution to the Muslim women. If it was indeed relevant, women would not have felt the need to move court.”
If women had had greater representation on the AIMPLB board, it would have been more responsive to their concerns. This is a simple enough logic, and interestingly enough it applies as much to the Supreme Court that has put AIMPLB in such a quandary. Not only is only one of the 27 apex court judges today a woman, it has had a grand total of SIX women judges since Independence. The high courts boast 10% women judges, which is quite similar to the 8% women membership of AIMPLB!
Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit in setting aside talaq-e-biddat concluded, “This form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it … It being manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of discrimination.”
On the TOI edit page today Arghya Sengupta draws attention to this strange hesitation of five male judges of the Supreme Court on a matter critical to the lives of women in India: “It is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women.”
A lady on the bench you can bet would have delved into discrimination.

MRM says it derives inspiration from RSS, though is not formally linked to it:

What is your opinion on triple talaq?
Triple talaq is correct but instant triple talaq, which is called Talaq-i-Bid’ah, is the biggest sin in Islam. In the era of Hazrat Umar, a man giving such divorce was punished with 50 lashes. Today, the practice continues but lashes have disappeared. It has become a social disaster. In every three houses, there is at least one divorce. It is even worse in villages.
We as a community should think about it. Ulemas should think about it and AIMPLB should also look in the direction of reform. Even if you want to make it legal then have provisions like giving half the property and savings of the husband to the woman. Moreover, except for two sects of Muslims, others don’t accept this kind of talaq. Are they not Muslim?
Do you agree with the Union government’s stand that ending triple talaq is about gender justice and should not be linked to UCC and Islam in general?
I totally agree. If you link triple talaq to Islam then a thief should lose a hand, a rapist should be half buried in ground and stoned to death, and a murderer should be beheaded publicly in market place. But even when you don’t follow these rules anymore, you remain a Muslim. So, this is not about Islam.
Is it now a debate between progressive and regressive elements within Islam?
Reforms are a continuous process. Most importantly, it is not a ‘mazhabi arkan’ (one of the basic duties defining a Muslim). Even if you don’t follow duties like observing fasts or five prayers a day rigorously, you don’t cease to be a Muslim. Clearly, it’s just a social custom. Sects like Shias, Bohra, Ahle Aziz don’t follow triple talaq.
Your everyday Muslim is not uneducated or ignorant today. For six months the issue has been in news, tell me how many agitations have taken place so far? How many ulemas have come out on the streets? So the society also wants change and AIMPLB is the biggest hurdle in this.
The AIMPLB affidavit in the apex court seemed to suggest that men are superior to women and polygamy is good for society. Your views?
Women have equal rights. In Islam they also have right to divorce which is called khula. I agree that its procedure is difficult but the norm exists. When i said there should be no instant triple talaq, people from my community started saying that i’m not a Muslim. But can you decide if i am a Muslim or not? Only i decide that.
Are you comfortable with the timing of the survey that the Law Commission has put on its website and with the questionnaire?
A Muslim woman lives under constant fear and shadow of danger of being rendered homeless suddenly. AIMPLB people are going to mosques and asking for a referendum on the issue. But it’s not a men’s issue. Most men would say they want it. The Law Commission should go to villages. Those who need to answer this question don’t even know what a website is. Let them do a sample survey like a poll, which covers people from all sects and sections and genders. Both AIMPLB and the law panel should do a referendum involving only women. The other half of the population needs to be heard.
What are your views on UCC?
There are a lot of misapprehensions. When i talk to a normal person in my community about UCC, you know what they say? “They won’t even let us bury our dead, they would force us to burn them. They won’t let us say namaz.” Even those members of AIMPLB who don’t agree with instant triple talaq, like Bohras and Shias, are not speaking against it. This is because they are being told that this is a way to push the UCC. The government should first of all do away with misconceptions.
Are you afraid that if Supreme Court bans triple talaq, there could be an outcry similar to what happened after Shah Bano case?
There will be some impact but nothing like what happened back then. In Hindus, there were customs like sati and child marriages but laws were made. Hindus reformed their society, their systems. There is a constant need to reform.

In a fourth case, in Maharashtra, the State accused a highly respected High Court judge of bias and demanded that a case be removed from his bench. The Chief Justice did it. But the bar associations and public opinion forced that decision to be revoked. And the Government had to eat its words. But first, the judgments.
The first judgment came on Tuesday. When it set aside the practice of instant triple talaq saying it violated Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, everyone was thrilled. Muslim women finally regained their dignity. Instant triple talaq was always known to be a bad idea and even the Muslims knew it. Most men were embarrassed about it. Women hated it. But since the maulvis claimed (incorrectly, as we suspected all along) that it was an intrinsic part of the faith not many

were eager to challenge it. Emboldened by this, some took advantage of it. So you had husbands divorcing wives through speed post, sms, emails, and even over Skype and WhatsApp– and then disappearing or remarrying. The divorced wife got nothing—apart from social opprobrium.
Slowly the victims gathered the courage to fight back. It helped that many Muslim majority nations across the world (including our neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh) have abolished the practice. It also helped that informed Muslims pointed out that nowhere in the Koran is instant triple talaq ever mentioned as a way divorce ought to be conducted; nor is it recommended as a religious practice apt for good Muslims. A women’s group and a few victims, mostly poor and unsupported, finally reached the courts and, to everyone’s surprise, it went all the way up to the Supreme Court and won a verdict that has the overwhelming support of women all over India—and no, it did not offend the Muslim community at large.
Stopping instant triple talaq, everyone felt, was a step in the right direction. As indeed banning  sati was in 1829. The next judgment came on Wednesday. It was even more important because it involved not just women of one community. It involved us all. A nine member Supreme Court bench, in its infinite wisdom, restored to every Indian the right to privacy– as a fundamental right intrinsic to

our life and liberty enshrined in Article 21 and all the Government’s men and their fancy arguments could not persuade a single judge among those nine to see it otherwise. Many have called it one of the finest judgments ever, where the case for privacy has been brilliantly argued and upheld.
70 years after Independence, when our privacy was under the biggest threat, the court reaffirmed that whatever excuse the government may offer, they cannot impinge upon our private space.
We cannot have mobs invade our homes, raid our larders, lynch people. In fact, the State should not be deciding what we eat, what we read, the language we speak, what we watch in the movies, what we wear to school or college, how we worship, who we fall in love with, who we marry.
Hopefully, some recent decisions will now come under scrutiny and the Orwellian world being built around the premise of the Aadhar card, the Nandan Nilekani authored script for mass surveillance, will be subjected to review.
The third judgment was on Friday. By a CBI court that sent a hairy and rapacious self styled godman with close links to the regime to jail on the charge of raping two of his female devotees.
The courage of those women who pursued justice in the face of intimidation and the grit of a local journalist who was later murdered for breaking the story, finally paid off when Judge

Jagdeep Singh sent the accused godman, Gurmeet Singh to jail to await his punishment.
Predictably, and right under the nose of an indolent Government, his private army went on a rampage. Many were killed; hundreds, wounded. Enraged public opinion finally forced the State to call in the army. The rapist is now behind bars, sentenced to 20 years RI and the mayhem caused will have to be paid for by his Dera, the judge has ordered.
The judgment has been widely acclaimed. Now demands have been raised that two other godmen incarcerated for similar crimes be swiftly tried. It will hopefully rid us of a pernicious bunch of criminals masquerading as men of god. Their power comes from political patronage.
And now: the footnote. The Maharashtra Government went to the High Court last week, demanding the noise pollution cases being heard by Justice Abhay Oka, one of our most upright judges, be taken away from him because he was biased. Biased? Biased against what? Noise pollution? Is that a bad thing to be? The State proudly proclaimed it had amended the rules and shut down all silent zones in the city. Now why would any self respecting Government do that?

Mumbai leads the top noise polluted cities in the world.
Fortunately, the bar associations went up in arms. So did the media, the public. So strong was the resistance that quietly on Monday the cases were returned to Justice Oka. The Government was forced to apologise. The judge now wants the apology in the form of a signed affidavit. Yet another victory for public opinion.
Yes, it was, indeed, a week of utmost happiness.

In a discussion with Pradeep Thakur he also shares his view on friction between judiciary and legislature:

With government proposing a law on triple talaq, is it not time for Law Commission to submit its report on UCC?
We are preparing a report on the uniform civil code. This is too big a subject and we will give our recommendations on how to change family laws, covering all religions. It will not be limited to sharia; we will make suggestions for appropriate changes in all marriage laws whether they relate to Hindus, Parsis, Christians or Muslims. The report will take time as we are going into details of all marriage laws in the country and consulting all stakeholders.
What areas of legal reforms is the Law Commission currently working on?
We are examining the issue of legalising gambling and betting and whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India should be brought under the purview of the Right to Information Act. The reforms needed in the family laws is another issue we are working on. The first two issues were referred to us by Supreme Court and we will soon submit our recommendations.
Government has said it will bring a bill to ban instant triple talaq. What are your views?
The Supreme Court order on the triple talaq is a binding order on everybody. Instant talaq is void ab initio and cannot be given effect to. The government can simply say (through legislation) what can be the consequences if someone violates this law and what remedies are available for aggrieved persons. The government has not consulted us on bringing any amendments to ban triple talaq.
On the occasion of National Law Day there was an attack on judiciary from ministers for lack of accountability. How do you see this?
It was not an attack on the judiciary. In a democracy everyone has the right to express himself. This is a sign of a mature democracy. It is also a means of check and balance. It should not be seen as an accusation coming from ministers. They have more sense of responsibility, and it is just that in their view they think the courts were exceeding their jurisdiction.
Has the judiciary sometimes stepped into policy arenas, as suggested by ministers?
Courts are always conscious and aware of their limitations and the principle of self-restraint. No one would like to encroach on other’s territory.
Do you see conflict between the judiciary and legislature affecting the justice delivery system?
Apparently, it may look like that, but in reality it is not so as there is no real conflict between the two. It (the recent exchanges) should not be taken otherwise, rather it shows that the Indian democracy is much more mature and vibrant than it seems.
Do you think the collegium system of appointing judges is necessary for the independence of judiciary?
If you look at the Supreme Court judgment on the National Judicial Appointments Commission, the constitution bench itself had said that the collegium system is not perfect and requires improvement. The memorandum of procedure as suggested by the bench, providing guidelines for appointment of judges, is yet to be finalised. It is important to bring in more transparency in appointments.
NJAC with some modifications, by incorporating suggestions made in the judgment, could have been a better solution and would also have protected the judiciary’s independence. However, it is still a matter of discussion by all the stakeholders and they should factor in transparency and accountability.
Why has the judiciary not been able to fix unlimited adjournments in courts despite a law being there?
Earlier, there was no such practice of (unlimited) adjournments, at least in Supreme Court. It is a new development which should be resolved through negotiations between the Bar and the bench. There are still some benches in Supreme Court where adjournment is generally not granted. In the lower courts, because there are large number of cases listed before a judge everyday which cannot be decided that day, the courts are liberal in granting adjournments in spite of amendments made in the civil procedure code (restricting adjournments to a maximum of three in exceptional cases). The case management system in courts has to be evolved so that only a limited number of cases are listed before a judge on a given day.

Shah further said that courts should not give orders that work to break the faith of the people. If Shah’s comments are to be taken at face value, then they clearly constitute a majoritarian agenda. There are two aspects to Shah’s remarks. First, in asking for implementable orders, Shah is basically saying that orders that are perceived to be against the majority faith/tradition won’t be respected. Not only does this fly in the face of the Supreme Court’s authority, it sets a dangerous precedent whereby a majority formation can reject judicial injunctions.
And if courts were to give judgments keeping in mind perceived majority wishes then they wouldn’t need to exist at all. One could simply follow so-called majority traditions and sentiments – which themselves can be constructed by vested political interests – to decide matters. Similarly, to ask courts to refrain from giving orders that offend the faith of a community is again incongruent with our constitutional scheme. While the constitution guarantees freedom of religion, it also gives equal weightage to secularism and equality.
Besides, if Shah and BJP can be welcoming of Supreme Court’s judgment striking down the Muslim practice of triple talaq, then how can they oppose the judgment of the same court that lifted the ban on entry of women (10-50 years) to Sabarimala? In both cases the apex court found that the practices were not essential to their respective religions. Hence, what is sauce for the goose has to be sauce for the gander. BJP’s position on the matter can only mean that it wants Hindu practices and religious sentiments to be held superior to the adjudication of the judiciary. That simply won’t do.
At the end of a day, a modern, plural democracy has to play by the rules. And it is the job of the judiciary to enforce the rules and adjudicate disputes in accordance with the Constitution. A political party can’t profess faith in the Constitution when a judgment favours its political agenda and then slam the judiciary when its order seems politically inconvenient. If there are disagreements with a ruling, there is always the option of judicial review. But respect for the authority of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, ought to be sacrosanct. In questioning the apex court’s Sabarimala judgment, the BJP president is undermining that judicial authority. This could unravel the constitutional scheme and pave the way for chaos.

     You are generalizing tribal talaq which affects all Muslim women in the country versus a tradition of only one particular temple. And remember, it is not a ban on all women of all ages. So your argument is not well grounded. The Supreme Court gave a ruling based on gender discrimination whereas the temple is saying there is no gender discrimination since women of only reproductive age are not allowed due to Dietys Celibate status....

At one level, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ‘protected’ himself from the law the same way people wielding power – and those seeking it – shield themselves: by sheer popularity. It was this ‘popular mandate’ that lashed out in Panchkula when confronted with the ‘very unpopular’ prospect of their ‘beloved leader’ being sentenced to jail on charges of rape.
At another level, and a very heartening one at that, the Dera Sacha Sauda chief ’s protective device of having enough supporters to make their reactions count, for facilitators in political and administrative positions of power, failed. The law did not buckle under ‘popular pressure’ and treat him with kid gloves, as many of us may have silently been afraid of before the sentencing on Friday afternoon: Ram Rahim Singh is now in jail.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-91755"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1.png"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1.png 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-300x225.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
Popular will work both ways. In the case of the 2012 rape of ‘Nirbahaya’ in Delhi, it was the wave of public mood – anger, desperation, and more anger – that not only ‘pressurised’ the law to act swiftly against the rapists, but it also was responsible for the Indian Penal Code, India Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to be amended via the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013, to toughen sexual offences laws.
Public pressure actually reopened the Jessica Lal murder case in 2006, after the accused, Manu Sharma, along with others had been acquitted by a trial court. India’s middle-classes, notorious till then for being the ‘silent majority’ even in matters that disturbed them, reacted with adequate anger. Manu Sharma’s protection as the son of a wealthy and influential MP from Haryana was no match for popular will. What was popular will in those cases, showed its face as the ‘ugly mob’ in Haryana last weekend. With scores of people dead and property damaged, Ram Sahim Singh’s supporters went berserk at the news of their ‘guru’s’ imprisonment.
Denial was followed by angry bewilderment. But this was no candlelight vigil at India Gate, but mob atavism – although emoting the same kind of feeling in their own heads that angry and disappointed ‘good citizens’ had felt when they felt the law of the land letting them down and justice denied. For let there be no doubt that those who went on rampage last weekend, view the jailed Dera Sacha Sauda leader as a victim.
It is the same skewed reasoning of condoning practices such as the instantaneous triple talaq as a‘personal law’ of a community – in this case, of a cult – that applied to supporters of Ram Rahim Singh. It isn’t that thousands of his supporters believe him to be innocent of rape; they just believe that his crime doesn’t matter and should be beyond the law by virtue of his status as a ‘godman’.
Which is why it mattered so much how the law and order authorities controlled and defanged this mob. Which is also why the Punjab and Haryana High Court firmly stated on Saturday that the Haryana government had “surrendered” to this mob “just to allure the vote bank”.
The charge against the Manohar Lal Khattar government is serious not because of the political patronage the Dera chief sought – and got — from the administration, because the cult leader sought and got ‘political support’ across the political spectrum over the years. It is serious because it shows the danger in this country of mixing up ‘the will of the people’ with ‘the wants of a mob’. Perhaps, the imprisonment of the Dera chief itself can be a landmark case for the political classes to realise that no longer can they pass off the screeches of ‘villagers with torches and pitchforks’ as ‘candlelight vigil protesters’. Be sure, India hasn’t seen the last of mob justice yet. One just hopes that this mob justice will no more be delivered.

The accusation is absolutely right.
The BJP has indeed played political football with triple talaq by passing an ordinance making the practice a criminal act. And the political football it has played belongs to the major league class, if not World Cup class, leaving the opposition, most notably the Congress, totally flatfooted.
The banning of triple talaq – which has been outlawed in Pakistan since 1961 – has been widely hailed by all those, of all creeds and of both genders, who favour social progress and equality.
The legislation on triple talaq was stuck in Parliament because of the opposition, and by using the ordinance route to this regressive practice the BJP has struck a decisive blow for women’s empowerment.
The saffron party has managed to project itself as being truly secular, as distinct from the Congress which, after the Shah Bano case, has invited the charge of resorting to vote-bank pseudo-secularism.
The argument that by criminalising triple talaq and jailing the offender, the law will leave the affected family without a breadwinner doesn’t hold water.
By summarily divorcing his wife through triple talaq the husband has already shown himself to be an undependable provider. In any case, the new law does have the provision of bail for the offender, enabling him to earn a livelihood and provide for his dependents.
In the meantime, the opposition, and most of all the Congress, has also played political football with triple talaq. The only difference being that, unlike the BJP, it has scored a same-side goal.

The BJP may, of course, compromise with the united opposition and agree to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha. However, apart from dragging the matter into the monsoon session, even this is unlikely to clear the logjam.
The disagreement is not merely about the criminalisation of triple talaq, an iniquitous practice that had the sanction of law until the Supreme Court declared it void last year, and the right of divorced Muslim women to maintenance and custody of minor children. Nominally at least, every political party has paid lip service to the principle of gender justice. Even the argument against criminal proceedings and harsh punishment of those Muslim men who persist with unilateral triple talaq to divorce their wives is couched in compassion for the deserted wife and her children. Never mind the smokescreen, the disagreements are far more fundamental.

It almost seems astonishing that no Parliament of independent India has ever thought it fit to modify the laws on which Muslim personal law rests: the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 and the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. In 1986, the Rajiv Gandhi government passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights upon Divorce) Act that negated the Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case sanctioning alimony to a divorced Muslim woman. It was a retrograde piece of legislation.
Independent India has passed innumerable laws that have reinforced the principle of gender justice and overturned customs and practices that were discriminatory towards women. In some recent laws, the stick has actually been bent in the other direction. Tragically, none of these have touched the plight of Muslim women who continue to be governed by laws that were formulated by unrepresentative legislatures of pre-Independence India.

It is not that this iniquity was unrecognised. It was with the idea of framing just laws that corresponded to modern citizenship that the Constituent Assembly enacted Article 44: “The state shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.” In the debate on the Special Marriage Bill on May 21, 1954, Jawaharlal Nehru told the Lok Sabha about its universal application: “The Bill affects not Hindus only, but is permissive for anybody, but I referred to the Hindu aspect because that aspect comes up before us repeatedly… ” Indeed, in introducing the Bill, the then law minister C C Biswas posited it as a step in the direction of a uniform civil code.
The commitment has not been honoured. The subsequent decades witnessed backsliding to such an extent that the demand for Muslim personal law reform and uniform civil code have come to be equated with assaults on secularism. The Nehruvian consensus deemed that the Muslim personal law will be left untouched as long as there is no demand from within the community for reform. As his biographer S Gopal put it, in Nehru’s worldview, “the problem of minorities was basically one for the majority community to handle. The test of success was not what the Hindus thought but how the Muslims and other communities felt.”
In practice, this has meant that the ulama, the most organised section of the Muslim community, and its appendage bodies such as the All India Muslim Personal Law Board have invariably got their way. The AIMPLB declared that the Triple Talaq Bill “encroaches upon the fundamental rights of equality and rights set out in Article 25 of the Constitution” and proclaimed its total opposition. It was this threat that prompted all those parties over-reliant on the Muslim vote to close ranks in the Rajya Sabha.
There is a presumption among ‘secular’ parties that the Triple Talaq Bill is a Muslim issue and that its non-enactment won’t agitate the majority community and automatically trigger a Hindu consolidation. This may be true. But in one respect this modest bid to force all divorces to go through the judicial route — it does not affect the male bias of the Muslim divorce laws — is a big first step. Apart from indicating that Muslim personal laws can be modified and even reformed if there is political will, it is an attempt to tackle the grim reality of differentiated citizenship.
In independent India all citizens are equal but Muslim women are less equal than others.

The court further emphasised that no personal law board is above the Constitution and hence personal laws of any community cannot claim supremacy over constitutional rights granted to individuals. This is a welcome observation that upholds the principle of equality and gender justice.
It will be recalled that the Supreme Court is currently seized with a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq and other Islamic practices related to marriage like nikah halala and polygamy. In fact, the central government has already submitted before the apex court its opinion that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and that the issue needs to be considered in light of gender justice and non-discrimination. There’s no denying that the practice of triple talaq in India has taken ridiculous forms with women being divorced through postcards and SMSes. Given that religious orthodoxy insists that only men enjoy the right of divorce, triple talaq leaves Muslim women extremely vulnerable.
In such a scenario, the law needs to be on the side of the exploited. Besides, triple talaq as practised by the Muslim community in India isn’t observed in many Muslim-majority nations. In fact, triple talaq has been banned in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Hence, contrary to the claim of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the practice isn’t essential to Islam. Neither does it enjoy universal acceptance since most petitioners against triple talaq are Muslim women. Thus, the Allahabad high court observation should encourage the petitioners and hopefully pave the way for their victory in the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court observation that the practice of instant triple talaq violates the constitutional rights of Muslim women had produced the desired result of relieving stress of families, but the penalty clause in the act now shows it is not about rectification of flaws in the Muslim family law. It would only further vitiate strained relations between couples.
This should act as a wake-up call for the clergy to introspect what went wrong that led to the present predicament. When the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha last year, office bearers of the Muslim Personal Law Board had a series of meetings with the leaders of political parties and pressured them to vote in the Rajya Sabha according to the wishes of the Muslim community. This time, this line of action was not followed. And Muslim friendly parties showed their true colours under the pressure of the BJP and for the fear of being accused of playing vote bank politics.

It all began with the Shah Banu verdict by the Supreme Court in 1985, the AIMPLB-led by Moulana Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi approached Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and wanted a relief. Rajiv Gandhi passed a law to relieve the Muslim community and pleaded with the board to chart out all the clauses of the Muslim family law, such that it could be codified through a parliamentary act, through which all Muslim family disputes could be resolved. Thirty-four years have elapsed, but no action has been taken. The board believes that the Islamic family law does not warrant any further research. Though they agree that triple talaq in one sitting is not mentioned in the Quran and Hadees and it is a ‘bid’at’(innovation), they still followed it.
During the trial of the triple talaq case last year, the Supreme Court judge argued that when such a talaq is not permitted in Islam, why the insistence on legalising it. The board counsel replied that it is because it has been in practice for more than 1,000 years. The judge’s argument exposed the poor knowledge and baseless need to follow tradition. The judge further said that any wrong thing practiced for a long time could be termed as ‘right’.
AIMPLB is yet to codify a model ‘nikahnama’ (marriage), despite pressure from some of its members. Going by this attitude and by the history of the board, the attribution of Moulana Ahmed Bukhari of Delhi Jama Masjid seems to be credible that the top brass of the board lacks the wisdom of a Momin (mominana firasat).
This is an irony that AIMPLB, since its inception in 1973 began the campaign for educating Muslim masses about the correct method of pronouncement of talaq only after the BJP started campaigning against it. The views of great scholars like Tahir Mahmood and Faizan Mustafa were rejected just because they don’t conform to the ulema’s viewpoint on this issue. If only they had been accommodated, the board would not have suffered such a humiliation in court.
The board should wake up and start codification of Muslim law by accommodating ‘the other’ viewpoints as well. But the major question is whether the government would accept the proposed amendments.

The law codifies the Supreme Court judgment that made illegal instant triple talaq, given orally or through other forms in one sitting. It will undo the injustice done to Muslim women by the 1986 law, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act.
The current legislation is concerned only with the practice of instant or triple talaq. It does not make illegal or criminalise other pathways to divorce set out in the Sharia. The criminalisation of triple talaq, making it a cognisable offence attracting jail time of three years, provides a measure of protection for the women. It gives women the necessary and concrete backing in law to demand that the law and order machinery step in and take action. It also places on the police the onus of taking action against an individual who seeks to divorce his wife through the instant talaq route.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-97454"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gfx-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""656"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gfx-1.jpg 630w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gfx-1-288x300.jpg 288w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gfx-1-50x52.jpg 50w"" sizes=""(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"">
The hope is, in attaching real consequences, men will be deterred from using triple talaq as a threat to control women. The legislation acknowledges that even though triple talaq is not recognised by law, women who use seek recourse on basis of this law are likely to find themselves in financial difficulty. The law, therefore, makes it mandatory for the husband to provide support to his wife and children. This provision partially corrects the situation emerging after the 1986 law that was passed to circumvent the Supreme Court’s ruling in Shah Bano case.
The fight against triple talaq is but a small part of the struggle for gender justice for Muslim women. That, again, is just one step in removing extreme gender inequality in the country that finds expression as violence against women.

     The supreme court has already banned the instant triple talaq,so when a muslim man pronounces triple talaq it is invalid,talaq-divorce does not take place,then why punish the man?.Ultimately the Government is sending a clear message to the Muslim men dont divorce just abandon your wives,like great leaders have did,even Ram abandoned his heavily pregnant wife Sita.Jai ho Vande matram....

Speaking with Eram Agha, Javed discussed the shockingly high incidence of triple talaq petitioned against by 50,000 Muslims recently, stubborn resistance to reforms from Muslim patriarchal leaders – and why she thinks talk of a Uniform Civil Code won’t help:
While making this film, what kinds of facts came to light?
Honestly, we were startled by the numbers – we didn’t know that so many women encountered this method of divorce or lived in the fear that their husband may throw them out of the house anytime.
All the women we spoke to wanted a ban. Many saw triple talaq as a violation of either their constitutional or Islamic rights – or both.
We also felt incredulity when religious leaders defended halala as practised today.
What are the challenges in achieving a ban on triple talaq?
Members within the community have acquired positions of authority and want to maintain status quo – they refuse to acknowledge interpretations of the Quran that align with the modern discourse on women’s rights. Their world view and reading of religious texts are very patriarchal.
Further, Muslim women’s voices are ignored – they’ve been excluded from the discourse on their legal rights by both dominant Muslim bodies and the government.
There is politics – everyone knows triple talaq and halala are oppressive to women but who will bell the cat?
Who will risk losing a vote bank?
Is this feminist struggle restricted to Muslim communities?
The struggle against patriarchy is by no means limited to Muslim communities. Activists are striving to get domestic violence accepted as a legitimate ground for divorce in Mississippi. Hindu women in India recently won the right to be kartas in their family. Women are fighting patriarchal laws everywhere.
Muslims do encounter discrimination post 9/11 – however, we can’t allow that to stop us from working on unjust practices in the community.
AIMPLB members are clear about not doing away with triple talaq – and feel polygamy is possibly lower among Muslims than others.
What is the credibility of personal law board as representative of all Muslims in India?
And does the fact that one community might be indulging in unfair practices somehow justify its occurrence in other communities?
Given the deadlock, what is the solution?
Muslim women activists want government to intervene and ban triple talaq and halala.
They also want Muslim personal law to be codified, so that it’s followed in a uniform way.
Pakistan’s Islamic law board has approved ‘light beating’ of wives. Couldn’t Indian Muslim women find themselves in such a situation – unless all laws are made fully uniform?
These are the voices of orthodox and patriarchal religious leaders which are being actively condemned in Pakistan and outside – whether that bill passes or not remains to be seen.
The Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, whom we have been filming, works at grassroots level as social worker activists. Every week, women and men come to them with issues of triple talaq and halala.
When we try to encroach upon the space that Muslim women have created for reforms to Muslim personal law, and instead of those reforms, we start discussing a Uniform Civil Code, we do them no good – discussion on Uniform Civil Code then just becomes another tool to suppress their voice.
Hindu women have been successful in getting the judiciary to intervene on reforms to Hindu laws. Triple talaq is an urgent issue – the best thing we can do is amplify the voices of women who want it banned.
What are some of the most shocking stories you encountered?
All of them shocked. Every single time.
I remember talking to a woman who was divorced through triple talaq eight years ago. Even now, she had not gotten over the shock of being divorced so suddenly – she just hadn’t been able to rationalise how it happened.
According to her, theirs was a happy marriage – but to go back to her husband, she’d have to go through halala, which she refused.
It really shakes you up – it was hard to just listen and not react or break down during the interviews. Even now, when we’re editing and listening to the women’s stories again, it takes a lot emotionally.
But we get strength from the women themselves speaking up – because they want to fight this.

     it is difficult to grasp the rationale of the indignation of protesters like s. javed in the matter of triple talak. the aberrant contradiction does not seem to concern them. on one hand they stick to the maintenance of the civil law according to the sharia and on the other they claim to own individual rights according to the 1950 constitution. if they do not challenge the constitutional clause allowing for the provisional continuation of the sharia, which was institutionalised in the british india act and it came into force in 1937, they cannot logically claim to be victims of the triple oral &#039;talak&#039; injustice, and of patriarchy, while at the  same   time endorsing their adherence to the &quot;provisional&quot; sharia. as things stand, for the indian muslim, the sharia prescription in personal law overrides those of the common legal code. to criticise the conservative men who, in the aimplb, for instance, are viewed as being close-minded or unwilling to take a more liberal or charitable view of the feminine condition, is to let fly bolts against the wrong target. were liberal women like shazia javed to be in charge of the aimplb they would still have to follow and advocate and implement the letter and the spirit of the sharia civil law. after all the shah bano case did not generate the collective support of the indian muslim women....

He totally rejects the fact that India has changed for the better; housing for the poor; toilets; electricity; low inflation and much better planning and delivery.
He says every cell of his body resists BJP’s idea of India, which shows just how out of touch he is with the people of India, and how much in touch he is with Dynasty politics. The so-called secular view of India that he claims he stands for has done little for the minorities in the fifty plus years of Dynasty.
Arif Mohammed Khan, once a Congressman has said so again and again. In recent interviews, he has said that he was for the Triple Talaq Bill and spoke about it in parliament but Rajiv Gandhi overturned a Supreme Court decision for votes. Was this not an act to destroy an institution?
Arif resigned and later was asked to take back his resignation but refused and one Congress minister told him, he was stubborn and that he should realize that the party was interested in votes and if the Muslims wanted to remain in the gutter what was his problem!
I am stunned by this and the fact that Rahul in spite of this, and several other such evidence still thinks the Congress does not divide and rule. His family even divided the Sikhs and brought about horror in Punjab and Delhi.
He also forgot that it was his party that played to Pakistan and brought in the whole bogey of Saffron Terror.
It was his family that destroyed the institutions of India, from banking to the judiciary during Indira Gandhi’s term. A UPA minister destroyed Air India. It was between 2004 and 2014 that India had scam after scam which made it look like the Banana Republic.
Institution after Institution was named after The Dynasty; including airports; government schemes; colleges; parks and hospitals. Their cronies were appointed to every major job from writing the history of India for students to distorting every aspect of Sanatam Dharma and portraying a very negative and distorted version of our great civilization to our own people and abroad.
The excuses made in his resignation letter for the Congress defeat are full of inuendoes against the BJP but say little about how his party itself had lost the plot. He actually thinks that the state machinery was against him not even realizing it was the voters.
“It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India,” Rahul Gandhi said. Does he ever stop to think how very ridiculous it sounds when only a few months ago when Congress won in three states, he did not utter a word.
Rahul’s letter ends with dire warnings on how India will suffer because he did not become Prime Minister.
Frankly, the resignation letter, tweeted even before it got to his party members, proved how very immature and deluded Rahul really is. But then what can one expect from an almost 50-year-old who has never had to earn a living. Not exactly an icon for the youth of India who has to work to achieve something or the millions that work to make two ends meet. Even his critics can’t deny that Rahul Gandhi is at best a reluctant politician and has lived a life of luxury since he was born – a privilege handed down by the dynasty.

     A very honest and candid reality check presented for the Congress and its supporters who still vote for this fossilized 'Family' operated party. Calling Rahul a 'reluctant' politician is an insult to the voter because an Idiot does not have any capacity to be engaged &/or reluctant. He is basically in politics because of his 'borrowed'  family name which was originally adopted to confuse and fool the Nation by trying to create a false association with the M. K. Gandhi brand recall!! It is huge blessing in disguise for the future of the Nation that Rahul managed to expose Congress and its lies so effectively since entering active politics by virtue of his birth!! Thank God for small mercies....  Read More

Her group, the Quran Sunnath Society, adheres only to the Quran and not subsequent works such as Hadith. She spoke to Jiby J Kattakayam about her understanding of Islam and the attendant struggle:

How did you depart from the mainstream?
I was forced to marry against my wishes. I wanted a divorce but there was no support from any quarter. I experienced it in my own life, how family, Muslim society and even secular structures like Women’s Commission let down Muslim women by citing shariat. I got a divorce after a lot of effort. At college I used to ask questions which my teachers couldn’t answer and they turned vindictive. This prompted me to think, do my own reading, and slowly I gravitated towards Chekannur Maulavi’s ideas.
How different is your group from others?
Chekannur Maulavi’s main precept was that Quran is Allah’s sole bequest to humans and no other book needs to be followed. Quran has capacity to reflect and absorb changes in society over time. Everything else like the Hadiths (records of Prophet’s actions and sayings) were written long after Prophet’s death. On birth control, Chekannur would say a life must not be taken but there was no bar on contraceptive procedures. He argued that Quran gave equal rights to sons and daughters in inheritance and did not discriminate between men and women. Chekannur was a courageous man and he earned many followers. But his murder was a setback. His absence also created ideological rifts among his followers, who were virtually orphaned by his sudden passing.
You are facing a lot of hatred for leading namaaz. Where does it come from?
I am not able to step out of home. I have police protection. Death threats are being issued. There is a vilification campaign against me. Kerala has a tradition of initially rejecting progressive ideas. When government first opened schools, Islamic preachers cited the primacy of religious instruction. Government next pleaded to send students to schools for some hours to learn Malayalam but to no avail. When grants were offered to Malayalam teachers they obstructed that too. Malayalam was denounced as the language of kafirs and English as the language of hell. Today, the clerics are silent on their past follies. Even now they treat women as second class citizens. Left to such preachers, women won’t even be taught to read. Because I oppose them I have to pay a heavy price.
Why are attacks on you vicious?
The priestly class is unable to demolish my views with facts or logic. They fear I will expose their lies and ignorance. No one is willing to engage me in a dialogue. The so called responses are just personal attacks.
Central government is vocal about Muslim women’s rights. What are your views?
I am no member of any political party or follow any political ideology. I look at the good that people do. Triple talaq survived so long because politicians feared clerics’ disapproval. The Supreme Court judgment said triple talaq violated fundamental rights and was not sanctioned by Quran. On criminalising it, shouldn’t such husbands be jailed? Triple talaq is a criminal act because it creates destitutes. The children of such injustice owe nothing to society, and could turn criminals tomorrow. On removing Haj subsidy, Quran says only those with financial position and health should go for Haj. You don’t go with someone’s largesse or government support. Let this money be used for minority education.
Chekannur’s death left a scar on Kerala society that LDF/UDF governments ignored. Why so?
We are a minority in a minority. If the Hindu Aikya Vedia and BJP had not expressed solidarity with me, I would have been stoned to death. Chekannur was murdered because there was no one to speak for him or help him and this emboldened the conspirators. Both LDF and UDF have electoral considerations in mind. We have requested the Centre to get NIA to investigate Chekannur’s death.
How much has Indian state touched the lives of Muslim women?
The Indian Constitution is fine, but it failed to touch Muslim women. Article 13 elevates fundamental rights over other laws, Article 14 broaches equality and Article 15 shuns discrimination on religious/ gender grounds. Despite these, the unequal position of Muslim women remains, because Indian state was weak. But education is making a big difference. In sports you will notice how no PT Usha or Anju Bobby George came from among Muslim women but now there is a Sania Mirza. My daughter is also an athlete. Women’s reservation in Parliament is needed just like reservation in panchayats (which) was revolutionary. More women like Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalithaa must come to the forefront in politics. Change is in the air.

     Society has to evolve. You can't cling on to something for 1400 years. Muslims don't have to go around preaching Islam and explaining true meaning. If Islam is a way of life then let it be that way. Everyone has the freedom to live life in his own way. Hence it's absolutely fine to understand Islam in one's own way....

But can this freedom of religion trump fundamental rights like the right to equality? In response to a Supreme Court notice on a clutch of petitions challenging triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy as violating women’s right to equality in the name of religion, the Centre has taken a strong position that gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable overarching constitutional values and can brook no compromise. This is the modern, secular, democratic and just position.
While many Muslims welcome such movement towards abolishing triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy, it continues to face strong and vociferous resistance from certain conservative Muslim organisations, whose counterarguments range from sexist to bizarre. AIMPLB for example argues that banning polygamy and triple talaq will mean many women will stay spinsters as they outnumber men (no they don’t) and will force husbands to get rid of their wives by murdering them. What undermines the conservatives completely is that many countries where Islam is the state religion have already banned practices like triple talaq. When religion is not impervious to reform or reinterpretation even in theocratic countries, how can it remain so in a secular democracy?
There had been concerns that the matter would be muddled by a simultaneous push for a Uniform Civil Code, where the BJP led government would be suspected of baiting Muslims rather than championing women. But the response of the Centre in the Supreme Court has remained focussed on women’s constitutional rights to equality. This is the right approach for building momentum to free all citizens from the patriarchal time warp.

     there  were  or are, cms with more than a living wife at a time. such abnormalities do not make a rule. if one likes another woman he has to pay alimony to his wife and seek divorce.  and then only he can marry.  he cannot dump his former wife and children to the care of the society! men with more than a wife should be penalized. and a man or a woman should not  be a genetic father or mother of more than two children....

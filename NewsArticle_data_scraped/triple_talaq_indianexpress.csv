CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury today claimed that the BJP will taste another electoral defeat in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said the voters of Delhi and Bihar had already given “talaq” to the saffron party and it was going to get the same “message” for the third time from the voters of Uttar Pradesh.

“They are opposing triple talaq. BJP has already been given talaq twice in the Delhi and Bihar polls. Modi is going to get the third one from the people of Uttar Pradesh in the ensuing Assembly election. And finally, they will be ousted by the people in the 2019 general election,” Yechury told a meeting organised by the Dalit Hakkula Sadhana Samiti here.
He accused the Centre of “unleashing a financial emergency” in the name of demonetisation and claimed that the move was expected to have a bearing on the country’s economic growth.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said the NDA government did not take any step to arrest the likes of Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya, while BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy was not arrested, in spite of spending a huge amount on his daughter’s wedding after the currency ban.
BR Ambedkar’s grandson and former MP Prakash Ambedkar alleged that a major chunk of black money was deposited in the banks before November 8, the day Modi announced demonetisation."

“The move of banning triple talaq is a conspiracy to impose a uniform civil code,” he alleged. He, however, said in Islam divorce is considered an unpleasant act and is discouraged.

On October 7, the Centre had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.

ON TUESDAY, the day it was originally slated to examine the Constitutional validity of triple talaq and polygamy, the Supreme Court will set out to analyse whether the words “Hindutva” and “Hinduism” connote the “way of life” of the Indian people and not just Hindu religious practices.
More than 20 years after a batch of judgments ruled that these words are “indicative more of a way of life of the Indian people and are not confined merely to describe persons practising the Hindu religion as a faith”, a seven-judge Constitution Bench will revisit this matter and other judgments on the issue.
The BJP, which leads the NDA government, had underlined one such judgment from 1995 in its election manifestos and to counter accusations of it being communal, to assert that even the apex court has endorsed the true meaning of Hindutva and Hinduism.

In December 1995, Justice J S Verma, writing for a three-judge Supreme Court bench, had held that seeking votes in the name of Hinduism is not a “corrupt practice” under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, which would result in setting aside the election of winning candidates.
Section 123 (3-A) defines “corrupt practice” as promotion of, or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language, by a candidate or his agent.
Relying on this provision, the Bombay High Court had set aside the election of many BJP-Shiv Sena candidates in the Maharashtra assembly polls at the time.
Adjudicating on appeals by leaders such as Bal Thackerey, Manohar Joshi and R Y Prabhoo, the three-judge Supreme Court bench held that “Hinduism” and “Hindutva” were not necessarily to be understood and construed narrowly, confined only to strict Hindu religious practices.
”Unless the context of a speech indicates a contrary meaning or use, in the abstract, these terms are indicative more of a way of life of the Indian people and are not confined merely to describe persons practicing the Hindu religion as a faith,” the apex court noted.
Justice Verma said that the mere fact that these words (Hindutva or Hinduism) are used in speech would not bring them within the prohibition of sub-section (3) or (3A) of Section 123. “It may well be that these words are used in the speech to promote secularism and to emphasise the way of life of the Indian people and the Indian culture or ethos, or to criticise the policy of any political party as discriminatory or intolerant,” the court ruled.
It cited two previous five-judge bench decisions in the Sastri Yagnapurushadji and others Vs Muldas Bhudarda Vaishya and another of 1966; and the Commissioner of Wealth tax, Madras and others Vs late R Sridharan by Legal Representatives case of 1976 to support the proposition that Hinduism indicated culture and not religious practices.
The court subsequently held as valid the election of Sena’s Joshi, who had admittedly said in one of his election speeches that “the first Hindu State will be established in Maharashtra” and Ramchandra Kapse, a BJP candidate, which had in its election manifesto appealed for votes by referring to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.
Four months after this verdict, another three-judge Supreme Court bench adjudicating the Abhiram Singh Vs C D Commachen & Ors case said that it would be appropriate if a five-judge bench examines the scope of inquiry to be conducted when such charges of “corrupt practices” are levelled.
In January 2014, when a five-judge bench was hearing this matter, the court was informed that identical issues had been raised in an election petition filed against BJP leader Sunderlal Patwa — the matter was then referred to a bench of seven judges, which will now start hearings."

Alleging that “communal” forces have launched an offensive on identity of minorities, CPI(M) on Tuesday said any move to push Uniform Civil Code “as is being done by the government” will be counterproductive for women’s rights even as it favoured reforms in personal laws of all communities, including Hindus. The Left party supported the demand of section of Muslim women against the practice of “arbitrary and instant” triple talaq and said reforms were needed in personal laws of the “majority community” too as that they “discriminate” against women.

“With the offensive of communal forces on the very identity of minority communities, any move to push the agenda of UCC as is being done by the government directly and through its institutions is counterproductive for the rights of women. Uniformity is not the guarantee for equality,” the CPI(M) said in a statement.
Slamming the government over claims of “its spokespersons” that personal laws for Hindu women have already been reformed, the CPI(M) said the remarks show their interest is not in securing women’s equality, but is in targeting minority communities, particularly Muslims.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Even now laws concerning, adoption, property rights and even the right to choose your own partner discriminate against Hindu women,” the party said, seeking to pick holes in government’s alleged claim.
The CPI(M) extended support to the demand against the practice of triple talaq and noted it is not permitted in most Islamic countries.
“Acceptance of this demand will bring relief to affected women. All personal laws including those for the majority community require reform,” the CPI(M) said."

The Vice President of AIMPLB has said that the board will end the practice of triple talaq itself in one-and-a-half years so the government should not interfere in the matter. Kalbe Sadiq also advised the Muslims against eating beef. Sadiq, who was in Bijnor on Tuesday to attend a programme, was speaking to reporters at the residence of President of District Civil Bar Association.
The Shia scholar said the triple talaq system was unfair to women but it was a personal affair for the community and they would solve it themselves within one to one-and-a-half years. He said the government should not interfere in it. On the issue of beef consumption, he said in religious books eating beef is not advised and Muslims should not have it.

Sadiq said if the government enacts laws banning cow slaughter and beef eating in the country, the Muslims would welcome it. He condemned the unlawful activities of cow vigilantes and demanded that it be stopped. On the Ram temple issue, he said the dispute should end now and the Hindus and the Muslims should yield some ground to each other so that a compromise could be reached.
He said Muslims should not insist on making a mosque at the site where the temple would be built. Sadiq said Muslim leaders were responsible for the poor state of the community. He said Kashmiri youths should open their eyes and understand the nefarious designs of Pakistan. He said India should be united for it to become a prosperous country."

He is right to address the special needs of backward Muslims.
At the BJP’s two-day national executive in Bhubaneswar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of the need for “social justice” to encompass backward Muslims. He is also reported to have referred specifically to the concerns of Muslim women and to the necessity of justice for them through dialogue, not conflict. The PM’s concern is commendable. He is right to address the special needs of backward Muslims.
And to intervene in the triple talaq debate on behalf of its victims. He does well to bring the weight of his office to the side of Muslim women at a time when they are being let down by powerful organisations such as the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which has yet again stopped short of taking an unequivocal stand against the unjust practice.
The PM’s acknowledgement of the special needs of backward Muslims and of Muslim women is notable for another reason: It is a welcome departure from his insistence so far on taking no names, of letting the concerns and sensitivities of minority groups be subsumed in the wide and apolitical slogan of “sabka saath sabka vikas”, which papers over the many inequities and discriminations built into the notions of “development” and the “people”. Yes, the PM broke a silence on Sunday at Bhubaneswar. But now that he has made a beginning, and for him to be really heard by those he is addressing, there are other silences that he and his government must break.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While the predicament of Muslim women oppressed by triple talaq calls for special measures, talk of gender justice only draws attention to the sidestepping of other oppressions being faced by a beleaguered minority community in times of gau rakshak vigilantism. On April 1, Pehlu Khan was beaten up by a band of gau rakshaks for transporting cattle in Behror area of Alwar on National Highway 8 — he died in hospital two days later. In the group of six accosted and assaulted that day, Arjun Lal Yadav was let off because, as he told this paper later, the attackers “went for the Muslims”. In the aftermath, a Union minister sought to deny the crime in Parliament and a Rajasthan minister suggested that “both sides” were to blame.
The evidence is building that the Alwar attack was not an act of random criminality, and that the government prevarication seen in its aftermath is also part of a pattern. Incidents of violence and vigilantism by gau rakshaks targeting Muslims have been reported from other places, in other states as well.
They are fuelled, in UP, by its new chief minister’s crackdown on “illegal” slaughter houses, and by muscular statements of other BJP chief ministers as they bring draconian legislation against cow slaughter in their states. In many ways, Alwar has become the latest emblem of this government’s minority problem in the last three years of its rule. For the PM’s concern about the Muslim community’s backwardness and the plight of its women to be heard with the attention it deserves, therefore, his government must first address the fears and insecurities that Alwar has given a name to."

(Express Archive Photo)
Member of the women’s wing of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Asma Zehra on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments against triple talaq and implementation of a uniform civil code had acted as a blessing in disguise for Muslim women.
“About 10 crore women, across the country, through a signature campaign had expressed their support for the Muslim Personal Law and had also said that they knew that the attempt to implement a uniform civil code was a tool to interfere with the Muslim Personal Law which is our constitutional right,” Zehra said. She added that Modi’s attempt had helped lakhs of Muslim women to be aware of the rules of ‘talaq’ and their rights during separation.

Zehra also said that to educate Muslim women further, there would be several technological interventions in the near future. “A toll free helpline would be made available for Muslim women in distress. Other than English and Urdu, it will be available in eight regional languages and there will be experienced regional counsellors available at the other end. Besides a website is also there to deal with the plight of Muslim women,” she said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It was found out that the board was also mulling the idea to reach the women at the ground level through smart phones. They were also in talks with agencies to develop an app downloadable on mobile phones to help Muslim women in distress.
Zehra said that India was a secular and a democratic country and that everybody had the right to pursue their own religious rights. “We fully stand in support of the triple talaq among Muslims and oppose the uniform civil code. A misinformation is being spread about triple talaq by the government. It is not true. Divorce rate is least in the Muslim community. The number of abandoned, deserted, and divorced women in other communities are many times larger. The Modi government is trying to attach the Muslim community to create an image that Muslim women were oppressed. This will not be tolerated and we will put up protests against this in a democratic and peaceful manner,” Zehra asserted."

Prominent Islamic organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind today told the Supreme Court there is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law in which triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy are well rooted and stand on much higher pedestal as compared to other customs. In its counter affidavit, the Jamiat stated that the Muslim Personal Law has an element of certainty and is not local or regional in operation.

“There is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law, which is based on primarily the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, explained and applied by various scholars of great antiquity and authority after thorough research,” it said. “The protection of peculiarities in personal laws is necessary for securing freedom of religion and bringing uniformity by removing those peculiarities shall be enforcement of Uniform Civil Code by the judicial process, which shall be against the constitutional bar,” it said.

While divided Muslim votes translate to gains for BJP, a consolidation will change the poll arithmetic as minorities play a crucial role in at least 125 of 403 constituencies, which will go to polls in early 2017.
Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s decision to revoke expulsion of his estranged cousin and senior party leader Ram Gopal Yadav might once again bring the political spotlight back on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).
As ruling SP grappled with internal feud, BSP supremo Mayawati sought to fish in troubled waters, seeking to drive a wedge in SP camp to wean away the crucial Muslim vote bank.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Muslims are considered the traditional votebank of the ruling Samajwadi Party and the concern over SP family feud has been voiced by several top clerics including, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid and Maulana Salman Nadvi of Lucknow-based Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama.
These leaders gave a blunt message to SP chief that their votes would end up with BSP if the internecine war in his party did not end.
Even a few days back, the competition seemed even – the SP was battling a damaging power struggle, BSP had been hit by desertions and Congress despite a month-long campaign to woo farmers was still struggling to be taken seriously.
But, the revocation of Ram Gopal’s suspension gave a new dimension to the highly surcharged pre-poll scenario. Mayawati termed Ram Gopal’s reinstatement as a “drama” to cover up the existing bitterness between Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal.
Political analysts say the development could drive the BSP supremo to think of a fresh strategy, especially in the communally sensitive western UP, where she anticipates a keen contest with BJP. So far, she has been harping on the feud in SP to caution Muslims “not to waste their votes”.
BSP insiders said the party was contemplating reassessing its strategy vis-a-vis Muslim vote bank, which has strongly been siding with SP post Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.
They were of the view that revocation of Ram Gopal’s suspension was an effort by Samajwadi Party to project itself as a united outfit, especially after a bitter infighting between Akhilesh and Shivpal two months ago.
Sources said Mayawati had directed her deputy Naseemuddin Siddiqui and his son Afzal to accelerate BSP campaign in western UP to mobilize Muslim voters and showcase the party that can halt the saffron surge.
She has also promised a substantial chunk of tickets to Muslims to ensure that the community backs her party over SP. Insiders said the party will take the help of social media to reach out to voters in shortest possible time.
They said Mayawati was of the firm view that wooing Muslims and galvanising them with her core Dalit vote bank could drum up a formidable alliance to take on BJP, which will stand to gain in the event of Muslim votes getting split between SP and BSP.
The triple talaq issue is also bringing the community together. Analysts say as Congress is weak and SP is engaged in family battle, BSP will be their next best option. They say that a Bihar-like ‘maha-gathbandhan’ in UP could have kept the Muslim flock together.
But, SP patriarch has ruled out any such alliance, though he said mergers with his party could be considered. As the Assembly elections draw near, BJP too seems to be re-drawing its strategy by roping in as many Muslim voters as possible before the elections, and by showing itself as the primary opponent of SP.
The saffron party expects to gain those Muslim voters who have become disenchanted with SP, especially after Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013, in which over 60 people were killed and around 50,000 rendered homeless.
Muslims are also unhappy with the SP government which has not so far fulfilled its promise to ensure 18 per cent quota for them, despite the fact that reservation is not on basis of religion.
Congress too is making frantic efforts to regain its lost organisational moorings in the state and appointed Ghulam Nabi Azad as its state incharge, hoping to attract a huge chunk of Muslim votes.
Muslims, who constitute a fifth of the state’s population of nearly 200 crore, are yet to open their cards as to which way they will go though the community is the cynosure of all eyes of major political parties."

With the battle against triple talaq gaining momentum by the day, over a million Muslims from across India with women in majority, have signed a petition to end the controversial divorce practice of triple talaq. According to the Quran, a man must consider his decision for a period of three months after he initially declared talaq, and divorce is only granted after the remaining two “talaqs” are stated.
The petition was started by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an organization affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), reports CNN, adding that the positive response to the petition has been linked with the Bharatiya Janata Patry’s recent success in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections.

The BJP won in a landslide, taking 312 seats out of a total of 403, the biggest majority for any party in Uttar Pradesh since 1980. Muslims make up 18.5% of Uttar Pradesh’s 200 million-strong population, the largest state in India, suggests the recent census.Several women have filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution. However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her. “The rights bestowed by religion can’t be questioned in a court of law,” it said.
Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asserted that he favoured the discontinuation of ‘triple talaq’, stating that “lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be destroyed by triple talaq.” He also targeted the opposition for ‘politicising’ the issue and supporting a gender discriminatory practice to appease their vote banks."

Taking objection to BJP including the ‘triple talaq’ and Ram Temple issues in its election manifesto, Congress on Wednesday demanded that the Supreme Court and the Election Commission initiate action against the saffron party in this regard. “BJP is raising disputed issues with the aim to polarise votes in the upcoming Assembly polls in the state,” AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged while replying to a query on BJP raising ‘triple talaq’ issue during campaigning in Uttar Pradesh.

“BJP has included triple talaq and Ram temple in its manifesto and as both these issues are pending in the Supreme Court, Congress has objections over it…the party demands that Supreme Court and Election Commission take note of it and initiate action against BJP,” he said after releasing party’s election manifesto here.
To BJP’s demands that Congress make clear its stand on triple talaq, Azad said his party will not speak on any contentious issue in these elections.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When his attention was drawn to over ten seats where candidates of both SP and Congress have filed their nominations despite forming an alliance, he said SP candidates had filed their papers when it appeared that the alliance will not come through and though at some places they wanted to withdraw, they could not do so due to uncertainity.
He, however, said the matter would be sorted out in a couple of days and leaders of both the parties will campaign in support of candidates declared by the alliance on the seats where nominees of both the partners have filed their papers."

“What he (Salman Khan) said was rather unfortunate and insensitive,” said Aamir Khan, when asked about the recent controversy over actor Salman Khan using “rape” as an analogy. Bollywood is facing a lot of criticism for not taking a stand on the issue. Aamir was addressing the media on Monday afternoon at the launch of the poster of his next movie, Dangal. Though both the Khans are known to be close friends, when asked if Aamir would like to give a piece of advice to Salman, the former retorted: “Who am I to advise him?”
When asked to comment on the statement made by Irrfan Khan that the idea of qurbaani needs to be introspected, Aamir said: “Religion is a very personal issue and we have our own feelings about it. I don’t want to comment on other people’s feelings.” This was followed by a question on another current issue — that of the triple talaq. Aamir excused himself from commenting on it saying that he has to read the Uniform Civil Code, at least the main parts, before he could comment on it.

Though Dangal will release on December 23, the launch of its poster, two days before the release of Salman Khan’s Sultan, was a well-planned move. Aamir made no bones about the fact that they were unveiling the poster just before Sultan hits the theatres because of the visibility that Dangal would get. “I love the look of Sultan and I hope it breaks all records. Since it would probably be a bumper hit, it would be a good opportunity for us to put up our posters at theatres and make the announcement that we would be there in six months,” said the actor.

The launch event showcased two Aamir Khans. In the massive poster put up on the dais, the actor featured as an ageing wrestler, surrounded by his four daughters in close-cropped hair and track suits. Sitting next to it was the actor, who has famously got his washboard abdomen back after shooting the portions that shows him as a 55-year-old heavyweight, flanked by Dangal director Nitish Tiwary and Disney India-UTV head Siddharth Roy Kapoor.

The remaining part will feature the younger look of the actor. At the moment, however, it is the look of a man with salt-and-pepper hair that Aamir seems to prefer. When informed that women seem to favour such “an elderly appearance” these days, the actor shot back: “Had I known this, I would not have been trying to look young for the last 25 years.”

The actor-producer confessed to having his share of doubts before taking up the role based on Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal. “I had finished doing Dhoom 3 and PK. My body fat at that time was 9 per cent. Though playing the role of a 55-year-old was closer to age, I was doing young roles. I was hesitant to take up a role in the 50-60-year age group. I thought it would not be practical. However, I let go of that logic in a couple of months and decided to follow my heart,” he said.
 
The star, however, had one request for Tiwary. He wanted to shoot the fat portions first. “Since I was very fit then, we could have shot the younger portion first.
However, I didn’t want to end up with 100 kg weight when we finished shooting. I would have had no motivation to shed those kilos. That’s why I chose to reverse the order,” he said.
As the media interaction progressed, Aamir spoke, among others, on the prevailing patriarchal mindset in India, the need for positive thinking and projecting good work in media.
His “oops moment” came when he was asked if he considered Salman to be a bigger star than himself. Aamir had no problem saying that he had always considered Salman as well as Shah Rukh to bigger stars than he was. “When Salman Khan walks into a room, it looks as if a star has entered. Whereas, I look like a waiter,” he said.
The next instance, however, he corrected himself and said, “Sorry, I should not say that. Waiters are great people. When I enter a room, it seems as if a nobody has come in and I lack the star quality of Salman and Shah Rukh.” Maybe not star power, but it certainly takes presence of mind to correct a faux pas."

He has been raising this issue at this point of time…timing of this is important, this is being done in view of the forthcoming UP elections,” CPI Rajya Sabha member D Raja said.

Senior BJP leader Prasad had yesterday said the Centre is committed to ending the “evil social practice” of triple talaq and had asked the Samajwadi Party, Congress and BSP to make their stand clear on the contentious issue.
He had said the Centre might take appropriate steps to ban triple talaq after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls as the tradition “denies” respect to women. The state goes to polls in seven phases starting February 11."

Bahraich of eastern UP remains an underdeveloped district that is hit every year by flooding caused by the Sarayu, a tributary of the Ghaghara. Yet it is not development but caste and religious identities that parties have traditionally sought to address here, either with candidate selection or with speeches.

In 1991, when the BJP won all the district’s seven seats, the sweep was widely attributed to communal polarisation in the wake of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP has not managed to match that performance since. In 2012, it won two of the seven post-delimitation seats; of these, it lost Balha (SC) in a 2014 byelection. The SP won two seats in 2012, the Congress two, the BSP one.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This time, the six unreserved seats have 16 Muslim candidates among them; last time there were 25. At a public meeting in Matera last week, the BJP’s Kaiserganj MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh urged voters to ensure the defeat of the “15 bhaijaans” contesting in Devipatan division — which includes Bahraich besides Gonda, Shrawasti and Balrampur districts. Of the 20 seats in the division, the BJP is facing a close contest from such candidates in at least 15, said Singh, who went on to list their names. Singh added the state would need a BJP-led government to build a Ram temple.
Singh spoke before Prime Minister arrived to address the meeting. The BJP MP from adjacent Shrawasti, Daddan Mishra, had said the election was a contest between two ideologies – “Bharat Mata ki jai” and “Afzal hum sharminda hain, tere qatil zinda hain”.
Last year, BJP president Amit Shah had been in Bahraich to unveil a statute of Raja Suheldeo, whom BJP leaders frequently invoke for having defeated Ghaji Salar Masood.
Matera’s SP candidate is sitting MLA Yasar Shah, considered close to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. The BJP has fielded former SP MLC Arun Veer Singh. Muslims are the single largest voting community but local BJP leaders are hopeful of a divided vote among four candidates, including the BSP’s Sultan Ahmad Khan and AIMIM’s Mohd Akiullah.
Sultan, son for former BSP MLC Athar Khan, is contesting his first election. “I am contesting on the issue of law and order. BJP leaders are trying to polarise the poll by making communal remarks but it will not work.”
In Bahraich constituency, the SP candidate is Yasar Shah’s mother Rubab Sayeda while the BJP has fielded its state general secretary Anupama Jaiswal. Sayeda, incidentally, was Anupama’s English teacher in class XI three decades ago. Sayeda is a former MP and wife of sitting SP MLA Waqar Ahmed Shah, a minister who has opted out for health reasons. The NCP, the Peace Party and the Naitik Party candidates are Muslim, as are two independents. The BSP’s Ajeet Pratap Singh is challenging the BJP’s Jaiswal.
Jaiswal denies that the BJP is trying to polarise voters in the district. “The BJP is contesting on the ideology of ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas’,” she says. She adds she wants Bahraich to shed its tag of communal sensitivity and hence is appealing for votes with a message of social harmony despite the fact that she has seen “discrimination in development on religious lines”. She says that people here have voted on communal and caste lines because of ignorance. “But in the current Narendra Modi government, people of Bahraich are seeing development of a Barabanki-Rupaideeh highway, a railway line and a medical college. People will vote on development this time,” she says.
“We need development but more important for us is social security, hence voting is done here on religious and caste lines,” says Zubair Khan of Chaupal Sagar in Bahraich.
In Nanpara, the BSP, the Congress and the Rashtriya Kranti Party have fielded Muslims against Madhuri Verma, sitting Congress MLA now with the BJP. Last time, the BSP, the Peace Party and the Trinamool Congress had fielded Muslims.
“Due to low literacy, polarisation on communal and caste lines dominated the last election despite lack of development,” says Congress candidate Waris Ali. “The BJP is trying to polarise voters by raising sensitive issues but that is not working this time because anti-incumbency against Madhuri Verma is the dominant sentiment.”
Nanpara has 3.31 lakh voters and around one lakh of them are Muslims, followed by Kurmis and Yadavs. Ali says around 50,000 of the voters are affected by floods every year.
In Mahasi, the BSP has renominated its sitting MLA K K Ojha, the BJP has fielded Sureshwar Singh and the Congress Ali Akbar, the lone Muslim candidate in a constituency where Brahmins too form a large chunk of the population. Over 30 per cent of Mahasi’s 3.28 lakh voters are Muslim.
“The BJP is trying to polarise voters along Hindu-Muslim lines with provocative remarks. Around 2,000 people have been living on an embankment since last year’s floods but no one is speaking about them,” says Akbar, who had lost from Matera in 2012. Rahul Gandhi addressed a public meeting in his support last week.
BJP candidate Singh, a former MLA, says, “We are not trying to polarise voters. The BJP is contesting on the issues of development, national security, triple talaq and other promises made in the manifesto.”
In Payagpur, sitting MLA Mukesh Srivastava, who won on a Congress ticket in 2012, is now the SP candidate. The BJP has fielded a Brahmin, Subhash Tripathi.
In Kaiserganj, the BJP candidate is sitting MLA Mukut Bihari Verma, also party president for Awadh region. The BSP and the AIMIM have fielded Muslims. The SP had earlier selected Rakesh Verma, son of Rajya Sabha member Beni Prasad Verma, but replaced him with its district president Ramtej.
A local BJP leader is optimistic about polarisation. “Some 40 people associated with the BJP were arrested following communal tension over idol immersion last year. That is still fresh in public memory,” says the leader.
In Balha (SC) bordering Nepal, the BSP has used a Dalit-Muslim formula in fielding Kiran Bharti, wife of Shaukat Khan. The couple have campaigned separately among Dalits and Muslims. Of the 3.5 lakh voters here, Muslims (90,000) and Dalits (80,000) add up to nearly half."

A five-judge constitution bench would be set up by the Supreme Court to hear and decide on a batch of petitions relating to the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims. A bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar took on record three sets of issues framed by parties with regard to the cases and said the questions for consideration of the constitution bench would be decided on March 30.

The bench, also comprising Justices N V Ramana and D V Chandrachud, said “the issues are very important. These issues cannot be scuttled”.
Referring to the legal issues framed by the Centre, it said all of them relate to the constitutional issues and needed to be dealt by a larger bench.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The bench asked the parties concerned to file their respective written submissions, running not beyond 15 pages, by the next date of hearing, besides the common paper book of case laws to be relied upon by them during the hearing to avoid duplicity.
When a woman lawyer referred to the fate of the apex court judgement in the famous Shah Bano case, the bench said “there are always two sides in a case. We have been deciding cases for last 40 years. We have to go by the law and we would not go beyond the law.”
The bench also made it clear that it is willing to sit on Saturdays and Sundays to decide on the issue as it was very important.
During the last hearing, the apex court had said it would decide the issues pertaining to ‘legal’ aspects of the practices of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims but not deal with the question whether divorce under Muslim law needs to be supervised by courts as it fell under the legislative domain.
‘Nikah halala’ means a man cannot remarry a woman after triple talaq unless she has already consummated her marriage with another man and then her new husband dies or divorces her.
The bench headed by the CJI had said “You (lawyers for parties) sit together and finalise the issues to be deliberated upon by us.”
The bench had made it clear to the parties concerned that it would not deal with the factual aspects of the particular case and would rather decide the legal issue.
The apex court had said that the question whether divorce under Muslim Personal Law needed to be supervised by either courts or by a court-supervised institutional arbitration fell under the legislative domain.
It, however, allowed lawyers to file small synopsis of cases pertaining to alleged victims of triple talaq.
The Centre had earlier opposed the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
Ministry of Law and Justice had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries.
Responding to a batch of petitions including the one filed by Shayaro Bano challenging the validity of such practices among Muslims, the Centre had first dealt with the right of gender equality under the Constitution.
All India Muslim Personal Law Board, however, had rubbished the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental rights like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
Another prominent Islamic organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind had told the court there is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law in which triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy are well rooted and stand on much higher pedestal as compared to other customs."

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday voiced his support for Uniform Civil Code and said that if matters regarding marriage and crimes are same in the country, then why should we not employ a Uniform Civil Code in the country.
Speaking at a book launch ceremony in Lucknow, Yogi said, “Chandra Shekhar ji ne kaha tha ke agar hamare faujdaari ke maamle aur shaadi vivah samaan hai to Uniform Civil Code kyun nahi? (Chandra Shekhar said that when we have similar laws regarding foreclosures and weddings, then why should not we employ an Uniform Civil Code in the country).
The UP CM also pointed fingers at those who have remained quiet on the issue and said they are equally guilty. “Some people who are silent on the issue of triple talaq are equally guilty,” he said. According to news agency PTI, Adityanath in his speech compared the practice of triple talaq with disrobing of Draupadi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The All India Muslim Board (AIMPLB) on Sunday said that the practice of triple talaq is “wrong” but is a valid way to end a marriage. The board released an eight-point code of conduct on divorces and marital disputes in a bid to change the perception that Sharia-based Muslim personal law is not prejudiced against women. It further stated that those who “misuse” the practice will face social boycott from the community.
Last week, AIMPLB told Supreme Court that sanctity of Muslim personal laws should not be altered, which prompted Yogi Adityanath to seek a reply from Muslim women groups regarding their opinion on the issues. Yogi asked the women welfare department to oversee an exercise of collecting opinion of women on the issue to be  presented to the Supreme Court."

Senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar on Monday attacked the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, calling it “un-Islamic, immoral and unconstitutional”. He also attacked those opposing construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Addressing a seminar in Delhi, he said: “It (AIMPLB) has no legal, religious, spiritual sanction…it is un-Islamic, immoral and unconstitutional…. When Muslim vote bank deserted the Congress, they caught hold of fanatic, separatist Muslim leaders…funded them and brought up this board. Those who declare it as a Muslim body, they commit a sin.”
He also termed the AIMPLB a “shaitan ki dukan (shop of evil)”. Kumar, who has worked in J&K for decades has been presenting himself as a “reformist” leader and has helped form the Muslim Rashtriya Manch.
“A reformist movement among Muslims against dogmatism and violence has taken birth (in India)…and no power of the world can stop it,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The audience was packed with several prominent personalities, including former SC Justice M Y Eqbal, former AMU V-C Mohammad Shabbir. Eqbal at one point remarked that “everyone is eager to hear Indreshji”.
About triple talaq, Kumar said that not just “triple talaq…Quran terms divorce a crime”. “What God dislikes the most is talaq. When talaq takes place on earth, the balance of paradise gets disrupted,” he said, claiming that wrong interpretation of Quran has resulted in this practice.
Speaking about the disputed site at Ayodhya, he contended that according to Islam the “place of worship should not be in the name of any person” and “must not be at a disputed place”.
“The first immorality is that it is (Babri mosque) in the name of a person….not once namaz was offered there in 400 years,” Kumar said.
Targeting China, he said: “Entire world knows that it (China) carries rakshaswaad…It opposed our (entry into) security council. It opposed Pakistan’s (declaration) as a terror state.”
While the RSS has usually been critical of China, Kumar, a member of the RSS national executive, was particularly caustic on Monday. He took a dig at China’s statement over India’s decision to invest in border areas where it said that it would spoil relations.
“Jaise ki rishton men badi khubsurati thi. China badi khubsurat chij hai jisse hamara rishta bigad jayega. (As if relations are very cordial and China is so nice to us that our relations would take a hit),” he said."

Watch what else is making news

However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her. The rights bestowed by religion can’t be questioned in a court of law, it said.
In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word “talaq” thrice as unconstitutional.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The court further observed that the triple talaq practice sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.
“Triple talaq is unconstitutional, it violates the rights of Muslim women,” ruled the High Court, adding that no personal law board is above the Constitution."
"1617716921-5","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Change in the air","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/change-in-the-air-2/","Change in the air","April 19, 2000","Pathan Shamim is a taxi driver and thinks nothing of driving for 17 hours ata stretch. She is 30-year-old divorcee, wears her hair in a plait, andsupports her son by plying her vehicle between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Shamimwas one of the Muslim women who testified at the public hearing organised bythe National Commission for Women (NCW) February. She explained why she doesnot wear a burqa: “Purdah is not about wearing a burqa; it is about modestyand dignity in one’s own eyes.”
One Shamim does not make a revolution, true. But there is no doubting thatthere are stirrings of change among India’s Muslim women as the personaltestimonies in `Voice of the Voiceless’, a recent report on the status ofMuslim women brought out the National Commission for Women, reveals. Many,like Shamim have consciously, and with a rare fortitude, rebuilt livesbroken by neglect and tragedy. Women like Sadia of Indore, who resistedtorture at the hands of her husband. Not only did she leave him and returnto her parents, she ensured that she recovered every article of her dowryfrom her husband’s home.
Questions that were never asked before are now increasingly beingarticulated. In the NCW’s public hearing at Indore, young women studentswanted to know why women have to observe purdah and men don’t. Why do weallow parents to marry their daughters when they are 14 or 15? Why are boysalways placed in front and girls pushed behind? Can we join the army whilein purdah? Why does society allow dowry atrocities on women? Why do girlsallow themselves to go to pieces if they are deserted by their husbands? Thequestions were endless. But it was a question raised by a participant inCalcutta that captured this new spirit most significantly: Why is it thatwhen other Quranic injunctions like cutting off the hands of a thief arebrushed aside on grounds of human rights and modernity, the rights of womenare not in tune with the times?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Zoya Hasan, a Delhi-based academic, who is presently working on a majorempirical survey on Muslim women across 10,000 household, along with RituMenon, co-founder of Kali, the feminist publishing house, believes that thebiggest problem facing the Muslim woman today is their lack of education andemployment.
Already there is a perceptible rise in the demand for education. AbdulWaheed, a lecturer in the department of Sociology and Social Work, AligarhMuslim University, puts it this way, “I did a field study on MuslimBanjaras in a town called Baheri, in Bareilly district. In each and everyeducational institution there, you will find Muslim girls. They may go to adegree colleges, or appear privately, but education for women is now highlyvalued something that was just not the case 20 years ago.”
Community leaders are also standing up to be counted in the drive forchange. Badar Sayeed, a Chennai-based advocate and former chairperson of theMinorities Commission of Tamil Nadu minced no words when she argued thatpolygamy should be abolished forthwith. She pointed out that there were asmany fatwas as there were ulemas, and laws needed codifcation. In Mumbai, agroup of women had even drafted a standard nikahnamah (marriagecertificate), in which a woman has the right to divorce her husband if heviolates the conditions laid out in the document.
At a public hearing organised by the Institute of Islamic Studies and Centrefor the Study of Society and Secularism held in Mumbai two years ago, theoverwhelming sentiment was that it was time for the community to stoptreating its personal law as something that is immutable.
The resolution passed at the end of this meeting told its own story: “It isresolved to open a dialogue with the Muslim Personal Law Baord in connectionwith necessary reforms in personal law as it operated today in India.” Theresolution pointed out that these laws were enacted by the British andcannot be called Shariat law in the strict sense of the term. It alsopointed to the fact that there have been instances when progressive changeshad been introduced in the law. For instance, the ulema led by MaulanaAshraf Thanvi had drafted the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939,which had given much needed relief to women whose husbands were missing.“There is need for such initiative on the part of the Muslim Personal LawBoard even today,” the resolution noted.
The irony really is that while in India Muslim women have actually beendeprived of their rights by laws like the Muslim Women (Protection of Rightson Divorce) Act, 1986, under which a divorcee cannot claim maintenance, manyIslamic nations including Pakistan and Bangladesh have effected substantivereform in Muslim personal law. In Indonesia, for instance, polygamy has beenprohibited, while in Turkey and Tunisia marriage and divorce come underregulatory legislation.
The NCW Report quotes Professor Tahir Mahmood’s study, Family Law Reforms inthe Muslim World to point out that in both Pakistan and Bangladesh, polygamycomes under the strict control of courts and administrative bodies. InPakistan, for instance, under the Family Law Ordinance 1961, polygamy is nolonger an unhindered or unchallenged right of men. The written permission ofthe first wife must be obtained before the second marriage can becontracted. Further, all marriages are registered and therefore cannot bedissolved by triple talaq. Maintenance is recognised as the right of thedivorced woman and is not limited to the iddat period, as in India.
Interestingly, in Pakistan the whole impetus for reform came from a ratherpiquant development. In 1955, news came that Prime Minister Mohammed Ali wasplanning to marry his Middle Eastern social secretary, while he was legallymarried to his first wife. Sylvia Chipp-Kraushaar, in a brief history of theAll Pakistan Women’s Association and the 1961 Muslim Family’ Laws Ordinance,included in Gail Minault The Extended Family describes how the protest bywomen over that marriage snowballed into a movement for reform of marriagelaws.
Pakistani women had argued at that time that Islam demanded “equaltreatment for all wives”, a condition that could not be logicallyfulfilled. Chipp-Kraushaar quotes a group of women social workers who hadfelt that “polygamy was permitted in Islam, not to set up harems, but tosave human beings from sin and immorality. We, however, feel that men nowfind it convenient to flout those mandatory Quranic provisions which make itnearly impossible for a man to take a second wife.”
But reforming personal law in India is bound to be a far more complexprocess, believes Imtiaz Ahmed, a professor of political sociology inJawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. “All change is a process of reformistcurrents vying with conservative ones. Given the external communalisation ofsociety, it becomes that much more difficult for the forces of reform totriumph,” he says. But he hasn’t lost hope given the manner in which womenwithin the community are mobilising for change. “They are even pressurisingthe Muslim Law Board to be allowed 33 per cent representation within it. Andin the forthcoming meeting of the Board on April 30, the question of themarriage contract is bound to come up,” says Ahmed.
He also believes that it is important for reformers to engage with theforces of orthodoxy. “Don’t end the dialogue. Keep it going,” he says."

Neeraj Priyadarshi
A DAY after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Mau that UP’s prisons are like palaces for “bahubalis”, in an indirect reference to jailed local MLA Mukhtar Ansari, BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday sought votes for the gangster-turned-politician, arguing that his victory will erase his “bahubali (muscleman)” image. “….Janata kya mafia-bahubali ko pasand karti hai? Main samajhti hun bilkul nahin karti hai aur jab woh chunav jeet jayega to Mukhtar Ansari ke oopar muhar lag jayegi… chunav jeetne ke baad… ki na woh mafia hai na woh bahubali hai (Do people like mafia and bahubali? I believe they do not… When he wins the elections, it will be certified that Mukhtar Ansari is neither a mafia nor a muscleman),” she claimed while appealing to the people to ensure Ansari’s victory with a record margin.

 
Ansari, who has been in a Lucknow jail since 2005, is facing trial for his alleged role in the murder of BJP legislator Krishnanand Rai. He was given custody parole by a trial court from February 16 to March 4 to let him campaign in the election. The Delhi High Court, however, has set aside the lower court order.
Mukhtar’s son Abbas, who is also contesting on a BSP ticket from Ghosi in the district, was present with Mayawati on the dais.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BSP chief alleged that though SP’s babua (Akhilesh Yadav) and BJP call Ansari a mafia and bahubali, the ground reality is that they support Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya — a minister in the Akhilesh government, who is contesting as an Independent from Kunda in Pratapgarh.
Maintaining that former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh had called Raja Bhaiya “Kunda ka gunda”, Mayawati said: “Maine apni sarkar mein Raghuraj Pratap Singh urf Raja Bhaiya jaise naami girami mafia va bahubali ko jail bhej diya tha… woh aaj BJP va SP ki aankh ka taara bana hua hai… jisko badnami ke dar se BJP va SP seedhe apni party se inko ticket nahin deti hai…. lekin inko parde ke peechey se jitane ke liye dono partiyan inke virudhha kamzor pratyashi khada karti rahi hain… phir vah Raghuraj Pratap Singh azad ummidwaar ke roop mein asani se har baar Sapa va BJP ki madad se jeet jata hai (During my government, I had sent known mafias and bahubalis like Raghuraj Pratap Singh to jail… He is now the blue-eyed boy of SP and BJP. To avoid criticism, SP and BJP do not give him ticket but from behind the scene, ensure his win by fielding weak candidates against him. He then easily wins as an Independent with the help of SP and BJP).”
She added: “SP’s babua has still kept Raghuraj in the Cabinet… This shows SP and BJP both are indulging in double standards when they talk about mafias and bahubalis. This is why it does not suit the PM to comment on Mukhtar’s family… A number of mafias and babhubalis and their family members are contesting election on SP and BJP tickets.”
Targeting BJP further, Mayawati said while the party could not show courage to declare a chief ministerial candidate, SP’s CM face is “tainted”. “Congress was contesting the election in alliance with SP, which is known as a symbol of anarchy, crime, corruption and jungleraj. People have to decide whether they would support SP-Congress’ tainted face or BSP’s clean face, which will remove such elements and establish the rule of law,” she added.
Taking on the PM, Mayawati said Modi was “enacting a drama by calling himself the adopted son of UP”. “The drama will not work and the people would not give their blessing to the BJP. They have decided to bless their own daughter (khud ke beti) in the elections,” she added. Mayawati went on to say that she does not agree with BJP and the Centre’s attempts to interfere in Muslim personal law, triple talaq and uniform civil code.
“Mau falls in eastern UP… When people from the region go to Mumbai to earn their livelihood, they face step-motherly treatment from the BJP and Shiv Sena,” Mayawati said while appealing to the people to take

revenge.
“SP will have to be on oxygen support after results are declared… I am sure the family of Mukhtar Ansari and Afzal Ansari (Mukhtar’s brother) would bring SP towards oxygen support in eastern UP,” she claimed.
The BSP chief added: “Waise bhi inke sabhi varishtha netaon ke chehre ka noor utarne laga hai. Chuvan mein BJP ke guru Narendra Modi va unka chela Amit Shah ke saath-saath yahan SP ke babua ke tsunami wale kaafi bure din aane wale hain… khas kar ab is Sapa ke babua ko to Sapa ki bhabhi bhi nahi bacha sakti hain (Anyway, the glow on the faces of their senior leaders is fading. In the elections, alongwith BJP’s guru Narendra Modi and his disciple, SP’s son will face tsunami… and SP’s sister-in-law will also not be able to save SP’s son).”
On Akhilesh’s repeated remarks on elephant statues that were erected during the previous BSP government, Mayawati said that this way, the CM was publicising BSP’s symbol more than cycle (SP symbol)."

Somebody may choose to call it organised loot, but if Rs 18,6000 crore lost in the Coalgate scam or Rs 17,6000 crore lost in the 2G scam and other scams like the Common Wealth Games, and AugustaWestland were not organised loot, then I don’t know what was. Prime Minister Modi has come to this decision with a great deal of thought and with a commitment to cleanse Indian society of black money, corruption, and dangers of counterfeit notes, which fuel terrorism and drug cartels. It is probably the largest action taken in the history of mankind. One of the biggest impact that we hope this move will have is on the mindset of people. The chalta hai approach has to change some day. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a nation as large as India to think differently, to try and leave behind a legacy for the youth of India, which is different from the one we inherited. We would like the colour of currency to be one. We would like the transactions to be in one currency, one legal format.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On the expected drop in the growth of GDP
In the short run, there will be a drop. Some of the things that amazed us was that two-wheeler and car sales have dropped. I can’t imagine that cars and two-wheelers were also being sold in cash or were being sold with illegitimate money. That fall in the sale is what we call short-term pain. But, if we move towards an economy where everybody starts buying two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers with honest money, that’s the change we are trying to bring. I think in the long-term, we can clearly see lower inflation, lower interest rates beat improved investment climate. A lot of international foreign firms would love to come to a country where business is done honestly.
On the transition to a cashless economy
When you are talking about a cashless society, you are aiming at one which is near cashless. Currently in India, we have about 71 crore debit cards and 26 million credit cards. Over 450 million of them are used only for withdrawing cash from an ATM. Hardly 45-50 million are used for transacting through that debit card. It’s an unfortunate situation. Each cash transaction costs Rs 55 to Rs 70. So if we see nation as a whole, there is a potential of Rs 20,000-plus crore saving if we are able to convert a large part of our transactions to digital. Lastly, honest payment of taxes — a society where traders, businessmen, industrialists, everybody has equal opportunity. So your ability to succeed in a competitive world is not judged by how much tax you evade but is determined by your service quality, your product quality. I think that’s the kind of society digital payments can bring about.

On transparency in political finance
When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was law minister in the NDA government 12-13 years ago, he had brought in an amendment to the Income-Tax Act and to the Companies Act by which he allowed corporates to give political donations by cheque up to 5 per cent of their average net profit of the previous three years to any political party, provided it was an Indian company. And every rupee you donated by cheque, gave you 100 per cent tax deduction. In the last session of Parliament, we liberalised it further. Recognising that we now have a large number of companies that have foreign investments, we said that any Indian company, can donate up to 7.5 per cent of its net gain, after a tax average of the last three years. Now to my mind, every conscientious citizen (individuals can get 100 per cent tax deduction on the amount donated), corporates, companies, and businessmen should understand that a good political system, a good political leader and a good political party is good for our lives.

On the secrecy, alleged lack of preparedness 
There was no way we could have sorted all the preparations because then it would have leaked out and would have had no impact really. I don’t know how many people knew about it. Certainly it came as a shocker to me and my colleagues, except for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Some Opposition leaders may suggest otherwise, but I can reassure you that proper processes were followed. Having said that, to keep it secret was bound to cause some pain. It is very easy to say we could have printed more notes. Super smart chartered accountants could have cracked it immediately. The business community is even smarter, they would have caught on to it. Forget all of that. Imagine keeping a secret from the media, that’s even more difficult. I will tell you a small secret. In 2014, when the Cabinet was announced, there was a lot of speculation but nobody could get the names right. In the past, we have always had Cabinet lists leaked. This time, not a single person knew. No typed list was ever made. The power was with one leader, one man. Nobody could dictate to him, be it a journalist or a corporate bigwig or an extraconstitutional authority. The PM has again and again demonstrated tremendous ability to keep official secrets.

On the success of GST after demonetisation
If at all one looks at the framework of GST, it could never have been successful if we allowed a parallel currency and a parallel trade to continue and flourish. It’s important to create a level-playing field where everybody pays the same taxes, then tax rates can also come down. So GST will actually be more successful after the demonetisation move. We have large teams already working on the network (GSTN) which will run the GST story. Given that we expect to get good tax collection or money which never comes back into the system, I feel it will help the government give good stimuli to the economy, and look at measures to improve health facilities, education, public welfare activities for the deprived sections of society, all of which will help India go towards a more inclusively, prosperous society.
On UP elections and a possible JDU-BJP alliance
When my esteemed colleague Naresh Agarwal (Samajwadi Party leader) said that this move has been made keeping UP elections in mind, I asked him, ‘Have you already given up?’ If you are saying that it’s a bad move, then you should be happy. If you are saying that it’s done looking at UP elections where we are the frontrunners, then obviously you accept the fact that people of India are happy with this. I am glad Nitish Kumar has realised that the people of India support this move. He has shown that he is able to take a decision which may not be politically palatable (by opposing the Bharat bandh) but which is in the interest of India. On an alliance possibility, that should be posed to Nitishji. But I have always thought that will be one marriage which will be very rocky. About it happening in the near future, well, we are opposed to triple talaq. But an honourable divorce, if the situation so desires, is permitted in the Constitution of India.

On the way PM Modi functions
He is probably the most non-interfering leader that I have worked with. He has an ability to come up with out-of-the-box suggestions. Once I had gone to discuss with him the coal block auctions. I told him that I will take 90 days from the day of opening of tender to its completion. He asked me ‘Why do you need 90 days?’ I told him it was a complicated project and required me to be careful and maintain transparency. He said, ‘So if you will do it in 30 days, will it become a dishonest project?’ He is a man in a hurry to see a prosperous India.
On regrets as the government reaches its half-way term
Every single day we get up with a lot of regrets, a lot of things which we could have done better. I think the day we stop regretting, the day we feel we have done enough, we will be finished. The next two-and-a-half years are going to be dedicated to giving a big boost to economic activity, industrial activity, growth to manufacturing, and creating new jobs in the economy. We are going to try and convert India into a digital world so that we can look at a cashless economy.
On dealing with criticism
Constructive criticism is something that I value, my Prime Minister values, our government values. If we commit a mistake, we will apologise. We will also come before the people and accept their verdict. But if a journalist tries to coach people into saying wrong things or play in loop a single criticism of demonitisation whilst ignoring the vast majority who is in favour of it, we will surely protest. If the Opposition criticises this move calling it shock therapy and demands people be given seven days to change their black money into white, certainly we are going to ask them ki aap bhrashtachar, kale dhan aur atankvaad ke saath khare ho ya jo saaf karne ki yojna hai, uske saath (do you support corruption, black money and terrorism or this movement to clean this up)?"

(File)
Kerala BJP Tuesday hit out at the CPI(M), heading the ruling LDF in the state, for “opposing” the Uniform Civil Code, accusing the party of “following appeasement politics”.
“Opposing the Uniform Civil Code and ‘triple talaq’ is the CPI(M)’s double standard and an attempt to strengthen communal polarisation by minority appeasement,” BJP state general secretary K Surendran told a press conference here.

Efforts were needed to put an end to male dominance in all the religions and the CPI(M)’s “propaganda” that the Uniform Civil Code was against the Muslim community amounted to “minority appeasement” and would only help strengthen “communal polarisation”, he alleged.

The attitude of denouncing late CPI(M) veteran EM Shankaran Namboothripad, who was in favour of the Uniform Civil Code, was part of the party’s “vote-bank politics”, said Surendran.
“The CPI(M) is trying to tighten its bound with the communal outfits ahead of the Assembly polls in some of the states,” he alleged.
Taking on the Congress-led UDF, the BJP leader alleged that both the fronts in Kerala were “competing with each other in minority appeasement”.
He also criticised the stand of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a partner in the UDF, for objecting to a NIA probe at Peace International School in Kochi, against which a case has been registered for teaching “objectionable” content.
The previous UDF government in the state had taken a “favourable” stand towards the school due to “pressure” from the IUML, he claimed.
“The IUML’s attitude is that teaching fundamentalism is not a crime but investigating it is a crime. This is strange,” said Surendran."

The Supreme Court on Thursday said a five-judge constitution bench would sit in May to decide on pleas relating to aspects of triple talaq. The apex court will also frame issues on March 30 regarding triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy in Muslims for consideration. “Triple talaq is an important issue, it can’t be scuttled,” observed the SC.

Referring to the legal issues framed by the Centre, it said all of them relate to the constitutional issues and needed to be dealt by a larger bench. The bench asked the parties concerned to file their respective written submissions, running not beyond 15 pages, by the next date of hearing, besides the common paper book of case laws to be relied upon by them during the hearing to avoid duplicity.

When a woman lawyer referred to the fate of the apex court judgement in the famous Shah Bano case, the bench said “there are always two sides in a case. We have been deciding cases for last 40 years. We have to go by the law and we would not go beyond the law.” The bench also made it clear that it is willing to sit on Saturdays and Sundays to decide on the issue as it was very important.
Clarifying its stand on Wednesday, the apex court had said it would decide issues pertaining to only the legal aspects of the practices of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims but would not be debating the Uniform Civil Code. “We will not be debating Uniform Civil Code,” said a bench led by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar, while rejecting an attempt by a lawyer to raise the issue. “We are not interested in facts, only in the propositions of law,” he said.
The bench, also comprising Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud added: “This could be a human rights issue… you (lawyers for parties) sit together and finalise the issues to be deliberated upon by us. We are listing it day after tomorrow for deciding the issues.” The bench observed that the question whether divorce under Muslim Personal Law needs to be supervised by either courts or by a court-supervised institutional arbitration falls under the legislative domain. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), however, had rubbished the stand taken by the government that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental rights like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

THE ALL India Shia Personal Law Board has asked the central government to enact a law to ban triple talaq and declared its support for a ban on cow slaughter across the country. The board has also endorsed the Supreme Court’s suggestion to settle the Ayodhya dispute out of court amicably.
These were among the resolutions passed during a meeting in Lucknow Wednesday of around 150 executive members of the board from across the country .
A board member said that the support for a cow-slaughter ban was based on a fatwa issued by a Shia cleric in Iraq, Maulana Ayatollah Basheer Najafi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We got that fatwa from Iraq, according to which cows should not be killed because the issue concerns the religious sentiments of Hindus. Hence, a prohibition on it should be implemented effectively,” said Maulana Ejaz Athar, speaking on behalf of the board.
Athar said that the board members will take measures to spread awareness among the Muslim community about the fatwa.
“A similar fatwa against cow slaughter had been issued by a Shia cleric in India as well, around 40 or 50 years ago. As per the resolution passed at that time, a person should follow the laws of the country where he lives,” he said.
On triple talaq, Athar said, the board resolved to ask the Centre to enact a law to prohibit the practice so that married Muslim women and their rights could be protected. The board will present its opinion in the Supreme Court, too, said Athar, while claiming that there was no mention of triple talaq in the Quran.
Besides, he said, the Shia board welcomed the recent observation of the Supreme Court that described the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri mosque dispute as a “sensitive” and “sentimental” issue and suggested that the issue should be settled amicably.
Athar said the board will appeal to both parties in the case to hold talks to resolve the issue peacefully.
When it was pointed out that the board’s resolutions appeared to favour the stance adopted by various Hindutva groups on these issues, Athar said the Shia body has been raising them for several decades.
“The meeting was called to discuss these proposals because triple talaq and cow slaughter are burning issues these days and the board wanted to communicate its opinion to the masses,” said Athar.
“The board also decided to demand that the central government form a separate commission to prepare a report on the economic, educational and political condition of Shia Muslims in the country, on the lines of Sachar Committee for Muslims,” said Athar.
“The board’s view is that the rights given by the Centre to Muslims as minorities do not reach the 5 crore members of the Shia community,” he said.
According to Athar, the board has expressed happiness over the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh inducting a Shia Muslim, Mohsin Raza, as minister.
The board further demanded representation to Shia Muslims, according to their population, on the boards of madrasas, said Athar.
Another demand raised by the board was that the Central Haj Committee should arrange Shia clerics for Shia Muslims going for Haj, he said."

UP cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya has charged that Muslims use triple talaq to change wives and satisfy their “lust”, remarks that are likely to spur a controversy. The BJP minister’s comments come at a time when there is a raging debate over the issue of triple talaq. Maurya said triple talaqs have no basis.
“BJP stands with Muslim women who have been given talaq unreasonably and arbitrarily,” Maurya, who was here to participate in a function at the house of a local BJP leader here, told news persons Friday night.
“These talaqs have no basis…. if someone only for satisfying his lust keeps changing his wives and forces his own wife and children on the streets to beg… no one will call this as right”, he said.
Maurya said BJP stands with such victims to help them get respect."

The issue of triple talaq in one sitting has once again become a subject of heated discussion. Many Muslims continue to oppose the argument that uttering the word talaq in one sitting cannot dissolve a Muslim marriage. This is because triple talaq in one sitting as constituting an irrevocable divorce has been the position of many (though not all) of the scholars affiliated with the four major schools of Sunni jurisprudence for centuries.
Some Muslims incorrectly believe that any rule whose origin is from outside the four schools of Sunni jurisprudence is prohibited, and that is why they oppose the argument for making three talaqs in one sitting to be counted as just one. However, this concept has no authentic foundation in Islamic jurisprudence. In Sunni jurisprudential history, there are many instances of practices which were followed earlier by others and were later adopted by the Sunni ulema or scholars of Islamic jurisprudence due to changes in socio-historical circumstances.
Since the period of the companions of Prophet Muhammad, a considerable number of Muslim scholars and jurists have insisted that if a Muslim husband utters the word talaq three times in one sitting, it constitutes one talaq. According to Ibn ul-Qayyim (d.1350), the Islamic jurist and theologian, some noted companions of the Prophet such as Ali (the fourth Caliph of the Sunni Muslims), Abdullah bin Masood, Abdullah bin Abbas, Zubair bin Awwam and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, viewed the utterance of the word talaq in one sitting as one, not three, and, thus, as not resulting in an irrevocable divorce (al-talaq ul-mughallaza).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When formulating the law about divorce, it appears that the Quran tends to restrain quick divorce since it clearly suggests that “a divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold together on equitable terms or separate with kindness.” (2:229)

According to this verse, there must be room for retaining the wife after uttering the word talaq. This would not be possible if triple talaq in one sitting were considered irrevocable. It seems illogical and unnatural that a marital relationship of, say, 30 years breaks off within 30 seconds, without leaving a chance for reconciliation. The Quran (4:22) refers to the agreement which a husband and a wife pledge together as a ‘strong covenant’, and obviously, that cannot be so vulnerable and easily broken by a one-sided decision taken in a state of anger or depression.
Those who claim that three talaqs in one sitting count only as one, and not three — and so does not result in the end of a Muslim marriage — infer their opinion from a hadith recorded in the Sahih Muslim, a collection of hadith reports widely respected among Sunni Muslims. According to this report, Abdullah bin Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, said that triple talaq in one sitting was considered as one in the period of the Prophet, the period of the first caliph Abu Bakr, and during the early years of the second caliph Umar (Sahih Muslim, 1482).
Another tradition relates that a companion of the Prophet, Rukanah bin Yazid, divorced his wife thrice in one sitting. He then regretted what he had done and approached the Prophet. The Prophet asked him how he had divorce his wife. Rukanah answered that he had done so by pronouncing the word talaq thrice. The Prophet asked him if he had pronounced it in a single sitting, to which he replied in the affirmative. The Prophet then said that it had the effect of one divorce and that if he wanted to take his wife back he could.
Defenders of triple talaq in one sitting often cite the enforcement of this practice by Umar, the second Caliph. In response, it can be said that this was intended for the welfare of society in that particular socio-historical context. Umar thought it an appropriate ruling as men had made talaq a joke by taking back their wives even after uttering the word talaq several times, because of which their wives had to suffer, being stuck in a vicious circle and not being able to gain their freedom.
The issue of triple talaq is a sensitive one. Traditionalist Muslim scholars wrongly regard even the slightest deviation from the opinion of their school as unlawful. On the other hand, are the thousands upon thousands of Muslim women whose lives are being destroyed by the effects of this method of divorce.
It is incumbent upon Muslims to find a balanced solution to this in accordance with the teachings and spirit of Islam. Muslims must take initiatives for the reform of the practice of talaq. This reform needs to happen at the level of laws.
Many Muslim-majority countries have reformed their laws and consider three talaqs in one sitting to be just one. Indian Muslims must come forth to support this sort of reform, realising that it is essential for their own welfare."

With a five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court set to start a hearing on the constitutional validity of instantaneous triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) in May, the Law Commission has decided to hold in abeyance its own report on the matter till the apex court gives its final orders. Law Commission chairperson Justice B S Chauhan, however, has said that the Commission would be definitely looking at the issue of Uniform Civil Code.
“We are looking at the Uniform Civil Code, that is our reference, to look into what is possible within the framework of the Constitution,” Chauhan told The Indian Express. He added that the Commission is taking its time to tabulate the 40,000-odd responses and will only take up the issue in another two months or so, after the matter is settled in the court. Based on a directive from the Law Ministry, the Law Commission had issued its questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code on October 7, the day on which the Modi government filed its affidavit in the apex court supporting Shayara Bano’s plea for ban on talaq-e-bidat. Back then, the Law Commission had maintained that it was looking at reform of personal laws across religions and not just a Uniform Civil Code.
“Once the matter is argued before the Supreme Court, many issues of Constitutional or religious nature will be raised and that may help us, so we are going slow. If the court holds that you cannot interfere in religious matters, it will be binding on us. We do not want a situation where we take a view and the Supreme Court takes a contrary view,” Chauhan said. He added that while several political parties have already written to the Law Commission, many others that were silent in view of the UP elections are now expected to write in.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The issue of Uniform Civil Code, which has always been part of the BJP’s election manifesto, has re-entered the political discourse with renewed vigour after the UP elections. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have recently spoken out against the practice of triple talaq with the latter even going to the extent of presenting the Uniform Civil Code as the solution to ending the gender discriminatory practice.
Recently, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which has always held that instantaneous triple talaq is wrong in practice and yet valid in law, met the Law Commission to voice its objection to any kind of state interference in the Shariat. “They (AIMPLB) said that they have signatures of over 1 crore Muslim women who say that they do not want any change in the practice. I told them that the matter is subjudice and, hence, it is not proper for us to discuss the issue. They handed over some papers to us which we will open only after the case is over before the Supreme Court,” said Chauhan."

I am the only woman among the 41 members),’’ says Naseem Iqtidar, minutes before boarding the Swarn Shatabdi Express to attend the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s executive committee meeting in Kanpur tomorrow.
Puzzled and circumspect, Naseem makes it clear to those who are expecting radical decisions at tomorrow’s meeting that the issue of banning the triple talaq does not even figure in the agenda, let alone plans to scrap it.

‘‘Item no. 1: Reading of Quran Sharif. Item no. 2: Paying of condolences. Item no. 3 …,’’ rattles off the 75-year-old, reading out the entire agenda written in Urdu.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
‘‘Shariat has codified the provision of the triple talaq. Thus, it cannot be changed. What we can do is highlight the Shariat’s teaching that the triple talaq is bad,’’ Naseem says. ‘‘We can raise any issue with the permission of the chair, but the triple talaq practice cannot be challenged. Only its ills can be highlighted.”

A doctorate in Urdu, Naseem appears quite resigned to issues relating to women’s rights. ‘‘The board has codified the Shariat and Page 128 of that book says a provision should be included in the Nikahanama, saying the husband gives his wife a right to divorce…A silent revolution is on, but the board’s stamp would make it known to even the lesser-educated.’’ In the last governing body meeting in 2000, a new Nikahanama had drafted this clause. ‘‘Even ulemas had endorsed addition of this clause to the Nikahanama. But our women members had objected to the inclusion of such a clause,’’ Naseem says.

Naseem can only hope that in tomorrow’s meet, the newly-drafted Nikahanama will at least propose women’s right to divorce. ‘‘I hate to give Pakistan’s example, but even Shariat codified by the Pak ulemas recognise women’s right to divorce,’’ she adds.

Drafting model Nikahanama

The spokesperson of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Qasim Rasool Ilyas, says the board will put up a draft of the model Nikahanama, which will apprise a Muslim couple of their respective rights at the time of marriage. ‘‘If the couple has a dispute, the new Nikahanama suggests they should avoid taking a unilateral decision and go to the Darul-Qaza for redressal.’’

The new Nikahanama also proposes to increase the Mehr amount. A five-member committee of Islamic scholars recognises that a Muslim woman has a right to khula."

But when basic journalistic ethics are given the go-by even while a facade of objectivity and even-handedness is diligently maintained, when insinuation is paraded as argument, when facts are selectively handpicked to dress up fiction, Ms Singh’s bluff needs to be called.
In her recent column ‘The communalism divide’ (The Sunday Express, Nov 21), the prime target of Ms Singh’s wrath are ‘‘magazines and NGOs who have thrived on maligning India for being a country as fundamentalist as our Islamic neighbours’’. Ms Singh’s ‘‘anti-national’’ magazines and NGOs remain nameless and faceless, with the sole exception of Communalism Combat, the monthly magazine that we co-edit. But even here, instead of holding her ground as an honest critic, she stoops to the hit-and-run tactics of cowardly journalism.

Before writing her column, Ms Singh e-mailed us a list of ‘‘harsh questions’’. They added up to the charge that we are a shady, unregistered outfit (NGO), accountable to no one, funded by ‘‘Saudis of a dubious nature’’ for publishing a magazine that cries itself hoarse over Muslim victims of communal violence but keeps silent over the plight of Kashmiri Pandits and the victims of the anti-Sikh carnage in 1984.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
We give a detailed reply to all the questions. We categorically state that the magazine or its editors do not have a single petro-dollar to hide, that Communalism Combat is not an NGO activity but is published by a registered, private limited company whose audited annual accounts are regularly filed with the Income Tax and other authorities. In addition, we attach a specially-prepared list of headlines of cover stories and special reports published by Communalism Combat since its launch in August 1993, so that Ms Singh could see for herself that the magazine has been as unsparing of Muslim communalism and extremism, lamented the fact that the victims of the anti-Sikh carnage of 1984 had been denied justice, frequently highlighted the plight of Kashmiri Pandits, and repeatedly castigated Bangladesh and Pakistan for the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities. (We would be happy to e-mail a copy of the list to all interested readers of The Indian Express). We also inform Ms Singh that she is welcome to access archives on our website, sabrang.com.

It is obvious in retrospect that Ms Singh was merely interested in those bits of facts that suited her thesis, the rest she would twist or fabricate.

‘‘In the vanguard of those fighting Hindu fundamentalism was Teesta Setalvad’s magazine, Communalism Combat….’’ Excuse us. Ms Singh is entitled to her opinion of us and of our magazine, but what gives her the right to distort facts? Did she not owe it her own professional integrity to share with her readers the information (fact) that the editors she accuses of being concerned with fighting Hindu fundamentalism alone, among other things, co-hosted the visit of Taslima Nasreen to Mumbai in March 2000, kept her at their own home, arranged public meetings and interviews for her, in support of her right to be heard and in defiance of Muslim fanatics who had threatened to burn Taslima alive if she dared enter the metropolis?

CC was the perhaps the first publication in South Asia to feature the inhuman and oppressive politics of the Taliban in Afghanistan (‘Hell on Earth’, cover story, November 1998). It was up front, questioning the Islamisation of the movement in Kashmir (‘The Talibanisation of Kashmir’, cover story, November 1999). ‘Living with Terror, Minorities in Bangladesh’, our cover story for September 2004, is only the latest in half-a-dozen cover stories and special reports that we have featured in the last few years to highlight atrocities against Hindus and other minorities in neighbouring Bangladesh.

‘‘Teesta Setalvad’s magazine, Communalism Combat….’’ Elementary journalistic courtesy would have required her to point out the fact that CC is co-edited. But Teesta needed to be singled out so that she could be ‘‘exposed’’ immediately thereafter: ‘‘Teesta’s protege Zaheera Shaikh condemned her for exploiting her for money.’’

The choice of words (protege) is telling. Why was Zaheera’s allegation not part of the list of charges and queries against us for our version? Shouldn’t Ms Singh have informed her readers that within days of Zaheera’s allegation, it is not she but Teesta who has applied to the Supreme Court praying for a probe into the murky episode? Zaheera has rushed her complaints to the National Commission for Minorities and National Commission for Women but is fighting shy of going near the National Human Rights Commission, the only among the three commissions to be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India. Does this not arouse Ms Singh’s journalistic curiosity?

‘‘Communalism is an odd subject to make a profit out of’’. We gave Ms Singh a fair picture of how profitable communalism has been for us in the last 11 years. Why she has chosen to keep that a personal secret only she can answer. We started Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd in the hope of undertaking professional assignments that would generate revenue to sustain Communalism Combat, which we foresaw as not being viable on its own strength. What, prey, is so odd about that?

Having distorted facts and employed clever words to make insinuations against the only two persons and their magazine she names in her entire column, Ms Singh pretends her column is not actually about them! How ingenious! Her column, she says, is about ‘‘anti-national’’ magazines and NGOs ‘‘who have thrived on maligning India for being a country as fundamentalist as our Islamic neighbours’’. Having adopted a hit-and-run tactics vis-a-vis us, Ms Singh can proceed to hurl the most outrageous charges without any fear of contradiction for she smartly names no names.

We need only repeat the plaint of fellow journalists in recent years: ‘‘Please don’t shoot the messenger!’’ If with their ‘‘What face will I show to the world?’’ and ‘‘Gujarat is a blot on the nation!’’ even Vajpayee and Advani have been forced to acknowledge Narendra Modi’s malevolent role in maligning India, why is Ms Singh chasing imaginary ghosts?

The timing of her demand for an inquiry into NGOs and their source of funds is interesting, echoing as it does Modi’s demand immediately after Zaheera’s fresh turnaround under the protection of the Gujarat police. The Gujarat Chief Minister’s desperation is understandable. Be it the deposition of top IPS officials before the Nanavati Commission, or the evidence piling up before the courts, or the ongoing expose in the very paper that provides you with precious column space, things are getting hotter by the day for Modi. A desperate man will take desperate steps. What’s your problem, Ms Singh? Don’t be so naive as to write such a premature obit for Hindutva. And can’t you see that the best way to fight terrorism, Islamic or otherwise, is to fight against injustice. That is all that we are trying our best to do, through Communalism Combat and otherwise. Pick a forum of your choice for an honest debate but deviousness does not befit a journalist like you.

The Congress party has advised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not to drag the triple talaq issue to Court, as Muslims can resolve it on their own.
“Let Muslims solve the problem of triple talaq on their own. Why is the BJP dragging this to court. One should not interfere more in this matter. The BJP is trying to create an adverse agitating situation,” Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plea for respecting the Muslim women was correct.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi said, “Our Muslim sisters deserve justice. We should try to solve this issue at the district level. We should also proceed on the formula of a new India. We can’t simply move forward at a slow pace, but charge ahead with full speed.” During a discussion on the national commission for backward classes, Prime Minister Modi at the BJP National Executive meeting in Bhubaneswar, Odisha suggested that the party should hold conferences for ‘backward’ Muslims.
A five-judge constitution bench of the apex court will start hearing from May 11 the petitions against triple talaq."

In an order granting supremacy to parliamentary laws over personal laws of religious groups, the Supreme Court Thursday ruled that divorce decrees passed by ecclesiastical tribunals under the canon law will have no validity and that Christian couples must abide by the statutory law to have their marriages legally annulled.
The court order, which dismissed a three-year-old PIL filed by Clarence Pais, an advocate and a former president of the Catholic Association of Dakshina Kannada in Karnataka, may also have a bearing on a clutch of petitions that have sought declaring triple talaq as unconstitutional and illegal.
Demanding legal recognition of the canon law, Pais had sought to draw a parallel with legal sanctity being granted to the oral triple talaq for Muslims.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

But a bench led by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar dismissed the petition filed by Pais, and invoked a judgment holding that parliamentary laws shall override personal laws and that “statutory provisions shall prevail and override any personal law”.
Pais wanted the Supreme Court to put its stamp of approval on the decrees of divorce and other such decrees issued by an ecclesiastical court or tribunal. An ecclesiastical tribunal or a church court, set up under the canon law, is an institution for Catholics.
The bench, also comprising Justice D Y Chandrachud, however, said that the petition was “devoid of merit” and deserved to be dismissed in view of the 1996 judgment which had settled the law on the point of marriage and divorce among Christians. The court said that a divorce decree can be passed only by a district court or a high court, authorised under the Divorce Act.
Declining a plea by the petitioner’s advocate to adjourn the hearing of the matter, the bench said that the PIL lacked merit after what the apex court said in its 1996 ruling and would be dealt with right away.
“When legislature enacts a law even in respect of the personal law of a group of persons following a particular religion, then such statutory provisions shall prevail and override any personal law, usage or custom prevailing before coming into force of such Act,” the 1996 judgment had said while dealing with a similar issue on the ecclesiastical court.
The two-judge bench of the Supreme Court had declared that power to grant divorce “has been vested either in the district court or the high court” and “there is no scope for any other authority including ecclesiastical tribunal (Church Court) to exercise power in connection with matrimonial matters which are covered by the provisions of the Divorce Act.”
Citing this judgment, the bench rejected the plea to ratify decrees of dissolution of marriage granted by an ecclesiastical court and to grant immunity from criminal prosecution to Roman Catholics under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code for the offence of bigamy.

With this order, the apex court also rejected an argument made by Pais’s lawyer and former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee that canon law decrees have to be made binding on courts of law since triple talaq has been accorded legal sanctity for granting divorce to Muslim couples.
The petition was opposed by the central government which maintained that since the power for dissolution of marriage has been vested in the court, there is no scope for any other authority, including an ecclesiastical tribunal, to exercise such power.
Additional Solicitor General Neeraj K Kaul submitted before the bench on Thursday that the issue was squarely covered by the 1996 judgment and no further indulgence should be shown to the petitioner. He pointed out that Parliament has enacted the Christian Marriage Act and Divorce Act to deal with matrimonial issues and no other forum could now be given parallel authority.
During a previous hearing of this petition, the apex court had said that India is a secular country today but it is not sure for how long it will stay that way. The court also stressed that religious decrees cannot override the written code of law. “India till now is a secular country. we don’t know for how long it will remain a secular country. We have to stamp out religion from civil laws. It is very necessary. There are already too many problems,” the court had observed."

Both the options for divorce — triple talaq in one sitting and the other in which divorce is formalised in three sittings, each sitting separated by three months — are permitted under the shariat but experience has shown that the practice of triple talaq has often been misused by Muslim men.
‘‘The AIMPLB cannot change the shariat law. At best, it can focus on the ills of the triple talaq and introduce deterrent measures,’’ said Zafaryab Jilani, legal advisor to the Board.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, this proposal was not on the agenda of the Law Board’s annual meeting in Kanpur on July 4 but with some members insisting, it now finds place. With the nikahnaama in Arabic, the basic purpose of attaching a note in Urdu is to spread the word. It can also be translated into other languages. ‘‘The Board cannot ban or abolish the system of triple talaq, one of the practices of divorce being followed for the last 1400 years,’’ Jilani pointed out.
Muslim women are at the receiving end of this practice. Even if a man, influence by liquor, were to utter talaq, talaq talaq, he divorces his wife.
Begum Naseem Iqtidar Ali, the only female member of the executive committee of the Law Board, wanted the Board to adopt a proposal for a provision in the nikahnaama which gives a woman the right to divorce her husband. This, she said, could be within the framework of the shariat.
‘‘Aurat ko bhi tafviz-e-talaq ka haq haasil hona chahiye (a woman too should have the right to divorce),’’ she said. Ali said the proposal was in the codified Muslim personal laws brought out by the AIMPLB in 2001. Law Board members have been divided on the two issues."

The practice of triple talaq for divorcing a Muslim woman and the freedom extended to Muslim males to practise polygamy were in some quarters regarded as violation of the dignity of Muslim women and also discriminatory. These two features of Muslim Personal Law were some of the sticking points to the enactment of Uniform Civil Code as contemplated by Article 44 of the Directive Principles of our Constitution. According to press reports,a group of Muslim scholars and activists have made a valiant attempt towards codification of Muslim Personal Law. The national consultation on codification has prepared a progressive draft which among other things bans triple talaq and restricts polygamy. According to the reformist scholar Asghar Ali Engineer,the group is not bringing any new law but only reiterating the provisions which the Quran makes for Muslim men and women. Qutub Jehan Kidwai of the Mumbai based Institute of Islamic Studies was emphatic that there is no place for triple talaq in one seating and that  it must be abolished. The Quranic verses which are relied upon in justification of the liberty given to Muslim males to take up to four wives,on a proper interpretation clearly says that males cannot do adequate justice to all four wives and,therefore,should marry just one woman. The draft document also makes registration of all Muslim marriages with the state governments mandatory and further provides that consent of the bride be made mandatory and the minimum age of the bride should be 18 and that of the groom 21. Some of these provisions will no doubt generate controversies but they clearly reflect a progressive trend. It is hoped that forces of sanity will ultimately prevail which will better the lot of Muslim women and ensure them a life of dignity.
Morality in Communist China
Religion is the opium of the people. That is the invincible dogma of the Chinese Communist State. Nevertheless Chinese people are guided by moral considerations in their daily life and do not condone moral lapses of their fellow citizens. There is the example of a restaurant owner in central China who has refused to entertain customers who bring mistresses along or those who have failed to take care of their ageing parents. The owner is a Peoples Liberation Army veteran. He has put a board in front of his hotel stating that it does not serve people who do not show filial piety,those who have mistresses and those who spend public money for private purposes. Quite a long list. The aim is laudable. But there will be problems in enforcing the Moral Code. What are the criteria for determining whether women brought to the eatery are mistresses or close friends? There is a thin dividing line between mistresses and close lady friends. And in practice,the line would often get blurred. The owner of the eatery is aware of these problems. He also knows that there will be a drop in his income. But he regards his move as an insistence that people abide by the principles of being a righteous man.
Jazz at the White House
Jazz is undoubtedly a part of American culture,indeed its heritage. Of late,jazz musicians are officially admired and honoured by requests to play in the White House. Erroll Garner gave a brilliant piano recital a couple of decades ago. Other veteran jazz musicians have also performed. President Bill Clinton is a jazz aficionado and also plays the tenor sax. Going through President Jimmy Carters White House Diary,I found this interesting bit. We had Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan give an excellent jazz concert. Earl Fatha Hines went up to play two pieces and almost stole the show. The big event was held on the South lawn. Carter records that he went on the stage with Dizzy Gillespie and joined him in a rendition of Salt Peanuts. He confesses that it was a high point in my life when The New York Times complimented my singing! Quite right Mr President. You have the right priorities."

Although the AIMPLB tried to hardsell the result as an elaborate marriage documentation that safeguards Muslim women’s rights, doubts persist over its implementation given that the nikahnamah is not mandatory.

The nikahnamah, which had earlier been accepted by the executive council at the Lucknow meet, was given the go-ahead by the AIMPLB’s general council, which met here for three days. ‘‘There were no differences and it was accepted within 10 minutes,’’ said Maulana Saeed Nizamuddin, general secretary, AIMPLB.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Claiming that the model nikahnamah was an elaborate document, the Maulana said it contains a set of guidelines for those entering a marital contract and tries to avert, if not eliminate, the process of triple talaq (divorce). ‘‘The document clearly states that unless inevitable, triple talaq should be avoided,’’ he said.

‘‘But if the separation is unavoidable, the intervention of senior family members should be sought to thrash out a solution. But if that does not work, the couple should approach the shariat court,’’ the Maulana said.

The nikahnamah suggests that for separation, the only option is to approach shariat courts.

However, asked what would happen if couples refuse to stick to the nikahnamah in case of separation, the Maulana said: ‘‘It is a hypothetical question and I don’t want to reply to that.’’



 

Model nikahnamah








 

 • Avoid triple talaq—if inevitable,               approach Shariat courts 
               • Make nikah simpler, austere               
               • Charter of duties for both groom               and bride 
               • Meher at nikah time,               but can be paid later in jewellery 
               • Shariat law only way to address marital               discord

 








On why women should not be given the right to divorce, Maulana said the proposition was not acceptable as financial liability, in case of separation, fell on the man. The nikahnamah is split into five sections: details pertaining to bride and groom, list of witnesses, Meher (bridal price), guidelines and acceptance of contract.

The most significant section is the set of guidelines for couples. Spelling out the duties of both bride and groom, Maulana Nizamuddin quoted the guidelines as stating: ‘‘The two have to respect each other’s emotions.’’

The guidelines also prohibit dowry. ‘‘The groom’s side cannot even demand food arrangement for guests accompanying them,’’ the Maulana said.

On meher, the nikahnamah suggests that it should ideally be handed over at the time of nikah, but can be given at a later stage too.

 ‘‘But if some part of the meher is given after the nikah, it should be in terms of jewellery,’’ Maulana Nizamuddin said."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)
With the Centre and the Supreme Court locked in a tussle over the new Memorandum of Procedure for the appointment of judges, P P Choudhary’s position as MoS Law assumes significance. A first-time MP from Pali in Rajasthan and a senior Supreme Court lawyer, Choudhary was part of the Joint Committee of Parliament that looked into the contentious land acquisition Bill brought in by the NDA and which was later abandoned.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: Tell us about your journey from being a senior lawyer to becoming a Union minister in the NDA government.
I have been in the legal profession for the past 38 years. I am a first-timer in politics. I was inspired by the call of Narendra Modi ji to provide clean and transparent governance for the betterment of the country. It was then that I decided to take a plunge into politics. I got a ticket to contest from Pali in Rajasthan and I won by over four lakh votes. As an MP, I participated in over 350 debates in Parliament, sought the response of the government through 394 questions and submitted 22 private member Bills for consideration. If I had to sum up my politics in one line, then I would say that I felt suffocated by what I saw at the lower level. It is painful, and that was one reason why I decided to enter politics. Now, when I see my colleagues in Parliament, I feel good.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
MANEESH CHHIBBER: People think the judiciary and the government are in confrontation. Is that a correct perception?
I think this perception is absolutely incorrect. Our government can never think of weakening the judiciary. The common man of the country reposes immense faith in the justice delivery system to redress his grievances. Hence the credibility and independence of the judiciary are of paramount importance. Our duty is towards strengthening the independence and credibility of the judiciary, and the NDA government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has been making extensive efforts in this direction. But, sometimes, remarks are made. I believe that one constitutional functionary should not be accusatory towards another, be it the government, the judiciary or Parliament. While the executive speaks through its orders and actions, legislature speaks through the enactment of laws, the judiciary speaks through its judgments. Hence, it is these judgments which should be given due weightage.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: Is there a communication gap between the government and the judiciary?
I don’t think such a communication gap exists. However, I feel that there is always scope for improvement. One of the ways forward could be to hold periodic meetings between the government and judiciary at the highest levels.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: But then why are so many appointments stuck?
I have a list (of appointments) till November 15, 2016. Till date, four judges have been appointed to the Supreme Court, 124 additional judges have been made permanent and 120 fresh appointments of judges have been made in various high courts. We have not received names for the seven vacancies in the Supreme Court. The sanctioned strength of the judges of high court has also been increased from 906 in June 2014 to 1,079 judges as on November 25, 2016. This data speaks for itself. I don’t need to draw a conclusion. Right from Independence till date, so many appointments have never been made in 8-10 months. And if you still say appointments have not happened, it will be contrary to the data I have provided.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: So why does the government want more power over appointments in higher judiciary?
It’s not a case of government seeking more power in the appointments of higher judiciary. Were appointments made before the collegium system better or worse? I can name several judges who passed judgments that are still recalled and followed. The Constitution prescribes a collaborative process in the appointments, where both the executive and judiciary have been entrusted with clearly demarcated roles and responsibilities. The government has always given significant weightage to the judiciary’s recommendations.
With regard to the collegium system and the existing Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), the Supreme Court has, in its December 16, 2015, judgment, acknowledged the need ‘to introduce transparency in the matter of appointment of judges to the higher judiciary’. This is not our verdict or opinion. It is felt that the present collegium system is not equipped with an efficient mechanism to objectively evaluate the competence of candidates in a holistic manner. Hence, I feel that both the executive and judiciary must work in a coordinated manner through an extensive process of consultation for appointment of judges.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: Now that the government has sent the revised draft of the MoP to the SC, where is it stuck and why is it not getting finalised?
Acting as per the directions of the Supreme Court on December 16, 2015, the government initiated the process of drafting the revised MoP. After passing through several rounds of consultations with the SC, the latest draft MoP, which is in consonance with the court’s judgment of December 16, 2015, was sent on August 3, 2016, for the consideration of the Supreme Court collegium. It may take more time and deliberations must be on for sure. Both (the judiciary and the executive) have the same aim, though the means might be different. Both the government and the Supreme Court collegium want more objective considerations and fewer subjective considerations in the procedure (of appointments). Personally I feel that apart from finalising the revised MoP, the original spirit of the Constitution needs to be restored in the appointments of the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts by defining the word ‘consultation’ under Article 366. In my personal opinion, there should not be any insistence on making any further appointments as per the old MoP. This shall be against the true spirit of the December 16, 2015, judgment of the Supreme Court.
SHEELA BHATT: But won’t judges know better than the government about judges and the quality of judgments?
The appointment of judges has been made a collaborative and consultative process between the judiciary and the executive, so that both can pool their resources together to select the best candidate for the job. I do agree that the judicial competence of a judge or a practising lawyer can be best gauged by the judiciary. But the collegium system is flawed and the SC itself said so; this is not the government’s observation. The appointments are not without flaws. Appointment of a judge to higher judiciary requires a holistic assessment of the qualities of the candidate which go much beyond judicial competence. Here, it needs to be noted that one of the reasons for the increase in vacancies in the higher judiciary, despite recommendations by high courts, is that the collegium rejects, on an average, 30 per cent of recommendations made by the high court collegium. On matters of national security, the government holds the wherewithal to evaluate any threat, and any input or opinion given with respect to national security by the government needs to be given due weightage.
UNNI RAJEN SHANKER: You said that if the government raises issues of national security, it should be put on record and the SC should not be asking questions. How is that transparent? Two, the names of 43 judges have been rejected by the government. How was it linked to national security?
First of all, no person can claim the right of appointment. The SC can only insist that you should appoint such and such person. But because this is a constitutional post, this involves national security. As I said earlier, apart from judicial competence, the government is well-equipped to assist the judiciary in a holistic evaluation of the candidates. Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution signify the role of the executive in the appointment of judges. If the government finds that an appointment goes against national security or overrides public interest, then such an appointment can be declined by the government and reasons for the same can be shared with the Chief Justice of India. Thus, there is complete transparency in the process.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Centre’s stand on triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code has led to an uproar. Are you playing vote-bank politics?
As far as the issue of Uniform Civil Code is concerned, it is enshrined in Article 44 of the Constitution as one of the Directive Principles. The matter is currently being examined by the Law Commission and once it submits its report, the government will examine it. As far as the issue of triple talaq is concerned, it needs to be remembered that personal laws must be examined in the light of the overarching goals of gender justice and dignity of women. The underlying idea behind the preservation of personal laws was the preservation of plurality and diversity among the people of India. The need for preservation of such diverse identities cannot be a pretext for denying women the status and gender equality they are entitled to under the Constitution. Even Muslim countries, where Islam is the State religion, have undergone reform in this area of the law. In a secular republic like India, there is no reason to deny women their rights.
VANDITA MISHRA: You said you are a first-time MP who became a minister too. That’s unusual in politics, especially if you don’t have political clout or backing. How difficult was it for you to join politics?
I would not say that this is unusual. There are several people in Parliament who are first-time MPs and who have become ministers. Our prime minister is also a first-time MP. The NDA is against dynasty politics and every person is accorded a role in the organisation and government based on governance requirements. Getting a ticket to contest elections wasn’t difficult. After that, I held 600 meetings in 17 days.
VANDITA MISHRA: You said you felt suffocated by what you saw at the lower level of politics. What is it that you found most suffocating?
The suffocation I spoke about earlier was with reference to corruption in the country. When I entered politics and saw that elections involve a lot of money and that there is a lot of corruption at the lower levels, I was disappointed. In Modiji’s government, there is no corruption, there are no allegations against the government or its ministers. This is in complete contrast to what used to happen in the past, when 2G and several other scams were reported. There has been status quo in the bottom rung for the last 60 years, so yes, it will take time, but we will clean up the system. The root cause of corruption is the existence of a parallel economy which generates black money in the country. Through the unprecedented move of demonetisation, the Prime Minister has initiated the process of weeding out the malice of corruption. Demonetisation has shaken certain people who operate with money and muscle power. Modiji has the support of the aam aadmi in this campaign. Now if a political party asks its cadre to destabilise things, it’s another issue altogether. But for the genuine people — the salaried ones, who always pay their taxes — it is a welcome step.
NANDAGOPAL RAJAN: The use of social media is expanding but there are no laws to govern it. Do you think we need laws to govern the medium?
If your question is related to cyber security, as Minister of State for Electronics & IT, I can assure you that this issue is of immense significance for us. As a medium, Internet is a truly democratic global platform which provides individuals with an opportunity to express themselves and also serves to bridge the digital divide. However, this freedom should not cause harm or undermine the rights of other individuals. Within the fold of the ministry, institutions such as CERT-in are taking proactive measures to ensure that the public as well as private data is well protected. As far as the issue of prevalence of laws governing social media is concerned, there is no law governing the behaviour of individuals in cyber space. However, whenever the behaviour of an individual in cyber space affects the rights of other individuals, the Information Technology Act prescribes the nature of the crimes as well as the quantum of punishments attached to such crimes, to safeguard such rights.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: After the recent ICANN conference, where it was decided that the US government is set to cede control of the cyberspace’s underlying technology, you had said that may be some of these servers and master servers could be in India too.
On October 1, 2016, the US had transferred its stewardship role in ICANN’s IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) to a multi-stakeholder community . Ten of the root servers in the world are located in the US, while the other three are located in Sweden, the Netherlands and Japan. India is a country known for its strengths in the field of providing quality IT and ITeS services to the world. Our software professionals are working all over the world, with a majority in the US and Europe. Thus there is a case for a new root server to be located in India. Besides this, we have also taken the matter of Indian representation in the ICANN board, as India has around 450 million active Internet users at present. Half of the next billion Internet users would be from India. This would provide India a role in the international Internet governance, and democratise such international governance institutions further. They have to take a decision.
SHYAMLAL YADAV: There is a perception that this government is against RTI. What does your experience say? Is RTI a problem for the administration or is it a solution and a tool for good governance?
The RTI Act was enacted by Parliament and not by a court order. The government made it a law. It felt that the government should be transparent and its procedures, except confidential documents, should be known to the common man. The government is not at all uncomfortable with it. The government can never be uncomfortable with a law enacted by Parliament.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: You filed a number of PILs while you practised in courts. In the past few years, it has been said that PILs are being misused. Do you think it’s time to regulate PILs?
There can be no hard and fast rule. It differs from case to case. I think the courts will have to decide which PIL to entertain and which not to look at. If the PIL brings to the court’s notice a violation of fundamental rights, or if it is about poor people who cannot approach the court by themselves, then I think courts should entertain them. But if the court feels that a particular PIL is politically motivated, frivolous, filed to build someone’s political image or has an ulterior or oblique motive, then the court should disallow it. While I am not in favour of a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure for regulating PILs in the country, I believe that there is a need for creating robust checks and balances, including initiating penal actions against any kind of PILs which are politically motivated."

The contentious issue of triple talaq was the main point of deliberation on Saturday, the first day of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s (AIMPLB) two-day meeting, at the Lucknow campus of Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama. The meeting comes three days after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that his government was going to present its view on the triple talaq in Supreme Court after consulting women affected by the practice.
The evening meeting was chaired by AIMPLB president Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadvi and attended by vice-president Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq and general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani among others. Board member Kamal Faruqui said several matters — including triple talaq and Babri Masjid — are slated for discussion by the executive committee of the Board and the outcome will be announced on Sunday.

The AIMPLB has been opposing changes to the Muslim personal law by the court or government. At its three-day convention in Kolkata in November, it had passed a resolution in support of triple talaq. At the same time, it announced the formation of a dedicated women’s wing of the Board to look into problems faced by Muslim women. While most political parties have advocated non-interference in Muslim personal law, BJP declared its support for Muslim women who want the practice to be abolished.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the formation of BJP government, a few Muslim women had come up with the demand that the Yogi Adityanath government should act on its poll promise. A group of these women had met the state’s Women and Child Welfare Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi a few days ago. On Tuesday, Adityanath had said that the state government will present its “stand formed on the basis of Muslim women’s opinion” to the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions related to triple talaq.
Earlier in the day, the Shia community had appealed to the AIMPLB to “keep in mind the Quran, Shariyat and humanity before arriving at any decision”."

(For representation)
In 1983, I filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging Muslim Personal Law as being discriminatory to Muslim women. I was divorced by the utterance of triple talaq and thrown out at midnight by my ex-husband. Life was difficult. I worked as an office assistant on a salary of Rs 600 per month and lived as a paying guest. My husband found me out and threatened me. I said, “You have divorced me. I can live and work wherever I want to.’’ He said, “You are my wife. I will file a case for restitution of conjugal rights.’’ It was his word against mine. I consulted five qazis, each of whom gave me a different version of my divorce.
I did not know what my legal marital status was. Was I married or divorced? That was when I decided to hire a lawyer and challenge this form of divorce and Muslim Personal Law in the SC on grounds of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. This was the first case of its kind in the Court. My petition provoked harsh criticism not only from the conservatives in the community but also from those I had expected to support me — the liberal sections. Some were disgusted at the way internal affairs of the community were being made public. Others felt I lacked the knowledge of Islam necessary to challenge its laws. Yet others felt that I was just frustrated in my personal life.
The Mumbai-based feminist organisation, Forum Against Oppression of Women, and Indira Jaising’s Lawyers’ Collective came to my rescue and decided to fight my case free of cost. The forum and others who supported me were not Muslims. Muslim intellectuals felt that the change should come from within the community. Muslim men associated Muslim Personal Law with their religious identity and did not want it to be changed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
I began to think of organising Muslim women. It wasn’t as easy as I had thought. Most progressive Muslims, I realised, didn’t want to take a stand against the ulema publicly, though they believed in my cause in private. Shabana Azmi, Kamila Tayabji, Asia Siddique and Anis Sayyed supported me publicly.
I studied Islamic law, wrote articles and gave talks on it. I completed my graduation and started studying law, joining Lawyers’ Collective as an intern. We started handling Muslim women’s cases. I kept in touch with these women and helped in rehabilitating them. Sometime in 1987, we called all these women to the house of Anwari, whose case we were handling, and showed them Jaddo-jehad (struggle), a documentary in which I and other Muslim divorcees had been interviewed. This documentary helped the women to open up and we started discussing issues such as triple talaq. When I asked them, “Shall we meet again?’’, the answer was a unanimous “Yes”. So we continued to meet at Anwari’s place. We decided to call ourselves Aawaz-e-Niswaan (voice of women).
Aawaz-e- Niswaan had to contend with unusual teething problems: Intimidation by goondas in the Muslim areas of Dongri and Nagpada, and the perception the area’s women had of me — that I was an outcast. However, in time, I integrated with the local population so successfully that women began to turn to me for help and men actually discussed issues across the table.
All this seems like it happened yesterday but it’s actually been 33 years. The big difference is that we were a handful then and today it is heartening to see so many Muslim women approaching the SC and amazing that so many Muslim men — ordinary citizens, artists, and intellectuals — support them. However, since the issue of triple talaq has been deliberately mixed up with the Uniform Civil Code, I must state that I reject a Uniform Civil Code, as it is being used as a stick to beat the Muslim community. Does anyone have a blueprint of this so-called code? We need a code that is based on the principles of equality and justice.
As for my learned brothers of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, I would like to tell them: Most Islamic countries have abolished triple talaq and modified the Sharia to suit the present. They should agree that the same be done in India."

(Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)
India has been built by saints, yogis and fakirs, not by any king or emperor, Yoga guru Ramdev said on Wednesday. “Yoga has been an inalienable part of our culture. No king or emperor has built India or shaped its destiny. In fact, India has been built by saints, yogis and fakirs. It is a matter of pride for us that the Prime Minister is a yogi, and the Chief Minister of the most populous state is also a yogi,” he said. The Yoga guru was addressing the first day of the three-day UP Yoga Mahotsava here.

“Ram Rajya would definitely come to Uttar Pradesh,” he said. Underlining the benefits of Yoga, Ramdev said, “We will do Yoga together and take steps to remove societal illness, diseases, bad habits, intoxication and other negativities. This will make lives peaceful and prosperous.”
On the issue of triple talaq, he said, “There should not be any injustice with any woman, irrespective of the religion they belong to. Secondly, those who have faith in judiciary would not endorse triple-talaq. And, if anyone is citing the Holy Quran to substantiate their logic, they are simply insulting Islam and Quran.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Yoga Guru also exuded confidence that Uttar Pradesh will become “an ideal state where spiritual and economic development would co-exist”.
“Economic development alone may eventually lead to path of destruction. UP–the land of Rama, Krishna and Shiv–is moving towards positivity,” he said.
“The government of the day is of saints and yogis, and today we are witnessing the blend of Yog Dharma and Raj Dharma. In a span of nearly a week, the state government has made history. UP has become free from tension, deceit and intoxication,” Ramdev claimed.
The Yoga guru also met Governor Ram Naik at the Raj Bhavan later in the day."

(Source: File/Representational image)
The Allahabad High Court’s observation calling triple talaq “unconstitutional” has elicited a variety of responses from the community. Some have supported the observation, hoping that it would create a mood against the practice. “It is the right thing to do. As far as politics goes, every time this comes up or change is attempted, they will say there is something political. The UP elections will be over in the first quarter, but Muslim women have lived with this inconsistency for many years,’’ said Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan functionary Zakiya Nomani, who has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against triple talaq. “We think all women want this arbitrariness to go, and at least 70 per cent of men. Ahle Hadees and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind have also been forced to speak against it.”

Milli Gazette editor Zafrul Islam called the observation inevitable. “If the community will not redress its own wrongs, then disgruntled people will approach courts, and seek relief and get it. When Muslims the world over have rejected this, then why not Indian Muslims?” Many see triple talaq as a red rag waved to typecast Muslims and shame them as backward, rather than enforce genuine gender parity. Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind’s Mahmood Madani hinted at politics influencing the picking of such issues. “It is a fashion to speak of talaq and triple talaq now for courts. We at our recent gathering have spoken of the ills of random and arbitrary ways of divorcing partners, and we think it is un-Islamic, but for the courts to deliberately drag in this issue, it appears there is a desire to signal something else and keep this matter relevant.’’
All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Uzma Naheed asked whether only Muslims and their personal laws are to be commented upon. “I do not think it is fair to just speak of aspects of Muslim Personal Law and make exceptions of them. We do not think that triple talaq is ideal and we are looking for ways to fight this within the community. But courts saying things like this is principally wrong.’’
Majlis-e-Mushawarat president Navaid Hamid was critical of the way the HC has handled the matter and called this as an erosion of Muslim rights. “Why is the Padmanabhaswamy Temple judgement the way it is? In India, there is the recognition of a sphere of personal and religious law. Those lines must be respected. What about the widows of Vrindavan, why is that not made an issue?” MP Asaduddin Owaisi called the observation unnecessary as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court."

(PTI photo)
The Congress on Saturday accused the Prime Minister and the BJP of politicising the triple talaq issue and even suggested that the saffron party was trying to drive a wedge between Muslim women and their husbands to create a new vote bank. Senior Congress spokesperson Ghulam Nabi Azad said no other political party except the BJP and its ideological mentor the RSS are trying to politicise the issue.
The Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha said no Muslim believes in triple talaq and the practice is adhered to as per the holy book in which certain norms and time-frame have been laid.
“When the society is already discussing this issue of triple talaq and the court is looking into it, then why is the BJP unnecessarily coming in between Muslim women and their Muslim husbands. The BJP should not make attempts at creating a new vote bank,” he told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement today urging Muslims not to view the issue of triple talaq from political perspective, he alleged that it was the Prime Minister who was politicising the issue.
“He is the biggest champion of politicising the issue. He is the champion and he started it. And to say not to politicise it, is itself politicising it,” he said, adding that the Prime Minister should exercise restraint and rein in his partymen.
Azad asked if any other political party was seen raising the issue except BJP and RSS.
He said if any other leader was saying so, it was only in response to what the BJP is saying.
“BJP leaders and the RSS have been making this a political agenda before and during the elections. This is the agenda of the BJP and the RSS to politicise it. Other parties have only responded,” he said.
Azad said he does not think any Muslim believes in misusing triple talaq as “it is against Shariyat, Quran and Islam”.
“BJP is politicising triple talaq. It is illegal, as it does not stand in religion or in the Quran. Talaq is a long drawn process and time frame has been given and Muslims go by it,” he said.
He said no Muslim believes in triple talaq in one go and added that for thousands of years, ills and infirmities in various religions have existed and are corrected with time. He also cited the social evil of Sati among Hindu women which have been eradicated over time.
“People have made many interpretations and there have been several changes. Whatever is good remains and others are removed,” he said.
Modi today urged Muslims not to view the triple talaq issue from a political perspective and expressed the confidence that efforts to end the practice would be led by “enlightened” members of the community.
At a function to mark the Basava Jayanti celebrations in honour of Kannada philosopher Basaveswara, Modi referred to the 12th century reformer’s movement against regressive practices to speak about triple talaq."

PTI
Syed Alauddin Alimi has declared himself as Sajjadanashin (hereditary spiritual head) of 13th century Sufi Saint Moinuddin Chishti’s shrine in Ajmer. He said he assumed the responsibility after removing his elder brother, Syed Zainul Abedeen Ali Khan, 75, from the post for his comments calling triple talaq un-Islamic and asking Muslims to stop eating beef for communal harmony.
Alimi, 65, “ousted” Khan after declaring him a non-Muslim over his comments. He claimed to have consulted clerics after reading Khan’s statement in newspapers on Tuesday. “I talked to the chief mufti (Islamic jurist) who said Abedeen has become murtad… he is no longer a Hanafi Muslim. I called an urgent meeting of family and everyone agreed that he is not fit for the post since he is no longer a Muslim,” Alimi told The Indian Express. “So after the Qul (conclusion) ceremony on Tuesday, I sat on the ancient holy seat, the Khanaqah, and declared that Abedeen was no longer the Sajjadanashin and that from now on I will hold the post.”
Alimi has sought written opinions or fatwas from major clerics across the country to back his case even as Khan said he stood by his remarks. Khan, who had asked the government to declare cow a national animal, said Alimi’s move was “without legal basis” and a “conspiracy by Islamic fundamentalists”. He rubbished his ouster and declared his son, Naseeruddin Chishti, 40, as his successor.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The hereditary staff of the Sajjadanashin supported Khan. “He is still the Sajjadanashin and the post becomes vacant only after his death. The post is hereditary and only the son or the nearest male heir of the last Dewan can hold the post after his death, according to the Supreme Court order of 1987,” Muzaffar Bharti, a staff member said.
The court had ruled that the “hereditary office of Sajjadanashin is entitled to be claimed by descendants of the Saint by the rule of primogeniture”. It had said that hereditary post would pass on to the son or the nearest male heir to the last Dewan. Bharti blamed fundamentalists, who are miffed with Khan’s secular ideas, for provoking Alimi. “Nobody is willing to recognise this little stunt by Alimi. Zainul Abedeen Khan is still Dewan. He even performed several rituals sitting on the Khanaqah after the Qul ceremony.’’"

As the debate surrounding Triple Talaq and uniform civil code intensifies, a woman from Dattotar in Madhya Pradesh has reportedly written a letter in blood to the Chief Justice of India describing how she and her daughter have been harassed for dowry and how her husband abandoned her after triple talaq.
Shabana, Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar reported, said she does not want to be a burden on her parents and does not wish to live life like this. She wrote that a life like this is like a thousand deaths and appealed for permission to end her and her daughter’s life.

According to the photo of the letter posted by Hindi news website, Patrika, Shabana wrote she was married to Shah as per Muslim rituals on May 25, 2011 and has a four-year-old daughter, Tahzeeb with him. Shah divorced her giving triple talaq and informed her that he has “no interest in her”. Shah married another woman on November 19, 2016.
In her letter written in Hindi, she also added that she vehemently opposes the Muslim personal law, for which the future of her and the child have been ruined. She added that she has faith in Indian judiciary and hoped that many women like her would get proper justice.

Defending the validity of triple talaq before the Supreme Court, the AIMPLB had earlier said that a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her if the practice is discontinued.
The board also said that divorce proceedings instead of triple talaq could damage a woman’s chances of re-marriage if the husband indicts her of loose character in the court.
The AIMPLB also asked the Supreme Court to keep its hands off the issue, saying that principles of marriage, talaq and polygamy are interwoven with religious and cultural rights of Muslims, which cannot be touched upon by any court on the ground of violation of fundamental rights.
The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men’s lust, but it is a social need."

It asked the the lawyers to file small synopsis of cases pertaining to alleged victims of triple talaq and also submit issues to be thrashed out in accordance with the legal provisions and the Constitution.
The Centre had earlier opposed the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Ministry of Law and Justice referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, however, had rubbished the stand taken by the government that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental rights like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution."

“It (triple talaq) is an innovation which may have served a purpose at a particular point of time in history but, if it is rooted out such a move would not be contrary to any basic tenets of Islam or the Quran or any ruling of the Prophet Muhammad,” said Justice B D Ahmed.
Justifying his suggestion on rooting out triple talaq system, Justice Ahmed said the “harsh abruptness” of triple talaq has brought about extreme misery to women and even the men who are left with no chance to undo the wrong or any scope to bring about a reconciliation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The court’s observations on triple talaq were made while disagreeing with a woman’s plea that her husband’s physical relationship with her after pronouncing triple talaq, in her absence, amounted to rape.
Quashing rape charge against, Masroor Ahmed, the court said, “First of all, it (talaq) was given in extreme anger, secondly it was never communicated to the complainant (wife).
Therefore the rape is not made out,” the Court said.
Masroor’s wife, Aisha, alleged that her husband had physical relation with her without disclosing the fact that he had pronounced talaq, when she was away to her parental home.
The court held that since the couples divorce was invalid, the husband’s physical relationship with his legally wedded wife, subsequent to his pronouncement of a talaq, would not amount to rape."

In a first, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Sunday decided to form a women’s wing to look into burning issues such as talaq, even as it passed a resolution in favour of triple talaq. The resolution passed at the AIMPLB’s three-day convention, which concluded on Sunday, stated that the government was infringing into the personal laws of Muslims.

The women’s wing would also deal with other issues like family disputes and education, AIMPLB secretary Zafaryab Jellani told a press conference here after the convention.
It decided to launch an all-India Muslim women helpline, a toll free call centre in Urdu, English and eight regional languages to counsel and guide Muslim women on family disputes to go to the Darul-Qaza.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It has been decided for the first time that we will form a women’s wing to go into issues concerning Muslim women and an all-India Muslim women helpline, a toll-free call centre in Urdu English and 8 regional language,” Kamal Farooqi, a member of AIMPLB said.
“It seems that the government is bringing up this isssue of Triple Talaq and Uniform Civil Code ahead of UP polls in order to communally polarise people and reap political dividends,” he said.
The AIMPLB said it wanted to be the part of a discussion with the government, though the government did not bother to hear their views.
“It is the opinion of the AIMPLB that the Shariah laws have their origin in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah. These Shariah laws are divine laws and cannot be modified changed or altered by any person or authority,” Farooqi said.
The point of view of AIMPLB has been explained in detail through the affidavit filed before the honourable Supreme Court, he said.
“The moment we came to know that the Central government is going to file an affidavit in the Supreme Court, we approached the Prime Minister and five cabinet ministers through a registered post to get the point of view of the board, which represents all schools of thought in the country, heard.
Unfortunately, the predetermined mind of the government did not think it fit to know the AIMPLB’s point of view,” he added. Farooqi alleged that the questionnaire prepared by the Law Commission fell short of professionalism.
“The questionnaire prepared by the Law Commission not only falls short of professionalism regarding such a sensitive issue, but smacks of the intention of the present-day government to meddle with professional laws and bringing in the uniform civil code through the back door,” he said.
He, however, hoped that that good sense would prevail in the government and it would withdraw its affidavit filed in the apex court. The board has now prepared its own questionnaire and circulated it among Muslims for signatures in support of triple talaq.
“Lakhs of Muslim women have supported AIMPLB on its stand on triple talaq and the issue is a tool used by the government to interfere in AIMPLB’s affairs. The government is trying to project Muslim women as suppressed and oppressed, which is wrong,” Asma Zahra, executive member of AIMPLB, said."

The introduction of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has been talked about for decades, indeed since Independence. It was part of the BJP’s 2014 manifesto, and the attempt at reform of triple talaq has sent alarm bells ringing among liberal intellectuals and conservative Muslims. The uniform liberal view seems to be that the UCC is an imposition by a right wing Muslim-unfriendly government and that reform of triple talaq is just a way to beat up or subjugate the Muslim community. The “liberals” (I will have the word in quotes until it is established that the “liberals” are actually liberals) claim that there are discriminatory anti-women laws among the majority Hindu community, and that these need to be reformed first, before imposing majority views on the minorities.
WATCH VIDEO: PM Narendra Modi Bats For Equal Rights : Here What He Said On Triple Talaq

 
Let us start with first principles. In a fair, just and ideal world, rights should be human rights, unaffected by sex, or religion. The Indian Constitution came close to defining it in this manner. Article 44 of the Constitution, “Uniform civil code for the citizens” states: “The state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”. Unfortunately, the Constitution writers inserted this clause in the non-binding Directive Principles of State Policy section.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Constituent Assembly debates make up for the lack of appropriate specification in the Constitution. Particularly relevant for today’s debate are the comments of K.M. Munshi, made 68 years earlier. His summary view on the UCC, which he supported, was “This attitude of mind perpetuated under the British rule, that personal law is part of religion, has been fostered by the British and by British courts. We must, therefore, outgrow it.”
At the time Munshi made his comments, Hindu law was very anti-women. However, post 2005 and passage of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005, men and women have equal rights to inheritance, property etc. Besides some possible capital gains benefits for those filing under HUF (Hindu Undivided Family), there are no differences (that I can surmise though I am willing to be corrected) in the rights of Hindu men and Hindu women.
However, this was not the case in 1948 when Munshi said: “I know there are many among Hindus who do not like a uniform civil code, because they take the same view as the honourable Muslim members who spoke last. They feel that the personal law of inheritance, succession etc is really a part of their religion. If that were so, you can never give, for instance, equality to women. But you have already passed a Fundamental Right to that effect and you have an article here which lays down that there should be no discrimination against sex. Look at Hindu Law; you get any amount of discrimination against women; and if that is part of Hindu religion or Hindu religious practice, you cannot pass a single law which would elevate the position of Hindu women to that of men. Therefore, there is no reason why there should not be a civil code throughout the territory of India.” (emphasis added). Not surprisingly, Munshi, a Congressman and governor of Uttar Pradesh during 1952-55, resigned from the Congress and became the vice-president of the newly formed Swatantra Party. He recognised early on that the Nehru-led Congress was no party for liberals.
The Muslim community has attacked the suggestion of a UCC as a direct attack on itself. A recent press release, signed by 103 “Muslims and people of Muslim descent” states at the outset that it is “against the instant arbitrary triple talaq as practiced in India and we support the demand of the Muslim women to abolish it.” However, the statement goes on to add that “The present regime and their earlier avatars have used the Uniform Civil Code as a stick to frighten and demonise the Muslim community and polarise opinion. Uniform Civil Code has been always been projected by such regimes and right wing politics as a Hindu vs Muslim tool. The fact of the matter is that many of the personal laws irrespective of which religion they belong to are archaic and anti-women… We appeal to all liberal, progressive sections of the Muslims as well as all other citizens to support the struggle of the Muslim women for reform and to expose the nefarious designs of both the present regime as well as of the patriarchal conservative Muslims who are colliding with the retrogressive forces to take the attention away from the most important issues and the failures of the present government on all fronts.” (emphasis added)
It is intriguing that the “liberals” have moved from attacking triple talaq and women’s rights to an all-out attack on a “right-wing” government. Let me see if I understand this right. The previous Congress governments went all out for appeasement (remember Shah Bano?) of Muslims to get a few extra votes and irrespective of the fact that they were being blatantly anti-women; the present government, even if it is against triple talaq and pro-women rights is suspect because it has failed on all fronts?

Even “liberals” like Flavia Agnes (interview to Firstpost.com, October 19) have problems with implementing the UCC at this time. In a not too dissimilar statement than the one above, she states “today the faith of Muslim communities in the present right-wing government is at very low ebb. Hence the political climate is not conducive to reforming laws of minorities or for bringing in a Uniform Civil Code”. (emphasis added)
When asked about why the UCC should not be implemented, she counters by obfuscation. “When discriminatory practices within Hindu law and cultural practices are discussed they are not framed as ‘Hindu’ but are discussed in general terms as ‘women’s problems.’’’ One such Hindu problem coming in the way of the UCC is “the problem of dowry-related violence and dowry deaths. There is no research conducted as to how many women who are murdered for dowry are Hindus. A research done by our organisation about cases which have reached the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court revealed that more than 90 per cent were Hindus. Less than 10 per cent were Muslims and others.”
Assume for a moment that all 100 per cent of dowry deaths are Hindu. What does that fact have anything to do with the desirability of a UCC? These deaths are illegal; are not sanctioned by law, Hindu or otherwise. If not implemented, it is a law and order problem, not a UCC problem. It is somewhat disappointing to note that whereas a fundamentalist Muslim country like Pakistan has banned triple talaq our “liberals” are arguing that UCC should not be introduced until India has solved all problems related to women — nay, all problems related to womenkind. Masha Allah, “liberals”.
Implementation of the UCC will not result in zero dowry deaths, or make zero the practice of bigamy among Hindus, or the practice of “quadrigamy” among Muslims. Further, the UCC will not end violence against women. To ask for a solution to all women-related problems before introducing the UCC is to blatantly argue against the interests of women. Which is why the quotation marks on “liberals” remains."

Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday advocated the abolition of ‘triple talaq’, saying it was a form of gender discrimination and against constitutional principles. “Gender discrimination must come to an end. We are a civilised society, we are a democratic country; why should there be gender discrimination? Triple talaq is a gender discrimination and against the principles of Constitution,” the Union Information and Broadcasting Minister told the media in New Delhi.
Watch what else is in the news

“Why should those helpless women be penalised for somebody else’s fault. That is why the BJP, the government, is strongly in favour of ending the practice of triple talaq,” said Naidu.
“Triple talaq is not a communal issue or a religious issue, it is an issue of gender justice. It is an issue of ending gender discrimination; it is an issue of equality before law, which is granted by the article 14 and 15 of the Constitution. I said it earlier and I am repeating it again for sake of those people who are not able to understand it. Unnecessary dragging the Prime Minister and Sangh makes no sense,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His comments came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first comments on the controversial issue, said the government and society should ensure justice to Muslim women and not let their lives be destroyed by triple talaq. Naidu avoided a direct comment on the rift within Uttar Pradesh’s ruling Samajwadi Party but said “dynasty politics was nasty for democracy”.
“Dynasty in democracy is nasty but it is tasty to some people and we are seeing the results also,” he said, adding the BJP doesn’t want to “fish in their troubled waters.”
“It is their internal matter, but people are seeing what is happening and they will decide what should be done,” added Naidu."

The Rashtriya Adivasi Ekta Parishad, a group that claims to work to protect Adivasi interests, has moved the Supreme Court seeking protection of their customs and religious practices, including their right to practice polygamy and polyandry.
The group, which claimed to be representing interests of 11 crore tribals, has stated that any direction to impose the Uniform Civil Code would adversely affect their distinct customs, culture and heritage.
WATCH VIDEO: PM Narendra Modi Bats For Equal Rights : Here What He Said On Triple Talaqhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The NGO claimed the Adivasis (tribals) had their own personal laws and do not come in the category of Hindus as they worshiped nature instead of idols and performed burial of the dead. The marriage ceremonies of tribals are also different from the Hindu rituals, it submitted.
“In case of Uniform Civil Code, the Advasi’s right to perform marriage, worship, last rites and other ceremonies would be abrogated,” said the NGO, seeking to be heard along with others in a batch of cases that have questioned the validity of triple talaq and polygamy in Muslim community.
It highlighted that polygamy is practiced among the Naga tribes, the Gonds, the Baiga, the Lushai among others, while polyandry is prevalent in the Himalayan region stretching from Kashmir to Assam. In its classical form, it is found among the Tiyan, the Toda, the Rota, the Khasa and the Ladhaki Bota, it pointed out.

Likewise, the group said the dissolution of marriage and divorce are easily possible among the tribals on various grounds by a simple ceremony.
The tribals can marry more than one woman and the bar imposed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 does not apply on them, it said. The Delhi-based group, which claimed to be working for the betterment of tribals for over 25 years, also submitted that as per Article 44 of the Constitution, Uniform Civil Code is to be secured by the state and not court.
The group also cited various constitutional provisions giving protection to the ST from various parts of the country."

Sayyd still insists on using her husband’s surname, until she can end the marriage officially in an Indian court. But like many other women from India’s large Sunni Muslim minority, her fate and status are governed by Muslim Personal Law that follows the tenets of the Islamic faith, as interpreted by local imams and religious schools across India.

Watch Video: What’s making news 

The so-called triple talaq, or instant divorce, has been banned in more than 20 Muslim countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh. But in India, the practice is allowed thanks to the country’s rules protecting Muslim, Christian and Hindu communities following religious law.
Most of the 170 million Muslims in India are Sunnis governed by Muslim Personal Law for family matters and disputes. Those laws include allowing men to divorce their wives by simply uttering the word “talaq,” or divorce in Urdu, three times — and not necessarily consecutively, but at any time, and by any medium including telephone, text message or social media post.
Some women are fed up with what they say is an archaic and patriarchal rule that too often leaves them destitute. Muslim women do not have the same right, and those left by their husbands have no claim to alimony though they can collect a small payment for three months after divorce.
Then, they’re on their own.
“They have been divorced by speed post, by sending out letters. Some have just simply said “talaq” three times and the divorce has happened,” Noorjehan Safia Niaz, co-founder of Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, or the Indian Muslim Women’s Movement.
The movement has been fighting for equal laws for Muslim women for six years.
“There are cases where women don’t even know that they’ve been divorced,” Niaz said. “The children are without any support. So, it has become very convenient for Muslim men to just say talaq thrice and . it is just so easy for him to get the woman out of his life.”
Legal experts say the practice is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court has been pushing for uniformity in laws. In 1985, the top court ruled ordered a man to pay alimony to his elderly wife, after verbally divorcing and abandoning her.
The Indian government in office at the time, however, managed to overturn the verdict retroactively by passing a law to protect Muslim divorce law. Many suspect the government was under pressure from Muslim leaders to stay out of their business or lose their electoral support.
The move frustrated women’s rights activists. India had long since banned dowry payments from a girl’s parents to the family of a groom before marriage, though many still practice the ancient Hindu tradition openly, they note. And more recently, India threw out Hindu laws that barred women from inheriting property from their fathers.
What makes the instant divorce laws so difficult, some say, is the fact that they are not codified and so are open to interpretation and adjustment.
One Supreme Court lawyer called the practice “barbaric.”
“This is a kind of an ISIS-like rule prevailing in India,” the advocate, Monika Arora, said, referring to the militant Islamic State that controls much of Syria and Iraq. “No progressive country can tolerate this.”
Earlier this month, the women’s movement collected more than 50,000 signatures, calling for a nationwide ban on instant divorces. That petition was being added as evidence in an appeal filed to the Supreme Court to ban instant divorces. The court has asked the central government for its opinion before scheduling a hearing.
Since the 1950s, “Hindu personal law has been constantly evolving and codified,” Arora said. “Why this ‘touch-me-not’ perception for Muslim laws?”
She said India should follow the example set by other Islamic nations, including Turkey, Cyprus, Pakistan and Bangladesh, in banning the triple talaq.
But there is sure to be resistance. Some Islamic bodies, including the hardline Raza Academy based in Mumbai, say any women who dislike the laws of Islam can always leave the religion.
One academy cleric, Mohammad Saeed Noori, said it was possible that men were not performing the triple talaq correctly.
“Don’t give three altogether in one go. People who do that are doing it wrong,” Noori said. But “if he says it thrice, then the divorce is immediately confirmed. Then that woman has to immediately leave his house.”"

BJP chief Amit Shah Friday said “anti-India” comments won’t be tolerated under the guise of freedom of expression. “The idea behind democracy is to ensure that the last person avails the benefit of freedom of expression and is able to fully utilise it to develop himself, but prolonged dissent will divide the nation,” he said. Shah was speaking at the India Idea Conclave here. The theme for the three-day meet is Democracy, Development and Dissent.
Shah said since Independence, PM Narendra Modi has been the most bitterly criticised figure. “Though Narendra Modi is the PM, you can criticise him, his policy and his ministers. But if you speak against the country, forgive me, that won’t be tolerated as it is not in the real spirit of the freedom of expression,” he said.
The BJP president said that it was after 30 years that the nation had voted a party to power with an absolute majority. “The government is working with an idea of inclusiveness and development in every sphere. However, if dissent continues unwarrantedly, there can be no development,” he said.
He also said that the centre is in no confusion on empowerment of women, irrespective of religion. “On triple talaq, the government is clear. The Prime Minister spoke of it on the Independence Day,” Shah said."

Citing Haji Ali Dargah Trust’s ‘progressive’ decision to grant women full access to the shrine’s sanctum sanctorum, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday urged Muslim leaders to display their rational capacities on the issue of ‘triple talaq’ as well. It said that its time that the Uniform Civil Code is viewed from a “positive perspective” rather than adopting a rudimentary approach over the issue.
“The change of stand by the (Haji Ali) Trust may have opened doors of the Dargah for Muslim women, but they have a difficult path ahead. Countless Muslim women are waiting to be freed from the shackles of age-old customs in the name of religion,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
Generations of women have been deprived of the right to live a dignified life, and are plagued with the menace of triple talaq and are forced to concede to ‘fatwas’ from religious leaders, it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Muslim women are scrunched under the burden of old thoughts with men still wanting to hold the reins. The Haji Ali Trust’s stand is a welcome step. Now, Muslim leaders need to show similar rationality on issues like triple talaq as well,” the Sena said.
“Rather than seeing the Uniform Civil Code as cruelty towards Muslims, it should be seen from a positive perspective. With this, not only Muslim women, but the entire community will automatically get included in the mainstream,” it said.
Yesterday, the Haji Ali Dargah Trust told the Supreme court that women will be given access to the core area of the Muslim shrine here at par with men, and sought four weeks to make the requisite infrastructural changes to facilitate their entry."
"1617717009-30","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","Woman, invisible","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/woman-invisible/","Woman, invisible","July 26, 2004","Moments that hold the potential for social change often remain unnoticed because national obsessions lie elsewhere. Yet, today, there are significant reasons why it is possible to address the seemingly intractable issue of delivering justice to Muslim women in ways that appeared impossible even a few months ago.
For one, the BJP has lost power at the Centre. It’s ironic to state this, because the party had projected itself as the greatest guardian of the “welfare” of Muslim women, as its loud championing of the uniform civil code would indicate. But the BJP’s concern extends only to the extent that the issue is a convenient stick to beat the community with and expose the Congress for its hypocritical policies of “minority appeasement”. This is not to say that the Congress hasn’t been despicably double-faced when it came to addressing this concern. Its years in power saw Muslim women increasingly relegated to the four walls of home, the notorious chardiwari of feudal norms and individual disempowerment.
The return of the Congress to the Centre does, however, have one positive fallout. Muslims have less reason to worry about their identity or rights being  threatened; less cause to be defensive about their public stances. This makes the community more amenable to the idea of reform. Already there are indications of this. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board may not have outlawed triple talaq after its sitting earlier this month, but it has promoted the notion of a reformed “nikahnamah” (marriage contract), recognised officially that triple talaq is a “social ill” which Muslim society has to address, and, significantly, has ruled that denying women the right to inherit agricultural property was not sanctioned by the Shariat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is true that Muslim women in India are way behind their counterparts in Pakistan and Bangladesh in terms of personal law. In ’55, the All Pakistan Women’s Association (APWA), reacting to the marriage of then prime minister, Mohammed Ali, to his Middle-eastern social secretary while being still married to his first wife, began to lobby for  the promulgation of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance in ’61, which raised the legal age of marriage to 16 for girls, placed restrictions on polygamy, ensured the registration of marriages, acknowledged the wife’s right to divorce and adequate maintenance. Above all, it rejected triple talaq and set a more transparent procedure in place.
Such reform would perhaps never have come Pakistan’s way if it had not been under martial rule at that point — Ayub Khan pushed it through ignoring protests — and the fact that an elite body of women like the APWA had direct access to those in power. In India, by contrast, Muslim women constitute one of the most invisible communities in terms of education, rights, employment and decision-making. Unequal Citizens, A Study of Muslim Women in India, by Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon, based on the findings of the first comprehensive baseline survey of Muslim women in India, reveals that across the country Muslim women are more illiterate than Hindu women: 59 per cent of them have never attended school, less than 10 per cent have completed it. To compound matters, 26 per cent of educated Muslim women have illiterate husbands and less than 15 per cent said they  were working.
But damning as this evidence is, there has been over the last decade or so a groundswell of expectations among Muslim women and an increasingly focused articulation in favour of reform. The voices of ordinary women that were raised at the public hearings that Syeda Saiyidain Hameed, as a member of the National Commission of Women (NCW), conducted all over India in ’02, were a vivid reflection of this. Collectively, these voices signified one important phenomenon: that the patent lack of individual rights of Muslim women was a consequence of their poor status. It would seem, then, that the singleminded focus on personal law that has marked the public debate is an insufficient, even skewed, approach. If they are empowered as individuals, with access to education and employment, they would themselves be better equipped to fight for their rights and promote reform .
Hasan and Menon recognise that this “disproportionate emphasis” on the gender bias of personal law has led to the neglect of the secular discourse of development.. They argue that to understand Muslim women better, it is important to locate them within the broader context of economic, political and other interests and recognise their “disadvantage, discrimination and disempowerment are experienced at specific and particular intersections of class, caste, gender and community”.
It is interesting to revisit history to discover how Muslim women were left marooned on an island of indifference and discrimination. In many ways, they suffered the most from Partition, being twice-damned as a minority within a minority. In post-Independence India, Muslims as a whole felt their identity threatened and women, as the manifest symbol of that identity, paid a high price for this by being deprived of even the weak currents of reform that may have come their way. Today, the mean age of marriage for Muslim women is 15.6 years, while the all-India figure is around 20. Yet not many  know that among the first demands of the All India Muslim Ladies Conference was education for Muslim women and the raising of the minimum age of marriage to 16.
These demands were put forward in 1914. As historian Gail Minault explains in her essay, ‘Sisterhood or Separatism: The All-India Muslim Ladies Conference’, the members of the Conference were clearly of the view that early marriage was detrimental to the education of girls. That a demand articulated in 1914 is, tragically, still relevant in 21st century India highlights the immeasurable injustice that Muslim women have suffered.
Today they want to step out the dark, they want education and employment. They want to be seen, not just as members of a community but as individuals with rights. Professor Zameeruddin, speaking at an NCW hearing, expressed the enormity of the task graphically: “To solve the problems narrated by these women today is not in human hands. Perhaps the angels have to descend from heaven.”"

The shocked woman, a BDS student and hailing from Chertala in Alappuzha district, has now approached the Kerala Women’s Commission for help.
The young woman in her complaint said her husband had not even informed her if he had reached Ber Dubai, where he is working, safely. After her repeated messages to him went unanswered, she finally got a reply shocking her to the core.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Why are you calling me? I do not like you. Do not wait for me. If we like apple, will we keep eating it every day?. We will like to eat other fruits also. Talak Talak Talak”, the woman, who was at her wit’s end seeing the message, told the Commission, its member J Prameela Devi said.
She wants her husband to be tracked and Non-Residents Affairs department has been asked to trace him, Prameela Devi told PTI.
Prameela Devi said she spoke to Panakkad Sadik Ali Thangal, an Islamic scholar, who was of the opinion that this type of talaq was against rules.
The woman’s widowed mother had given her Rs 10 lakh as dowry and 79 sovereigns of gold. After 10 days of marriage, he left for Ber Dubai and did not keep in touch with her, she said.
The Commission has sent a notice to the parents of the man asking them to appear before it in the next sitting.
In the aftermath of the shocking development, both the woman and her younger sister, studying in 12th standard, have left their studies.
Describing talaq through social media like Facebook and WhatsApp as ‘barbaric’, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen state President T P Abdulla Majeed, said this was against humanity.
“There is no validity of such an act. Some people are playing with religion”, he said.
“Talaq cannot be practised in such a flimsy manner. It has got three stages. It has to be used only in a situation wherein it is extremely difficult to take forward a marriage”, he said.
Reacting to the development, Dakshina Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama leader Kadakkal Abdul Azeez Moulavi said there was no validity of such talaq."

Dargah Deewan Zainul Abedin Ali Khan said  on Monday that Muslims should take initiative to stay away from slaughter of bovine animals and not consume beef so that a good and positive message could be communicated in the country.
He announced that he and his family members will not eat beef now onwards and said that the government should declare cow as the national animal.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Releasing his message in the presence of religious heads of various shrines from different parts of the country during 805th annual Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti in Ajmer, Khan also said that saying ‘triple talaq’ at one time for seeking divorce is not as per the Shariah law and Muslims should refrain from disobeying the Sharia law.
“The government should widely impose ban on slaughtering of all bovine animals and sale of beef, which is one of the prominent reasons for communal hatred. Muslims should become an example by taking resolution to not consume beef in the interest of communal harmony in the country,” he said.
Welcoming the Gujarat government’s move to enact a law with the provision of life sentence for those found guilty of cow slaughter, the Deewan said that the central government should declare cow as the national animal if the government wants to protect it.
“Cow is the symbol of religious belief. Not only the government, but it is also the duty of every follower of the religion to protect them,” he said.
On the practice of ‘triple talaq’, he said that it is not only irrelevant today but against the sentiments of the Quran.
He said that while practising justified divorce, the side of the woman should be considered equally and detailed dialogue with her should also take place.
The Deewan said that there are several provisions in the Quran to ensure self-respect and dignity to women in the society.
He said that saying ‘talaq’ three times in one sitting is not a religiously valid practice and there should be a period of time between repeating ‘talaq’ thrice for divorce.
The religious heads of various sufi shrines from various parts of the country including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar among others were present on the occasion."

The first few months went off blissfully, after which, Afreen alleged, her husband and in-laws began troubling her for dowry. It began with mental harassment, before Syed Asghar began physically assaulting her, Afreen, an MBA, alleged.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Last September, after her in-laws drove her out of their house, she returned to Jaipur to stay with her mother. Afreen said she last saw her husband at her mother’s funeral in Jodhpur.
Suddenly, on January 27, this year, Afreen said she received the talaqnaama (divorce letter). “It came through a speed post…I was shocked,” she said.
A few days later, she, along with her two brothers, went to her husband’s house in Indore but found it locked. Learning that the family had moved to their ancestral village — Shajapur near Indore — Afreen decided to file an FIR. Her husband was subsequently detained.

However, when he refused to accept her back, despite counselling sessions and police pressure, Afreen said she decided to challenge the system. “The Muslim Personal Law Board needs to move with the times.

Claiming that Uniform Civil Code issue is another “trump-card” of the BJP, the Communist Party of India Tuesday alleged that the lead party of NDA government may try to keep it alive till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with an aim to reap political dividends.
CPI General Secretary S Sudhakar Reddy sees the current debate on the code as a “diversionary tactic” adopted by the BJP-led NDA government.

He expressed the view that the code is a “diverse and complex issue” and not an “urgent issue at the moment” as “there are so many other problems”.
Reddy, however, said there is a necessity to take a relook at the triple talaq issue.
“Some reform should come (in Muslim Personal Law) but it is necessary to convince the minority community (on the need for it)”, he told PTI.
“This (debate on the code and triple talaq, among others) is being brought as a diversionary tactic. There is necessity to discuss the whole in the Muslim community itself about such demand for reforms,” he said.
“It’s not something urgent to divide the nation on that issue and I don’t think the government is serious in bringing the code. The debate before the Uttar Pradesh elections (due early next year) is aimed to get political dividends,” Reddy alleged.
Asked if he expected the code issue to “die down” after Uttar Pradesh elections, he said, “They may continue till 2019 also. This (the code) is another trump card like Ayodhya, so called nationalism, patriotism to cover up pro-corporate, anti-labour, anti-people policies of Government of India. They may keep it as an important point of debate.”"

Vice President Hamid Ansari’s wife Salma Ansari has said that uttering ‘talaq’ thrice does not amount to divorce and asked Muslim women to read the Quran thoroughly instead of relying on clerics. Salma Ansari’s views on triple talaq come at a time when there is a nationwide debate on the practice and the validity of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy practices among Muslims challenged in the Supreme Court.
“Triple talaq is not an issue. There can be no ‘talaq’ (divorce) just because someone utters talaq, talaq, talaq,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a function here yesterday.
Salma said women can find an answer to their questions in the Quran itself.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If you’ve read the Quran then you can find the solution there itself. There is no such rule in Quran. They have just made it up. There is no such thing. You read the Quran in Arabic and don’t read the translation. You accept whatever the Maulana (clerics) or the Mulla says. You must read the Quran, read Hadis. Just see what Rasool had said,” she said in reply to a question on the practice of triple talaq.
Women must have the courage to read the Quran by themselves and introspect what’s written in it and gain knowledge about it, she said, emphasising that women should not blindly follow anyone.
Women can be easily misguided if they don’t read the Quran, she said.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had recently told the Supreme Court that the pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.
The Board had also said that the validity of Mohammedan Law, founded essentially on the Holy Quran and sources based on it, cannot be tested on the particular provisions of the Constitution.
The Centre had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
The apex court had taken suo motu cognizance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in the event of divorce or due to other marriages of their husband."

Days after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court that the sanctity of Muslim personal laws cannot be altered, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the women welfare department to oversee an exercise of collecting opinion of Muslim women on the triple talaq practice so that these could be presented before the top court.
The government plans to complete the exercise within weeks because the case is to be heard by a Constitution Bench in May.
In its manifesto for the assembly polls, the BJP had promised to take up the triple talaq matter. After the party’s stunning win in the elections, BJP leaders claimed that Muslim women had backed the party because they were opposed to the practice.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On Tuesday evening, government departments, including those linked to women welfare, made presentations before Adityanath. Sources said the Chief Minister told them that his government will present to the court the views of Muslim women on the triple talaq.
Adityanath, sources said, directed that a mechanism be worked out soonest for the exercise. He asked women ministers to hold meetings with women’s outfits in this regard — there are five women in the state cabinet.
Women Welfare Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi said women ministers will get together and meet department officials and NGOs to find out the quickest means of collecting “correct information” about women divorced under the triple talaq practice and seek the opinion of Muslim women.
Maintaining that it will not be a government exercise, Joshi said NGOs will be engaged to reach out to Muslim women. She said several women had met her with grievances related to triple talaq.
When his comments were sought on the move to collect opinion on triple talaq, AIMPLB executive member Zafaryab Jilani said more than 90 per cent Muslim women do not want changes in Muslim personal laws.
Jilani said if the state government wants to collect opinion of Muslim women on triple talaq, it should hold a referendum on the issue and the Board should be provided names and addresses of women so that it could verify if opinion had been sought from genuine people.
On March 27, the Board told the Supreme Court that talaq and polygamy are integral part of the religion of Sunni Muslims and the court could not alter the sanctity of personal laws. Executive members of the Board are to meet in Lucknow on April 15."

As Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls, a contest between three strong political forces — two parties and an alliance — is shaping up. On the eve of the polls, the SP has emerged as a strong contender, capable of challenging the BJP, thanks to a three-move political masterstroke by the incumbent chief minister.
First, through the crisis, Akhilesh Yadav presented himself as a dedicated chief minister, who was the victim of the machinations of a cabal of schemers from the party, led by his uncle. Respecting social conventions, he refrained from criticising his father publicly and let his uncle be seen as the villain of the piece. Second, the Election Commission granted Akhilesh Yadav the party symbol, vesting him with authority and legitimacy to seize control of the party. Third, he disposed off most of his uncle’s and father’s remaining loyalists by allocating a large number of tickets to the Congress. This alliance has turned the election into a three-corner fight, in which the SP stands to gain the most.
Large pre-poll alliances are not new in UP. The SP and the BSP fought together in 1993 and the Congress with the BSP in 1996. The SP-BSP tie-up was an alliance between equals while the latter alliance was to the advantage of the BSP, which contested 296 seats. This is the second time that the Congress is reduced to playing the role of a supporting actor, this time for the SP, even though it obtained more tickets than it could have hoped for, a few weeks ago. This is a role for the Congress in UP that remains quite unnatural for it, which it has adopted by default and with little enthusiasm.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Akhilesh Yadav is now facing the electorate unopposed within his own family; he can concentrate on the goodwill he has built over the past five years, with the bonus that whatever his government has delivered is credited to him personally, and whatever his government has botched up, or failed to deliver, is laid at the door of his uncle and his father, who have both sunk into irrelevance.
Should he win, Akhilesh Yadav would be the first chief minister to serve two consecutive terms in Uttar Pradesh since G.B. Pant in 1952, who won the state’s first election as the incumbent chief minister of the erstwhile United Provinces.
The BSP, in contrast, seems to be trailing, although its opponents as well as commentators often underestimate its strength. Mayawati’s popularity among Jatavs is intact, in part due to the lack of credible alternatives for Dalit voters. The party will be rewarded for fielding a large number of Muslim candidates, even though the Muslim vote is always split between parties.
Muslim voters, in recent years, have been voting strategically in favour of candidates most likely to represent them and win against the BJP. The coordination between voters is local and benefits parties, according to local circumstances. This is why the Muslim vote appears scattered once the data is aggregated, even though it is cohesive on the ground. The BSP, however, seems to have lost its ability to attract votes from other groups, particularly because it has to fight two strong, credible opponents — that was not the case in 2007.
The BJP, in this campaign, has repeated some of the mistakes that cost it the election in Bihar. It has picked insignificant allies, purely on the basis of caste calculations. It still refuses to promote its state leadership, for the fear of seeing an alternative figure to the prime minister emerge from the Hindi belt. Lastly, it started its campaign on the prime minister’s development-for-all agenda but has produced a manifesto replete with issues that are irrelevant to the electorate it seeks to win over — the Ram temple, triple talaq and the anti-Romeo squads, a clumsy rehash of the failed “love jihad” campaign. Nonetheless, the BJP remains popular among its upper-caste base and the groups that are not descriptively represented by other parties, essentially the non-dominant OBCs. The youth electorate, which voted massively for Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, is likely to split its vote, part of which could possibly go to Akhilesh.
Regardless of their outcome, these elections have already confirmed four trends that have recently emerged in state politics. The first is that state elections have turned into a plebiscite for or against individuals, rather than parties or governments — call it the presidentialisation of state politics, in which the local strength of candidates or the party identity matters less than the appeal of the party leader.
The second trend is that in a competition that is still structured around caste and notably around caste-based distribution of tickets, voters are increasingly strategic in their political choices. Recent studies of electoral behaviour reveal that voters are less and less determined by their ascriptive identity as far as voting is concerned. Young voters, in particular, can change their vote between elections very easily. There are very few pockets of captive voters for any party anymore.
Third, this second development owes partly to the fact that most parties seek to mobilise voters across traditional lines of division, such as caste or religion. Voters reward parties with cross-sectional appeal, which deliver without discriminating on the basis of identity. As a result, the personality of the leader becomes the main element of differentiation among parties. In recent years, the core support base of the BSP — Jatavs — and the SP — Yadavs and Muslims — has eroded. But this has been more than compensated by their ability to attract votes across groups.

Fourth, in order to develop a cross- sectional appeal, regional parties have changed their discourse and are focused on general interest issues, such as development and social justice. In a context of rising inequalities and frustrated economic aspirations, development trumps identity.
This means that the BJP is increasingly challenged by regional parties on its own terrain — development and personality cult. The distinction in this regard between the BJP and regional parties in power is not as sharp as it is between the BJP and the Congress. The fact that states are better equipped than the Centre to provide tangible development to voters also plays in favour of regional parties.
What we understand as “backward politics” has changed substantially over the past decade, and the analytical tools used to study or cover them — identity, patronage and a consensus on their general governmental incompetence — need to be reviewed and adapted to the present times."

AMID A raging debate on triple talaq, RSS on Friday said it was opposed to any injustice on the basis of gender. For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Centre’s stand has created ripples with Opposition parties claiming that the issue is being raised before the Uttar Pradesh elections to polarise the electorate on religious lines.

Talking to mediapersons in Lucknow, Prabhu Narayan, RSS’s Awadh Prant sanghchalak, said that though the issue of triple talaq has been raised by Muslim women who have moved court, RSS believes that “no one should face injustice because of his gender”. “We believe everyone must get respect and equality,” he added.
Prabhu Narayan, along with sah prant karyavah Narendra were speaking to mediapersons about the Sangh’s Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal meeting in Hyderabad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To a question on building Ram temple in Ayodhya, Narayan said Sangh had never led the Ram temple campaign nor will it do so in future. “Sangh supported the demand of sants and people on the issue. We still support their demand and want the temple to be constructed. But we don’t raise any demands. It is to be done by sants,” he added.
Narayan further said that the RSS has been working to remove social evils like untouchability and social discrimination. “Balasaheb Deoras (former RSS sarsanghchalak) had said that if untouchability is not a crime, then nothing else can be a crime. We are working for the integration of the society. We are also telling people that untouchability is a crime and the use of religious texts to justify discrimination is wrong,” he added.Lucknow NewsClose aide of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari held in ambulance case‘Abducted’ Aligarh girl found living on rent in BulandshahrCovid resurgence: With nearly 4,000 cases a day, patient count climbs to 22,820Click here for more
Narendra said RSS will soon start a campaign to resolve any disputes over sharing of water, cremation grounds or sites of worship. “Sangh workers will focus on resolving disputes on sharing of wells or temples. We will try to make sure that everyone gets to use these places and there is no discrimination,” he added."

(Representational)
The Chairman of Minorities Commission for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Abid Rasool Khan, has urged All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Jamaat-e-Ulema to rethink their stand on triple talaq because the issue has the “potential to escalate” and cause the “derecognition” of Muslim Personal Law and imposition of a uniform civil code.
In a letter to the two organisations, Khan said: “Whatever be the history, today this has become an issue which has the potential to escalate and cause the eventual derecognition of our Personal law and the imposition of uniform civil code.The ulema are the only people who have the power to change this and who are responsible for using that power for the benefit of the Muslims.’’

In his letter, Khan referred to eleven cases in which women ended up on roads after their husbands exercised triple talaq and denied them alimony.
He has also pointed out in his letter that though India is a secular country and recognises religious laws, such laws were struck down by courts where they were found to be in violation of human rights. “….If that happens, then the AIMPLB would have been instrumental in opening the door for the eventual imposition of the uniform civil code,” he said.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Khan said, “Triple talaq has grown into a huge social problem. When the marriage fails, the man simply walks away and marries afresh while the woman and her family suffers. This has to change. The Muslim Personal Law Board should do something to protect the rights of women.’’"

The Supreme Court said Wednesday it is open to examining whether the issue of triple talaq needs to be heard by a larger bench for an authoritative decision. A bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice A M Khanwilkar noted that it is “an important issue affecting a large number of people” and said the court would need to test the validity of triple talaq on the “touchstone of the constitutional framework” and previous verdicts on personal laws.

“We are straightaway not jumping to any conclusion. It has to be seen if there is a need for any further consideration of law by the constitution bench. If this issue has already been settled, we may not have to examine it any further but if there are other issues, we will have to decide if it would require a consideration by a larger bench,” said the bench, posting the matter for further hearing on September 6.
The hearing Wednesday saw a total of four petitions assailing the concept of divorce through triple talaq, with the bench allowing all of them to be impleaded. It also sought the stand of Centre on the issue within six weeks."
"1617717013-31","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","Women’s rights and wrongs","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/womens-rights-and-wrongs/","Women’s rights and wrongs","July 27, 2004","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board proclaims that triple talaq is a social evil, but it is equally assertive that this social evil should not be removed by legislative reform. There is no question of banning the practice. Maulana Sayed Rabey Al-Hasani Naqvi, the Board president, says: ‘‘Our laws are based on divine inspiration and triple talaq comes from the same inspiration, that is, Shariat. We have no powers to amend or abolish it. So the triple talaq is irrevocable.’’ It is difficult to understand how what is divine can at the same time be evil.
The Hindu religion has also been replete with many social evils that Hindu women had to face. The practice of sati which forceda Hindu woman to sit on the funeral pyre of her husband was abolished by the Sati Regulation Act, 1829, itself the result of a social reform movement launched by Raja Rammohun Roy. The reform was taken to its logical conclusion with the Widows Remarriage Act of 1856.
Among Hindus, polygamy too was rampant. Yet it was abolished first in Bombay State by the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriages Act, 1946. Later, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, put an end to polygamy throughout the country. Marriage among Hindus had been held to be sacrosanct, something that could not be dissolved — yet the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, provides for dissolution of marriage both by husband and wife on the grounds stated in the Hindu Marriage Act. The Indian Divorce Act has also been recently amended to do away with inequality between women and men in matters of divorce among Christians. Untouchability, yet another social evil, was outlawed by Article 17 of our Constitution.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Social and legal reforms must move together to ensure that all social evils are banished. It is often said that personal laws are outside the purview of challenge under Article 13 of the Constitution of India. But this has no constitutional or legal basis. The fact is that what is inhuman is both unconstitutional and illegal. A very interesting answer to the argument of the Muslim Personal Law Board lies in the fact that in several Muslim countries triple talaq has been banned or restricted. There are several countries where there is a uniform law of divorce, for all citizens irrespective of their religion. The power to legislate on marriage and divorce is specifically conferred in entry 5, List III, Schedule VII of our Constitution.
In legal awareness camps for Muslim women which I attend and help organise regularly, women of all ages, young and old, ask me one question again and again: How can a Muslim marry four times when Hindu, Christian or Parsi men can marry only once? How is that there is a right of triple talaq for men and no right of divorce for us? I ask them to raise their voice against triple talaq, for a model Nikahnama that will secure them their rights.
Discrimination against women regardless of their religion is a matter of grave concern. The days of patriarchy are at an end. Today women are taking their rightful place in all walks of life. After the Second World War, we made a transition to a world of human rights. The United Nations Charter proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal. Contrast this with the American constitution, which proclaimed that all men are born free and equal. The Beijing Declaration also proclaims women’s rights as human rights.
We cannot continue to dither on the enforcement of basic fundamental rights of women. The sooner the evil of polygamy and triple talaq in our country are banned and banished the better. The Women’s Reservation Bill has still to be passed. In the Hindi belt of our country, Hindu women have been deprived of the right of inheritance and partition in a joint Hindu family. A daughter just cannot be a coparcener like a son. This discrimination has been removed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Law Commission report recommending equal rights to daughters and sons in HUF property is gathering dust.
The community and the state must work together to ensure that our sisters enjoy full rights equal to men. The Constitution is supreme. Liberty and equality are the pillars of our Constitution. Let us make India a country of equal rights and dignity for women and men.

The Centre is likely to take “a major step” to ban triple talaq after the ongoing Assembly polls, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said and dared Samajwadi Party, Congress and BSP to make their stand clear on the contentious issue. Insisting that the issue is not related to religion but involves respect and dignity of women, he said the government “respects faith but worship and social evil cannot co-exist”.

He said the tradition of triple talaq denies respect for women and the central government is committed to end the “evil social practice”.
“The government may take a major step to ban triple talaq after the UP Assembly polls,” he said while addressing a press conference in Ghaziabad last evening. The Assembly polls being held in UP and four other states will conclude on March 11.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asserting that “every pernicious practice” cannot be part of a religion, the minister, who is a lawyer himself, said the Centre would raise the issue in the Supreme Court on three points — justice, equality and dignity of women.
“We are the only party which respects women. Neither do other parties offer a good place to women nor do they respect them,” said Prasad, a senior BJP leader. “The government respects faith but worship and social evil cannot co-exist,” he said.
Addressing a press conference in Lucknow today, the union minister said, “I want Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati to clarify their stand on the issue of triple talaq. Our (BJP’s) stand is very clear. The issue is not related to religion but involves respect and dignity of women.”
Attacking BSP, he said it should rise above caste politics and respect women. Referring to the SP-Congress coalition in Uttar Pradesh, he said, “This is an alliance of desperation between two dynastic parties… alliance of desperation between crime, criminals and corruption.”
Ridiculing the pre-poll tie-up, he claimed the “confluence of Ganga and Yamuna” will end up with one party merging with the other after the polls. “Which party will merge with which party will be seen after the polls. This is nothing but a theatre of the absurd,” the BJP leader said.
He also touched upon the salient features of BJP’s manifesto and the Union Budget and explained how it would help the poor. Yesterday, while speaking to mediapersons in Ghaziabad, Prasad had alleged that Samajwadi Party and Congress have entered an alliance as both parties “indulge in corruption, crime and loot”.
“Both parties are opportunist and have tied-up with each other just to stop the landslide victory of BJP,” he claimed.
Not a single big industry was established in Uttar Pradesh during the tenure of Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government, the BJP leader alleged, adding the funds sanctioned by the Centre for the development of the state has not just due to the feud within the Yadav family."

Rohith Vemula suicide
The suicide of Dalit PhD scholar Rohith Vemula, who had been expelled along with four others from the Hyderabad Central University hostel, snowballed into a political storm after the student committed suicide in a hostel room on January 17. The university had barred their access to public places on campus, although they were allowed to attend lectures and pursue their research. The students were punished for allegedly assaulting an ABVP student leader.

JNU sedition row https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The debate on nationalism made a reluctant comeback after JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar was slapped with sedition charge for taking part in a controversial event in the campus where anti-national slogans were allegedly raised. The controversy took an ugly turn when the student leader and journalists were heckled by lawyers inside the Patiala House Courts Complex. His arrest not only sparked a countrywide debate on nationalism but also a series of protests as the ruling dispensation and other right-wing organisations branded JNU president and students as “anti-national”.

Gujarat Dalit flogging 
In July, the flogging of seven members belonging to a Dalit family by gau rakshaks (cow vigilantes) in Gujarat triggered widespread protests in the state, with many activists attempting to commit suicide. The Dalit family was attacked by cow vigilantes for allegedly slaughtering a cow. An investigation by the Gujarat CID revealed that the cow was, in fact, killed by a lion. The Dalits were merely skinning the dead cow to sell its hide.

Kashmir crisis
Kashmir valley has been hit by unrest since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces in south Kashmir on July 8. The ongoing crisis is one of the worst periods of unrest that the Valley has witnessed in recent times. The government’s crackdown on militants and subsequent separatists’ sponsored agitation have crippled the normal life in the Valley with most of the shops, fuel stations and other business establishments being shut.

Dayashankar derogatory remarks on BSP chief Mayawati 
Uttar Pradesh BJP leader Dayashankar Singh was expelled from the party for his derogatory remark against Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati. Singh was criticised for drawing parallels between Mayawati and a sex worker while accusing the former chief minister of selling party tickets ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls. Singh’s comment caused a huge furore inside and outside Parliament, forcing the BJP to expel their party leader for six years. An FIR was filed against him by BSP following the incident.

Cauvery issue
The Supreme Court ruling over the sharing of the contentious Kaveri river reignited the tussle between neighbouring states Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  On September 5, the Supreme Court told Tamil Nadu to approach the Supervisory Committee set up to adjudicate disputes arising over the sharing of Cauvery water in times of distress — but it also passed an interim order to release 15,000 cusecs per day for 10 days (around 12 tmc ft in all) to Tamil Nadu, considering the plight of farmers there. However, the order triggered widespread protests especially in the Mandya and Mysore regions; farmers’ groups and pro-Karnataka oufits have called a statewide bandh with several cases of vandalism being reported.

Triple Talaq row
The issue erupted when the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) announced its decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court asking for a ban on triple talaq, and talaq given over email, SMS or by post to be declared invalid. Subsequently, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board decided to form a women’s wing to discuss the issues of talaq, among several others. AIMPLB passed a resolution in favour of triple talaq. The resolution passed at the AIMPLB’s three-day convention stated that the government was infringing into the personal laws of Muslims. However, the Allahabad High Court had earlier this month observed that the practice of triple talaq among Muslims is unconstitutional, adding that it violates the rights of women. The high court said no personal law board is above the Constitution.

Samajwadi Party internal rift 
An internal crisis broke out within the Samajwadi Party, threatening its prospects in the assembly polls early next year. Shivpal Yadav’s elevation as state party chief on September 13, replacing Akhilesh, had triggered the crisis within the party, with the Chief Minister retaliating by divesting his uncle of all portfolios that he held as a minister. The crisis deepened further when Shivpal quit the party post after Ram Gopal Yadav, party general secretary and cousin of Mulayam, described the decision to remove Akhilesh as a “mistake”. Though the party has scrambled to bridge the widening rift, insisting that there are “no differences within the family”, there seemed to be more trouble brewing for the family towards the end of the year.

BCCI vs Lodha Panel 
The ongoing tussle between BCCI and Justice Lodha made headlines throughout the year. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court observed that it is inclined to launch prosecution against BCCI president Anurag Thakur for committing perjury, adding that he will go to jail if held guilty of lying under oath in his attempts to obstruct reforms in the cricket body.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Saturday decided to oppose tooth and nail the Centre’s move against the triple talaq and the imposition of Unform Civil Code in the country. The decision was taken on the second day of the three-day closed door convention of AIMPLB, to discuss issues ranging from triple talaq, Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to other religious matters of the Muslims.
Watch what else is making news:


“It has been unanimously decided in the convention that we want triple talaq to stay and we will oppose any move by the government against it. We will also oppose uniform civil code. The triple talaq has been going on for ages and it is part of our religious rights,” TMC MP and chairman of AIMPLB reception committee Sultan Ahmed told PTI.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The AIMPLB has already launched a signature campaign opposing the move and more than 10 crore Muslim women from across the country have signed supporting the practice of triple talaq. The issue of alleged harassment of Muslim youths was also taken up during the convention.
“Our President Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadvi, during his speech, has clearly said that the BJP government at the Centre has taken up an agenda of unnecessarily harassing the Muslims of the country especially the young generation. The government has the tendency to implicate the Muslims as anti-nationals and harass them,” a member of the AIMPLB told PTI on condition of anonymity.
He said the BJP is trying to infringe upon the religious rights of Muslims and it will not be tolerated. “Muslims are part of this great secular, democratic republic India. We will fight against this communal designs of the BJP government”."

Balancing between imagination and conservativeness, he stuck to laying down a foundation for the promise of a disciplined era of coalition politics and economics, leaving the big vision to next year’s full Budget. But he surely put an exclamation mark on his Budget with a historic 1.1 percentage point cut in fiscal deficit. He plans to contain it to just 2.5 per cent of the GDP.
He also showed his pro-reform colours by raising FDI caps in telecom (from 49 to 74 per cent), civil aviation (from 40 to 49 per cent) and insurance (from 26 to 49 per cent). Chidambaram even managed to retain a modest disinvestment target of Rs 4,000 crore despite the obvious disapproval of the Left.


• Railway Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav managed to present a budget without increasing passenger fares or freight rates, announcing dozens of new trains, schemes, concessions, projects — all without a business plan on where the money will come from. The only positive — cheered by the markets — was that no hike in freight rates and no cut in passenger fares indicated that Laloo’s populism had been tempered by the Government.

A question mark hangs over the Centre’s Kashmir dialogue, with key Hurriyat interlocutor Maulvi Abbas Ansari stepping down as its chief last week, saying that the UPA Government is ‘‘insincere’’ in contrast to its predecessor, the NDA. Moreover, the Congress, is being accused by its partner, the PDP, of playing local politics, openly attacking Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed.


• The All India Muslim Personal Board made it clear last week that there was no question of a Muslim woman being given the right to divorce. Nor could there be any curb on the practice of triple talaq. The board executive committee decided to continue with the family laws adhered to so far while recognising the fact that triple talaq was a social ill which could not be corrected legally.

THE JAMAAT-e-Islami Hind, West Bengal, on Friday spoke in favour of Muslim personal laws and said the court should not interfere with the fundamental rights of the community. The outfit also opposed the idea of Uniform Civil Code and supported the stand taken by All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on triple talaq.
“Following the Sharia law is our fundamental right and we should be permitted to exercise those rights. We appeal to the court not to interfere with the Muslim personal law,” said the group’s state president Md Nooruddin.
Commenting on the idea of banning triple talaq, he said, “We think the option of talaq should be available to people. Sometimes separation is necessary if the relationship between couples is not working out. Separation is a social issue and it must be resolved socially. If the court interferes with such issues concerning the family then families would be ruined.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The outfit’s secretary Masihur Rahman said that they would launch a campaign from April 23 to May 7 across the country to raise awareness about Muslim personal laws.Kolkata NewsWest Bengal phase 3 voting today: Swapan, Ashima among 205 candidatesWon’t let any move to stop polls mid-way: Mamata BanerjeeCoal pilferage: Abhishek dares Centre to start investigation against all culpritsClick here for more

(Image source: Wikipedia)
Several political leaders, including those of Congress and the BJP, and social activists reacted to the Allahabad High Court’s observation on Thursday that triple talaq is unconstitutional and violates the rights of Muslim women. The court also said no personal law board is above the Constitution. Political parties, including the BJP and Congress, supported the high court’s observation, saying this would give more security and dignity to Muslim women.

Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury said this will secure the lives of the Muslim women and empower them with more rights to their life. “It’s an idea that has come of age; I am happy my Muslim sisters have more security to their lives, dignity to their lives. This should have happened long ago, I am happy that my Muslim sisters will have more rights in life.”
The BJP is also on the same page as Congress. BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi said, “There is no Sharia law in our country, if there was people’s head/hand would be cut off. The decision will benefit Muslim community. It is a progressive decision (triple talaq) by court, should be welcomed by all regardless of political affiliations.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another leader of BJP, R K Singh, said, “It is a progressive move by the court (on triple talaq). Only some orthodox people are objecting to it.”
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, “The Allahabad HC’s observation on triple talaq is important and should not end up like the Shah Bano case. It’s a very important decision and must be implemented.”
However, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) founder Kamal Faruqui didn’t support the high court’s observation. “Constitution gives me the right to follow my religion. It’s an observation by court, not decision. Islam is one of the most progressive religions when it comes to women’s rights. Talaq is part of Sharia law, no interference should be there.”
Muslim cleric Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali said: “Respect HC’s verdict but we’ve constitutional right to appeal agnst the verdict if not satisfied. AIMPLB’s legal committee will study the verdict and observation and then it’ll file its appeal against the said verdict. I don’t think it’s unconstitutional; if few people misuse law, you take action against them and not remove the law.”
Appreciating the court’s statement, social activist Zakiya Soman said, “I welcome the Allahabad HC’s observation, it”s true that triple talaq is not constitutional and must be abolished.”"

RAISING THE issue of triple talaq, BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday asked the women of Uttar Pradesh to make “safety of women” an issue in the state Assembly elections. Addressing a gathering in Sonbhadra district, in eastern UP, before flagging off the ‘Parivartan Yatra’, Shah urged the people to ask the “three parties” – SP, BSP and the Congress – to file an affidavit (in apex court) and make their stand clear: “triple talaq ke saath aap hain ya nahin hain (are you with or against triple talaq)?”
Watch what else is in the news

He pointed out that when the Supreme Court recently asked the Narendra Modi government whether the practice of triple talaq should continue, the government had replied that it was committed to ensure rights of women, and that they will get their rights. Claiming that other opposition parties – SP, BSP and Congress – are silent on the issue of triple talaq, Shah said, “Magar humey darr nehin hai (We are not scared).
“I want to use this occasion to urge Uttar Pradesh’s women to help make women’s safety an issue in these elections…. Alongside development of the state and uprooting gunda-gardi (hooliganism), respect for women should also be made an issue.” Shah earlier slammed Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on the Army’s surgical strike along the LoC in Kashmir and on the issue of One Rank-One Pension and said, “Rahul-ji, sena ke jawano ke maslon par rajneeti karna band karo (stop politicising Army issues).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In his address, Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha said that in 2012, the people of Uttar Pradesh had expected Akhilesh Yadav — “Videsh mein padha hua ek bhola-bhala aur masoom naujawan (a foreign-educated innocent young man)” who denied ticket to D P Yadav – will maintain the rule of law in the state.
But, Sinha said, irregularities were done in the name of recruitment and Akhilesh has deputed “numberdaar” (collection agent) in every police station and no FIR can be registered without their consent, address included. Minister of State (Finance) Santosh Gangwar and Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare) Anupriya Patel were also present at the rally, and addressed it."

(Representational image)
The rates of divorce of Muslim women is one of the highest among all religious communities in India, Census 2011 figures released last week show. The Census figures also suggest that among all married Muslim women, those between the ages of 20 and 34 were the most likely to be divorced — a proportion that is higher than in any other religious community in the same age group.
The vulnerability of Muslim women to arbitrary divorce — the infamous ‘triple talaq’ — has been part of the public discourse in India for long, entwined inextricably with the issues of the independence of Muslim personal law and the Uniform Civil Code favoured by Article 44 of the Constitution. On occasions such as the Shah Bano case of 1986, it has taken on powerful political overtones. Another victim of triple talaq, Shayara Bano of Uttarakhand, has now gone to the apex court in a quest for justice whose progress will be keenly watched in the coming months.
The Census data, which list the marital status of individuals from all religious communities, shows that the refined divorce rate — or the number of divorces per 1,000 marriages — for Muslim women was 5.63, well above the national average of 3.10.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Buddhist and Christian women had higher refined divorce rates of 6.73 and 5.67, while the number for Hindu women was only 2.60, lower than the national mean.
Nearly 44% of divorced Muslim women belong to the age group 20 to 34. This age group makes up only 24% of the total female Muslim population of India.
The Census has recorded about 13.2 lakh individuals as divorced in India — 9.09 lakh, or 68%, are women, while 4.5 lakh (32%) are men. The numbers are probably severely underreported, say activists. The refined divorce rate nationally stands at 2.3.
While Buddhist and Christian women reported higher divorce rates than Muslim women, what sets Muslim women apart is the stark disparity with men when it comes to divorce rates within the community. So, while Buddhist men have a divorce rate of 3.0 per 1,000 marriages and Christian men 2.92 per 1,000, Muslim men have a divorce rate of 1.6 per 1,000 marriages.
Which means that while divorce rates for men are lower than that for women in all communities, among Muslims, it is 3.5 times lower, as compared to 2.2 times for Buddhists and 1.9 times for Christians. Among Hindus, the rates are 1.47 per 1,000 for men, and 2.60 for per 1,000 for women.

The lower rates for men in all religious communities suggest that men in general tend to remarry at a far quicker rate than women — and do not stay divorced for very long.
Activists say the high rates of divorce, and the discrepancy in divorce rates in men and women among Muslims underscores the ease with which Muslim men can divorce their wives.
“Among Muslims, marriage is not a sacrament but a contract, and it is relatively easy to get a divorce compared to other communities. However, the desertion of women is also a major issue, and it is something that is lesser in the community,” activist Flavia Agnes said.
According to activists, issues like the “oral triple talaq” must be addressed soon. “It is a known fact that Muslim women remain the most vulnerable group when it comes to divorces in the country. For long we have been seeking that oral triple talaq needs to be abolished and Muslim personal law is codified to ensure justice for women,” Noorjehan Safia, convener of the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said."

Maulana Mohammad Wali Rahmani is the General Secretary of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). The board works for the applicability of Muslim Personal Law in India and is against a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). In an interview to The Indian Express, Rahmani tells Zeeshan Sheikh that if the code is forcibly implemented, Muslims would protest,
What is the AIMPLB’s stand on UCC?
We need to first see if UCC is required by our country or not. Our country is an amalgamation of different cultures and religions. If we try to bring in uniformity in religious matters, then the gains are few and the damage would be huge. The AIMPLB’s stand is that the system which worked for us, in which religions and cultures are allowed to flourish, should not be tampered. The UCC does not ensure equality, but disaffection in society. If you try to finish this multi-culturalism and homogenise everything, it will be harmful for the nation.
The directive principles laid down in the Constitution, however, talk about the state endeavouring to secure UCC across the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Such a thing is possible only when the hold of religion and culture on people breaks down and all religions get amalgamated. The Constitution does speak about the need to strive for UCC but Dr Ambedkar had said that only a mad government could think of implementing it. Based on Dr Ambedkar’s beliefs, I think that if the minds of the government and Supreme Court are not in the right place, only then should they tamper with personal law.
What the SC has stated on UCC is surprising because the case in which they made this statement was not related to minorities. It looks as if you are going down a particular street and decide to switch on the red light of the opposite street. At times even judges can make mistakes. To think that judges are learned is not the truth. They may be experts in law but their knowledge in these matters seems to be zero. They have claimed that marriage, divorce and inheritance are not related to religion. But they are related to religion where these things are decided by customs.
However, in the case of Muslims, these matters are directly related to the Quran which is the divine word. Those who are keen on UCC are failing to look at the complete picture of this country.
They do not understand the clout and hold of religion and culture on people. Just look at the outrage that has been generated over cow slaughter. There is no religious ordinance to stop cow slaughter. It is all cultural and this tradition is relatively new.
Even Gautam Buddha, when he attained Nirvana, is supposed to have slaughtered 70 calves. But today you speak about cow slaughter and see the outrage it generates. People are failing to look into how deeply we are affected by religion and traditions.
The UCC will affect all communities. However, there is a perception that Muslims are the main stumbling block for its implementation. Why is the AIMPLB so rigid about a uniform law?
We are ready to talk and hold discussions on this issue. The problem is that no one has approached us. AIMPLB has not uttered a word about UCC after the SC made a statement. However, we will protest if it is forcefully implemented. We are willing to talk and discuss on this issue. In a democracy, you need to converse. Moreover, the premise of our opposition to UCC is not so weak that we will be scared to negotiate on this subject. You also need to realise that it is not only Muslims who are opposed to such a move. Other communities including Sikhs have also spoken about the need for a separate personal law. The problem is that the media does not talk or write about them.
Islamic personal laws have been amended in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey and Bangladesh. Why can’t it happen in India?
Are we supposed to ape Pakistan and Bangladesh now. We will use our own mind. In Egypt, a small court decided to hang 800 people.
In Bangladesh, the courts are hounding Jamaat-e-Islami leaders. You think we should ape them? Indian Ulema is capable on matters of religion and we do not need to follow anyone.
Almost half the Muslim population, which is women, seems to be getting the wrong end of the stick when it comes to religious laws. Why are we not codifying personal laws to eliminate practices like triple talaq?
We have codified personal laws. However, if by codifying you mean making changes, then that is something we cannot do. All the women’s groups which speak about the need for codification have no experience of drafting legislations. AIMPLB has codified all personal laws, but if by codification you are seeking amendments, then that is not possible. We cannot change divine laws. Our laws are not based on tradition or culture, but on Quran and Hadees.
Are you supporting oral triple talaq? Many say this system has no religious sanction.
Those who say do so due to lack of knowledge. I do not feel there is a need to change any personal laws. There is a Section 302 in IPC. Has that brought down the number of murders? Changing laws does not help; you need to change the mindset of people.
Our Constitution also speaks about the need for prohibition. Morarji tried to do it and consumption of alcohol ended up increasing. The requirement is social change and not change in laws. I believe that triple talaq is the not the right way to go about. It is the most disliked thing that are permissible in Islam. However, we cannot close our eyes and say that it has no place in our religion. It does and we will have to live with it. If someone gives triple talaq, then it will be applicable.

The AIMPLB is not doing anything because it is not related to the purpose for which it was set up. However, at a personal level I would like to say that it needs to be condemned and tackled. A movement needs to rise to tackle this. But you also need to look at people who have been framed by the state in terror cases. You have people who have seen their lives being ruined. How will they get compensated? There needs to be a degree of fairness in the system. I say that the first person who started this trend of explosions was George Fernandes who planted gelatine sticks on railway tracks and places in Bihar where MLAs stayed.

IMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the triple talaq issue as the BJP wanted to “polarise” voters ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. “It is really surprising, but I am not surprised. But the Prime Minister, instead of making governance, corruption, the Yadav Pariwar’s infighting … the Prime Minister wants to make construction of Ram Mandir and triple talaq (as) the core issue(s) of the BJP’s campaign in Uttar Pradesh,” Owaisi told reporters.

Breaking his silence on the hugely contentious issue of triple talaq, Modi had yesterday denounced the practice among Muslims and deprecated attempts to politicise the issue while addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Hyderabad MP said Modi was talking about “polarising” issues, instead of focusing on constructive issues, to ensure that his party wins forthcoming polls.
“Talaq is the most disliked thing in Islam. People get separated. But, why is that Muslims are only made the target?” Owaisi said.
Why does not the NDA government take steps to give reservation to Muslims across the country if it is concerned about the welfare of Muslim women, he asked.
“Now the matter is in Supreme Court, it would have been in the fitness of things, had the Prime Minister not spoken about it. It shows BJP and the Prime Minister are short of constructive ideas, that’s why they are using the (issues) of Ram Mandir and Talaq to polarise voters for the forthcoming elections in UP, Goa and Punjab elections,” he said."

The Kerala High Court om Friday said equality before law has been denied to Muslim women in India in the matter of triple talaq. Disposing of three cases involving divorced Muslim women including change of name in spouse in passport for a person who had ended his marriage by triple talaq, the high court urged the need for codified law with regard to divorce.

In its 60-page judgement, the court said entire exercise is to alert the state that justice has become elusive to Muslim women and remedy lies in codification of law of divorce.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Delivering the judgement, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque observed that it is for the lawmakers to formulate the law relating to divorce through the process of legislation. The court asked the registry to forward the copy of judgement to the Law Ministry and Law Commission of India.
The state is committed to respect the promise of dignity before law and it cannot shirk its responsibility by remaining mute spectator of malady suffered by Muslim women in the name of religion, the court said.
The court also urged the need for a state legislation to regulate triple talaq.
The court added that the Quran nowhere approves triple talaq in one utterance and on the other hand promotes conciliation as best method to resolve marital discord.
Even Islamic countries like Egypt, Iraq and UAE have totally derecognised the concept of triple talaq. One has to wonder how equality before law has been denied to Muslim women in India, the court said.
State, as a measure, must strive to achieve meaningful action to sustain equilibrium towards national oneness in character of society while giving freedom to remain as one group, the court said.
The need for common civil code, though it is debated at different levels, still remains as mirage for want of agreement among different groups, it said.
It is possible to have a common code at least for marriage laws in India, the court said. The judgement concluded quoting verses from the Quran.
“It is for the state to consider formulation of codified law to govern the matter. Therefore, I conclude drawing attention of those who resist any form of reform of the divorce law of Muslim community in India to the following verses of Holy Quran (Chapter 47:2);
“And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammed- and it is the truth from their Lord-He riddeth them of their ill deeds and improveth their state”;
“Thus we display the revelations for people who have sense” (Chapter 30:28).”"

Amid the raging debate in the country over the ‘triple talaq’ issue, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu today said the practice should end as it is causing harm to women. The Urban Development Minister said the Law Commission and the Supreme Court had sought public opinion and discussion on the triple talaq practice.

“The Government of India, after discussion, has given its opinion that triple talaq is not in the interest of women. It should end,” said Naidu, who is also the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, said.
“That is the opinion of Government of India. And we have no inhibition on that. We are very clear that this practise is causing harm to the women,” Naidu told reporters here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His statement assumes significance in wake of several Muslim organisations and leaders, including Members of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, stressing that the “Sharia law cannot be changed”.
Suggesting the Central government to hold a referendum on the issue of triple talaq, All India Muslim Personal Law Board Zafaryab Jilani had recently claimed that 90 per cent Muslim women support the Sharia Law.
On October 7, the Centre had opposed in the Supreme Court the practise of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practises and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practise of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

The brothers, Abdul Sohail and Abdul Aqil, also put a display photo of tripe talaq on their mobile phones to convey the message to their wives, living in Moghalpura area. The police acted on the complaint lodged by the brothers’ wives who stated that after they received the talaq messages, the in-laws threw them out of the house five days ago and assaulted them when they resisted the eviction.  Police officials from Moghalpura Police station in South Zone arrested 60-year-old Mohammed Hafiz and wife Athiya Begum.

Police said that the two brothers Abdul Sohail and Abdul Aqeel had gone to New York last year after getting jobs in a private company. While Abdul Sohail had married Heena Fathima in 2012, Abdul Aqil had married Mehren Noor in 2015. Sohail and Fathima have two children while Aqil and Noor have one child. However, since last two months, the brothers have been sending messages to their wives regarding divorce which they ignored.
“Five days ago, my husband messaged ‘talaq’ written three times and another message that he had divorced me. This is unacceptable. My sister-in-law also received a similar message from her husband. Then both brothers put triple talaq as their status and display photo on Whatsapp. We have done nothing wrong to divorce us. If they want to divorce then it should be done legally and abiding the formalities. They cannot divorce us like this,’’ Heena Fathima said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The boys’ father, Mohammed Hafiz, said that as his sons divorced them, he could not keep them in his house anymore and kicked them out along with the children. The women staged a protest by sitting outside their husbands’ house.
When Deputy Commissioner of Police of South Zone, V Satyanarayana, intervened and asked the in-laws to allow the daughter-in-law in the house, Mohammed Hafiz flatly refused saying his sons had already divorced them. “He claimed that since his sons uttered talaq thrice over phone, under the Shariat law it was considered that they have already divorced so the daughter-in-law cannot stay in the house anymore,’’ Inspector R Devendra said.
When the two women refused to go away and sat on a dharna in front of the house, the in-laws allegedly assaulted and abused them following which they lodged a complaint."

Distancing herself from the Uniform Civil Code controversy, National Commission for Women (NCW) chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam has said that the NCW is only concerned with the banning of triple talaq and polygamy, which hang like “the sword of Damocles over the heads of Muslim women”.
“The debate has become increasingly polarised and political again, but our stand is not going to change. Triple talaq issue has nothing to do with UCC or any other code; it’s an effort to protect the rights of Muslim women… Whatever may have been said in the Quran many hundreds of years ago, we are not against that.

We are against the fact that triple talaq has deteriorated into what exists today, which is done unilaterally and leaves the woman and her children in bad shape,” said Kumaramangalam.
She added that the NCW is keen to ensure an end to this practice because a majority of women from the community are poorly educated and have no access to any recourse.
Stating that the demand for the ban has come from the community itself, she said, “They feel that the combination of triple talaq and polygamy is like the sword of Damocles over their heads.”"

It referred to constitutional principles like gender equality and secularism, and cited international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to emphasise that the practices need to be re-looked at by the court. Shayara Bano’s petition challenges these practices as being violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, particularly Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25, which are concerned with the right to equality, protection against discrimination on grounds of sex or religion, protection of life and personal liberty and freedom of religion respectively. A slew of progressive Muslims groups and secular bodies have also come out in support of Shayara Bano in the court.

There is a strong case for reform of Muslim personal laws, but it needs to be pursued carefully and with the broad-based support of the community. In the Shayara Bano case, the Centre has held the view that the said practices are not an integral part of Islam. This could be taken to mean that they are subject to executive intervention. Yet, the way in which the debate has often been framed in the dominant narrative is disquieting, and stokes insecurity and fear in large sections of the minority community. Overlooking the vivid argument and disagreement even within Muslim groups on the subject of triple talaq, for instance, a neat opposition is painted between a conservative monolithic religion on the one hand and modern ideas of social and gender equality on the other. The conservatism espoused by sections of the clergy and the community has been held up as evidence of Muslim backwardness. The fact is, the call for reforms has periodically been raised from within the community, be it in the Shah Bano case in the 1980s or the Shayara Bano case now.

Entrenched political interests tend to assume custodianship of community interests, feeding on real and imagined fears, and invite maximalist positions. Moreover, the pursuit of reform of Muslim personal laws has far too often been guided by the exigencies of electoral politics. In such a context, the onus of proving its good intentions is on the government. It needs to tread very carefully, while addressing the disquiet among sections of the Muslim community on a fraught question."

(File Photo)
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Monday told the Supreme Court that talaq and polygamy are integral parts of the religion of Sunni Muslims and the court cannot alter the sanctity of personal laws.
Adducing its written submissions in a bunch of matters that have challenged the validity of triple talaq and polygamy, the board said Islam was one of the first religions to grant equal rights to women and it was a misconception that women were discriminated against in marriage and divorce.
“Talaq, Halala and Polygamy are all integral parts of the religion of Sunni Muslims following four schools of thought provided by the Holy Quran and thus being essential to the religion of Islam are protected by virtue of Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution,” it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The organisation contended that Muslim Personal Law was a cultural issue inextricably interwoven with the religion of Islam. Thus, it was the issue of freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion guaranteed under Article 25 and 26 read with Article 29 of the Constitution.
The written submission, settled by senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, said the apex court ought not to venture into the area of changing personal laws by following a trend in other countries, as such a move would be in conflict with the democratic principles as enshrined in the Indian Constitution."

Urging his party to work relentlessly for the socio-economic transformation of society, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday said the BJP should address the concerns of Muslim women not by creating conflict, but through discussions. Modi also said the proposed new constitutional body for the socially and educationally backward would benefit backward classes among all communities, including Muslims.
“When we refer to social justice, it means Muslims should also get justice. No injustice to anyone. But it should not be done by creating conflict, but we should try and get justice for all through dialogue,” Union Minister Nitin Gadkari quoted the Prime Minister as having said in his speech concluding the BJP’s two-day national executive.
Modi’s reference to justice in the Muslim community is being seen as his intervention in the ongoing debate over triple talaq. He is learnt to have said that several Muslim women were victims of triple talaq, and the party should reach out to them. “If Muslim women want to fight this, (BJP) workers should stand by them,” the PM was quoted as saying by a BJP leader.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said that earlier in the day, intervening during a discussion in the national executive over the proposed constitutional status for the National Commission for Backward Communities, Modi said the new body would be beneficial not just for backwards among Hindus, but among all communities, including Muslims.
The National Executive has passed a resolution hailing Modi and his government for bringing the Bill to give constitutional status to the commission for backward communities, a move seen as part of the BJP’s effort to keep backward communities with it.
Modi, who was addressing party workers for the first time after the recent Assembly election victories, spoke at length about the ideal conduct of a party worker. Dealing with victory and maintaining balance would be tougher than handling defeat, because one becomes vulnerable in the former situation, he said, and warned that the repeated victories must not be allowed to go to their heads.
“He (the PM) said the Opposition would keep manufacturing issues for you. They keep raising the issue of intolerance. They manufacture issues like the attacks on churches ahead of the last Delhi election, returning of the awards ahead of the Bihar polls, and now they raise allegations of tampering of EVMs. You don’t need to pay any attention to such manufactured issues. Keep focusing on the spirit of our work,” Gadkari said.
According to a source, the PM has strictly told workers not to be “motormouths” — if there are issues that need to be addressed, they should try to talk to leaders in their respective areas. The PM also told party leaders that they should “learn the art of keeping quiet”, the source said.
Modi described Amit Shah as the BJP’s “Chanakya”, the economist, teacher, philosopher, jurist and adviser to emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Shah, Modi said, had put in huge effort to strengthen the party across the country in what has become a case study for political pundits.
While Shah in his inaugural address on Saturday maintained that the party would have its golden era only when it wins all states and transforms the country at all levels, Modi on Sunday said the BJP should see that the “country takes a long jump and transform society” by 2022, the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence.
A new India — where political vision is based on Jandhan, Vandhan and Jaldhan — must be created, the PM said. The slogans will be P2 (Pro-people Pro-active) and G2 (Good Governance), he told party leaders.
“We have to build a nation where we can ensure social and economic equality and where no discrimination will be made on the basis of caste status,” the PM was quoted saying.
Citing Mahatma Gandhi’s efforts to build the momentum for the freedom struggle from the 1920s to 1942, Modi asked BJP leaders to build an atmosphere for change through the Deendayal Upadhyay Garib Kalyan Yojana. The political resolution passed by the conclave also talked about the government’s pro-poor initiatives.
The meeting passed a special resolution felicitating the PM for the Constitution amendment Bill to provide constitutional status to the NCBC. It slammed the Congress and other Opposition parties for “delaying” the Bill — which was passed by Lok Sabha, but had to be referred to a Select Committee in Rajya Sabha where the NDA lacks majority.
“The BJP has always been committed towards building a society where everyone has equal opportunities and nobody is treated inferior… Justice needs to be delivered to every citizen without any bias or prejudice,” the resolution said.
It said that with the BJP taking steps to bring equality, the Congress and other parties were disappointed. “These parties have always suppressed the interest of the backward classes of the society and only gave them false hopes,” the resolution said the Congress stand in Rajya Sabha showed its “real attitude towards the backward classes”.
The resolution urged party workers to “take a pledge and make efforts towards making backwards aware about their constitutional and legal rights”."

It locks lives in, it locks lives out. Muslimwomen are truly the twice-forgotten, the minority within the minority. Whilestereotypes often based on prejudice proliferate, there is very littleaccurate knowledge about a community of women that number some 60 million.What are the specific problems they face? How do they cope with them? Whatare the safeguards provided by the law with regard to these women? Howeffectively are these laws being implemented?
It is to seek answers to these questions that the National Commission forWomen held special hearings with Muslim women from all over the country. Incities like Tezpur and Thiruvanathapuram, Chennai and Aligarh 13 venues inall meeting were held over a period of two and a half years. A reportbased on these hearings, `Voice of the Voiceless’, was released a few daysago. While it is by no means a definitive account on the status of Muslimwomen in the country, it provides valuable clues to the reality of theselives.
The first aspect that came through was the overwhelming poverty that thesewomen had to contend with. The great majority of women who participated inthese hearings lived in crowded mohallas and fetid bastis. This is nosurprise, seeing that income levels among Muslims, as a community, was farlower than those in other religious communities. According to the IndiaHuman Development Report 1999, quoted in this document, the per capitaincome of Muslims in rural India was around Rs 3,678 as compared to Rs 4,514for Hindus.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
What was also equally apparent in most human development surveys is therelatively lower participation of Muslim women in the workforce (around 16per cent as compared to 31 per cent for Hindu women). Literacy remainselusive for the great majority of Muslim girl children, whose lives continueto be dominated, not by the 3 `R’s but by the 3 `C’s: choola, chaadar andchaardeewari (the stove, the purdah and the four walls).
These already fragile lives were made even more insecure by the regularoutbreaks of communal violence. Women in Chennai and Ahmedabad narrated howthey were often the targets of communal frenzy victimised by both therioters and the police. Often, in their experience, police personnel bargedinto homes and took away male members of the family without bothering toeven produce an arrest warrant. And when the men were taken away, sources ofincome for the family also quickly dried up.
Ultimately, it is the women who bear the backlash of communal disturbances.For instance, women in the Hyderabad slum of Hafiz Baba Nagar complained howthe observance of purdah have become much stricter after the fall of BabriMasjid. Sociologists have pointed out that women especially women ofminority communities were invariably the symbolic repository of groupidentities. Therefore in moments when group identities came under threat, itwas the women who were required to live even more strictly according to thenorms laid down by the community at large.
Then there was the persecution from within the family. Listen to the voiceof Lateefa, speaking in Chennai last December: “I live in a kabristan(graveyard). My husband has left. My children work.I received no mehr, nomaintenance. He has remarried.” Or to that of Imdaad Bibi speaking at theAhmedabad hearing two months ago: “It is difficult to have the courage totalk. But our men have led us to a point when we must break the silence. Iam from Bareilly. I was given talaq after three years of my marriage…”Interestingly, although dowry was never a cultural practice in thecommunity, it has now become common enough.
The `Voice of the Voiceless’ Report notes: “Postal talaq and triple verbaltalaq was widespread…Dowry is a growing menace; one of its saddest fallouts was the growing incidence of teenage girls being married to old menfrom the Gulf in exchange for lumpsum payment to their destitute families.”(Tomorrow: Does the future hold change?)"

Governments will come and governments will go. The people are concerned not so much with governments as they are with governance. The hallmark of a government is its priorities.
The Central government will complete three years in May 2017. A few weeks ago, a new government assumed office in India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, that is home to one out of five Indians. The development of Uttar Pradesh, or the lack of it, has a huge impact on India’s development indicators. I venture to say that the priorities of the Central government and of the government of the largest state — especially when the same party is in power in both capitals — cannot be different.
No government starts on a clean slate. It inherits certain policies and programmes from the previous government(s) which the new government may continue or modify or abandon. Besides, there are structural issues that must be addressed by successive governments. The new government must also find the resources to implement its declared policies and programmes. I think it is fair to assume that every government tries to do its best. Whether a government has succeeded or not is a question that must be answered by the people.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As the NDA government is about to complete three years, we have important reports/official data. They are: Data of RBI; Data of Index of Industrial Production (IIP); Second Advance Estimates of National Income and Expenditure; Three Quarterly Employment Reports.
I shall share with you the main conclusions.
The bitter truth
1. The RBI data is for the period January 2015 to January 2017, that is 24 months. During this period, gross bank credit to all industries increased by a meagre Rs 7,413 crore or 0.29 per cent. This includes micro, small, medium and large industries. That is why manufacturing (in terms of capacity utilisation or adding new capacity) and job growth are in the doldrums.
2. There is confirmation from the IIP data. Between January 2015 and January 2017, the IIP increased by a mere 1.1 per cent from 189.2 to 191.3.
3. There is further confirmation from the estimates of national income and expenditure. In 2015-16, growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) was 6.11 per cent. In 2016-17, the growth rate of GFCF declined sharply to 0.57 per cent.
4. And, finally, the employment data also brings dismal news. Three reports have been released so far by the Labour Bureau. The reports use the data gathered from eight non-farm sectors: manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation, IT/BPO, education and health. The first report was a baseline survey as on April 1, 2016. The eight sectors employed about two crore workers. The second and third reports covered the first two quarters of 2016-17 (April to September, 2016). During Q1, the eight sectors added 77,000 jobs and in Q2, they added 32,000 jobs, making a total of only 109,000 jobs, notwithstanding Make in India and Skill India.
Irrelevant issues
The state of the economy is a result of external factors, legacy issues, structural problems, policy decisions, regulatory efficiency, institutional strengths and weaknesses, and administrative capacity. The government of the day is primarily accountable, but the purpose of this column is not to lay blame but to ask a question: what are the priorities of the government of the day?
The answer stares at us. Open any newspaper or watch any TV news channel. The headlines that scream at our faces are about illegal slaughterhouses, gau raksha vigilantism, closure of liquor vends, anti-Romeo squads, racial attacks on black Africans, clashes on university campuses, Aadhaar made mandatory, triple talaq, building a Ram temple at Ayodhya, counterfeit Rs 2,000 notes etc. Rarely does one find a mention of investment, credit growth or jobs.
Three priorities
The priorities of any government in the present situation should be
(1) greater investment, especially private investment;
(2) robust growth of bank credit, especially to the credit-starved micro, small and medium businesses; and
(3) generation of jobs, especially in the job-creating industries and services.
The three priorities are closely inter-related. Investment and credit — either both grow or both languish. Both depend largely on the ‘animal spirits’ of the entrepreneurs who are private citizens. Just as the foreign investor has many choices of investment destinations (India being just one), the big Indian investor has at least a dozen options. Micro, small and medium businesses may not have the option of investing abroad, but they have the option of not investing more money at all!
Large businesses can borrow from the bank or the market, but micro, small and medium businesses are entirely dependent on bank credit. Growth of bank credit is usually a good measure of growth of investment. The bitter truth is that during the two-year period (2015 and 2016), both investment and bank credit have been languishing.
The inevitable fallout is increased unemployment. That is proven by the data from the Labour Bureau. Creation of only 109,000 jobs in a six-month period in eight non-farm sectors (that provide the bulk of non-farm jobs) is an indication of the poor state of the economy. This must be viewed against the promise to create two crore jobs every year.
We need to get our priorities right. We need to hear less talk and see more action on investments, credit and jobs. We also need less noise on matters that are irrelevant to the health of the economy."

A substantive issue relates to the “governance” and “disciplining” of women by repressive patriarchal and religious structures. Irrespective of which religion or culture regulates the lives of women in our country, it intentionally controls their individuality and their entitlements, subjecting them to a brutish life. Imrana, Gudiya, Sonia, and innumerable unnamed others are subjected to repression, violence, abuse and injustice due to their gender or their caste. They do not have much recourse to laws or protective measures, and so receive neither justice nor protection.
It seems that Indian women (and a few good men, perhaps) are destined to keep fighting the same battles over and over again. Gudiya, if we remember, was forced against her wish to return to her first husband who had been given up for dead in Kargil. In the meanwhile, she was married to another man and conceived  his child. A headline reporting her death read: “A Kargil POW’s wife Gudiya dies in Delhi.” In this very sentence, the first husband is privileged and valorised as a national hero (the emphasis being on Kargil and on his POW status) while Gudiya, the sufferer, is reduced merely to the status of “his wife”. The fact that she accepted her status unwillingly is thus obliterated. So is the fact that she was the heroine, albeit tragic, and that her husband was a nonentity who did not have the grace to leave her with the husband she wished to be with.

Indeed, the two “husbands” stayed mute witnesses to her fate being sealed by village elders, who were ostensibly following “Islamic” principles. Equally reprehensible were the TV channels cashing in on her plight at the time, exhorting her to make her choice between the two husbands on camera, with millions watching. Gudiya’s death is as much a result of the traumas inflicted on her as any physiological damage she might have suffered over a miscarriage or abortion.

It is time that the silence brokered between all religious communities, majority or minority, is questioned. The tolerance of religions that oppress should no longer be allowed to hide under the garb of maintaining the sanctity or identity of religious communities. The “secularist” platform of non-interference of the state and other interested stake-holders in aspects of tradition and religion governing gender and caste relations is in the long run detrimental to society. Religious communities can maintain their tenets, their cultural distinctiveness in sundry other ways, rather than being tools with which to oppress their own, especially women. The soft peddling of religious sensibilities and politically correct stands, whatever “good” values they may purport to protect, can no longer be an excuse to suppress the basic rights of women.

Women are often the terrain on which turf fights between men — for power politics, religion and economics — are fought. Whether it is sati, or triple talaq or the age at marriage, societies and communities have made women, and their behaviour, their own rights, the sites on which power equations are renegotiated and cultural and religious identities refashioned. And to prove that a religion or a community is inferior to another, it is the hypocritical fashion to shout from housetops how badly the other religion treats its women. Both major religions forget that they are equally culpable — unacknowledged multiple wives are common among Hindus and inheritance rights are equally poor among both religions. Purdah or the seclusion of women is practiced among both communities and Dalit women are treated as badly by Hindus as poor women among the Muslims.

Rarely has the voice of women been sought in changes which affect them, let alone in other affairs of society. Instead, patriarchal society has devised innumerable ways of controlling women, their sexuality, their pain and pleasure, their reproductive abilities, their mobility and even their minds. Hence, the abject capitulation of a Gudiya or an Imrana. Resistance often leads to retaliatory violence and a worse fate — Bhanwari Devi in Rajasthan being a case in point. Since traditional customs and religious injunctions rarely support the woman, civil society and the state need to work together to devise a civil code that will protect her.

Here, Immanuel Kant’s definition of public and private reason is useful. Kant argued that the use of public reason was necessary to further individual human freedoms. An enlightened individual or society is only so when it has the courage to critique accepted wisdoms and traditions which are restrictive of universal human freedom and dignity. By not speaking out on issues that are considered to be “private”, such as those of caste and gender, and not allowing these to be within the purview of reason, we perpetuate existing iniquitous structures of society.

Finally, the voyeurism and power of media, especially of television, needs to be self-regulated. The shoving of television cameras into Gudiya’s face in her most difficult moments could only have added to her state of ill-being. That the fate of the victim after the “breaking story” is no longer news bothers the conscience of no one. Unethical intrusion into people’s lives, through sting operations or by bringing their most private dilemmas into the public glare, deteriorates the human integrity of the individual and the family. Let the imagination of art and cinema bring to us the fragility of the human condition, its confusions and its struggles; but let us not do this by rudely intruding into and by irrevocably changing the lives of people who we do not and cannot really care about.

Prominent Islamic organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind on Friday told the Supreme Court there is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law in which triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy are well rooted and stand on much higher pedestal as compared to other customs. In its counter affidavit, the Jamiat stated that the Muslim Personal Law has an element of certainty and is not local or regional in operation.

“There is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law, which is based on primarily the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, explained and applied by various scholars of great antiquity and authority after thorough research,” it said.
“The protection of peculiarities in personal laws is necessary for securing freedom of religion and bringing uniformity by removing those peculiarities shall be enforcement of Uniform Civil Code by the judicial process, which shall be against the constitutional bar,” it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Relying on various apex court judgements, it said that Fundamental Duties as in the Constitution does not not touch upon the personal laws of the parties.
“In personal laws, new concepts of modern times should not be evolved by the courts and it should enforce the law as derived from recognised and authoritative sources of personal laws except where such law is altered by any usage or customs or is modified or abrogated by statute,” the Jamiat said.
In its counter affidavit, the Jamiat has also said “the Muslim Personal Law stands on a much higher pedestal when compared to customs or practices because the former has element of certainty and is not local or regional in operation.”
Referring to Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the affidavit said that it has highlighted that Muslim women should be allowed to be governed by Muslim Personal Law instead of local customs and practices because the Muslim Personal Law treats “women with greater dignity”.
The Muslim body further said women who have approached the apex court on the issue should approach regular civil courts seeking adjudication of validity of divorce granted to them in the light of the law already settled by the Supreme Court.
The affidavit further said, ‘nikah halala’, which is surrounded by various misconceptions and when the talaq becomes absolute and irrevocable then the former husband and wife immediately fall in prohibited degree and they cannot remarry each other.
“However, if subsequently she enters into marriage with another man and the said marriage is also dissolved by any mode prescribed by Islam only then she can marry her former husband by way of fresh nikah,” it said.
The affidavit said, “Muslim women enjoy greater freedom as there is no compulsion on the wife to remarry the same man or to contract any further marriage at all”.
Earlier, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had rubbished the stand taken by the Centre that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental right like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
Government, for the first time, had opposed the practice in the apex court and said, “The issue of validity of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy needs to be considered in the light of principles of gender justice and the overridin principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality.”"

During the next five months, BJP is set to hold a number of programmes to strategically reach out to voters from different sections, including Muslim women. These programmes will be organised between April 24 to September 25, to mark the birth anniversary of party ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay. From September 1 and 15, BJP’s Alpsankhyak Morcha will organise seminars on triple talaq, preferably in madrasas, where experts on women rights will address Muslim women on their legal rights and also counsel them on empowerment.
In its manifesto for the UP polls, BJP had promised to take up the ‘triple talaq’ issue — currently pending in the Supreme Court — depending on what Muslim women desire. Now, after coming to power, the BJP government plans to start collecting opinion of women on the issue. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already directed women ministers to hold meetings with concerned organisations.
UP president of Alpsankhak Morcha, Haider Abbas Chaand, said: “The seminars will be held in madrasas and other places, which Muslim women could visit comfortably. Senior leaders, including experts on women rights, will tell them why triple talaq is wrong and what legal options they have.” Programmes will also be organised to empower victims of triple talaq, he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP has also decided to come up with a list of blood donors. On August 14, the party will organise blood donation camps, where a maximum of 100 units of blood would be collected at each booth. “Following this, the blood groups of the remaining donors would be checked but their blood would not be collected. Their contact details, along with their blood groups, would be compiled into a list to create a directory. When in need, they could come to the use of those in medical emergency,” said party UP vice-president Ashwani Tyagi, who is also a part of the 11-member committee set up to supervise these programmes.
Party state president and Deputy Chief Minister Kashav Prasad Maurya, along with state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, are also in the committee. The party, moreover, has asked its youth wing to organise sports meets and programmes where young singers, writers, painters and musicians could participate.
The party women wing has been asked to hold functions at districts, where poor girls have either got good jobs or brought laurels to their families and districts through their achievements in the field of sports. “These programmes will connect the people with BJP emotionally. Also, a health camp will be organised for women,” said a BJP leader.
While the party’s Scheduled Caste Morcha will organise career counseling sessions for students in villages, the Kisan Morcha will organise seminars for farmers. Moreover, from May 26 to June 30, party workers will participate in ‘Mera Ghar-BJP Ka Ghar’ programme, in which they will make door-to-door visits at every booth and put up party flags at all houses. Programmes will also be held to felicitate veteran leaders associated with the party from the days of Jan Sangh. “Felicitation of these veteran leaders, who had worked for the party during averse periods, will encourage the young workers to work with dedication,” Tyagi said.
At the regional level, the party will organise general knowledge competitions in schools for students of Class VIII, IX and X from August 15 to 30. The winners will be rewarded with books. From April 24 to May 7, workshops will be held for party workers at district and regional levels. Meanwhile, Garib Kalyan Mela will be organised from September 22 to 25, in which stalls will be put up to make people aware of the welfare schemes introduced by the Centre and the UP government."

Many Muslim countries, including Pakistan, have               put so many obstacles in the practice of triple talaq that the men               have to perforce go for the ‘‘singles talaq’’               (talaq repeated at monthly intervals twice). Why could the board               not go for similar bold measures? A leadership which cannot prevail               upon the community to prefer the procedure for talaq as given in               the Quran rather than continue with a practice that started only               after the time of the Prophet, should rethink its relevance.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday backed Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu’s assertion that triple talaq was “anti-constitutional and anti-civilisation” and said that this system must be abolished to protect the rights of Muslim women.
“What Naidu ji has said is absolutely correct; we are all sworn to the Constitution of India. The Constitution of India says that there should be gender quality and triple talaq doesn’t give gender equality,” BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said.

“It differentiates between Indian women on the basis of religion. Therefore, to protect the rights of Muslim women triple talaq must be abolished,” he added.
Describing ‘triple talaq’ as anti-constitutional and anti-civilisation, Naidu on Saturday said it’s time the country should abolish this “gender discrimination” in the light of principles of justice, dignity and equality.

“Triple talaq is anti-constitutional, against law, against the principles of democracy and anti-civilisation.
This kind of opinion is on the rise. There is a discussion going on, on this subject. Already so much of time has been taken. It is time the country should move forward to abolish ‘triple talaq’ to end the discrimination and also have gender justice and equality before law. We should end this,” Naidu said.
He also suggested that as the Supreme Court is currently scrutinising the issue, anybody can go and voice their concerns."

HOURS AFTER Prime Minister Narendra Modi broached the issue of triple talaq and urged Muslims not to view the issue from a political perspective, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Modi has been the “biggest champion of politicising” the issue. He also asked the BJP not to try and create a new vote bank by driving a wedge between Muslim women and their husbands.
“The Prime Minister has said that the issue should not be politicised. I want to ask the Prime Minister, who is politicising it? He is the biggest champion of politicising it,” the Congress leader said on Saturday. “He started it, and to (now) say ‘don’t politicise it’ itself is politicising it…. Have you ever heard any leader of AIADMK, DMK, BJD, JD(U), Samajwadi Party, BSP, Congress or the TMC talking about it?”
Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said Modi is aiming at something else while talking about the triple talaq issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Azad said, “Give me the name of one political leader of any political party who initiated the discussion….(But) leaders of the BJP – right from the Prime Minister, and those of the RSS, from worker to pracharak – run this agenda (all the time), both before and after elections. Other parties have been talking in response to that; suo motu no political party has talked about it.”
He said, “Instead of advising others, the PM should restrain himself and control his party.”
As time evolves, all people — whether Hindus, Muslims or Christians — keep the good aspects of their religion and features that are not appropriate get phased out, Azad said. In Islam too, he added, aspects associated with the Quran will remain, while those “made by the maulvis or mullahs will not”.
He said, “When the society is already discussing it, and the matter is pending before the court, BJP ko khamakhan main Muslim aurat aur Muslim pati ke beech main ye naya vote bank banane ki koshish nahin karni chahiye (BJP should not unnecessarily raise this topic to create division between Muslim women and their husbands to create a new vote bank).”"

(Representational photo)
In India, Triple Talaq has been a bone of contention. Under the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act (1937), Triple Talaq – a practice that has been discarded by several Muslim majority countries, including Turkey, Pakistan and Bangladesh – still exists in India. Up until now, it was maintained that when it came to marriage, divorce and other personal rifts, the state would not interfere, and the religious law would be the prevailing authority.
In the name of tradition, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB ) finds triple talaq or talaq given in one sitting, sacrosanct and crucial, particularly for women. In September 2016, the AIMPLB defended the religious tradition of triple talaq stating the law actually ‘protected’ women since it prevented husbands from resorting to murder. In an affidavit, it stated: “If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive.”
The issue of Triple Talaq, therefore, has been a significant, yet controversial issue. Talaq (repudiation) finds its roots in Arabic, where the word means “undoing of or release of a knot”. It is derived from the word ‘tallaqa’ which means “to free” an animal from tether. To repudiate a woman implies that the husband is ‘releasing’ her from the ‘bondage’ of marriage. Announcing a dissolution of marriage must be done clearly – there should be no ambiguity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Islamic law recognises two kinds of talaqs – Talaq al-sunna (which works according to the dictates of the Prophet) and Talaq al-bidat (which was an innovation, born out of inconvenience of the strict dictates of the Prophet). The latter was divided into two forms – one was the declaration of ‘talaq’ three times (that is, triple talaq) and the other was divorce done through writing. In Understanding the Islamic Law of Divorce, Research Associate at the Indian Law Institute Prof. Dr. Furqan Ahmad writes, that Talaq al-bidat emerged during the second century, when Omayyad rulers found that the laws “imposed by the Prophet on the facility of repudiation interfered with indulgence of their caprice and endeavored to find an escape from the strictness of law.” Ahmad further writes, “It must be noted that it was not Islam, but Omayyad practices that gave validity to these divorces.”
Tradition dictates that religious laws should be preserved. Unlike India however, there are several Muslim majority nations where triple talaq has been banned.
Pakistan and Bangladesh
Pakistan’s Muslim Family Law Ordinance (1961) was a watershed moment in the country’s history, which altered the martial laws in Pakistan and made the customary triple talaq, illegal. This law has been adopted by Bangladesh as well. Eminent scholar Prof. Dr. Mumtaz Ahmad wrote in The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of Pakistan, “The Muslim Family Law Ordinance was the first legal effort in Pakistan to codify Muslim personal law…The new law required that, in order to obtain a divorce, a husband had to send a written notice to the chairman of the local council with a copy to his wife. But the divorce will not be effective until the expiration of a waiting period of 90 days, which will be utilized to constitute an arbitration council for the purpose of bringing about a reconciliation between the parties.”
Muslim Family Law Ordinance (1961) came into being through a controversial event. It began in 1955, when Pakistan’s then Prime Minister, Muhammad Ali Bogra, who was already married, went ahead and married his secretary Aliya Saadi, without the permission of his first wife, Hamida. Offended by the flippant manner in which the leader of the country dealt with the institution of marriage, Hamida Bogra refused to accept everything in silence. She joined forces with the wives of Pakistan’s elite who were members of the All Pakistan Women’s Association (APWA) that held nationwide protests against the Prime Minister and polygamy. The campaign eventually transformed into a vehicle for change, where women in Pakistan demanded reforms in Muslim family laws.

Following this, the Commission on Marriage and Family Laws was established that same year, that demanded changes in the existing marriage and divorce laws. It demanded, “the proper registration of marriages and divorces, the right to divorce exercisable by either partner through a court or by other judicial means, maintenance and the establishment of special courts to deal expeditiously with cases affecting women’s rights.” It also strongly underlined that, “a reconstruction in the light of the spirit of the Quran and Sunnah is not only permissible, but is a duty imposed on the Muslims to make Muslim society adaptive, dynamic and progressive.” The demands and alterations suggested by the Commission were respected and were incorporated through the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961.

Turkey is one of the most secular Muslim nations in the world. In Turkey, up until 1917, divorce could only be done by the man, by simply saying “talaq, talaq, talaq” – which is still accepted as Islamic tradition in India. In 1926, however, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Islamic laws of marriage and divorce (grounded in the Quran) were abolished and the modern Swiss Civil Code (a highly progressive Civil Code in Europe) was adopted. This was part of the reorganisation Ataturk undertook as the founder of the Republic of Turkey between 1926 and 1929, which introduced a gamut of progressive social reforms. Among the most significant were the acknowledgment of equality of the sexes, civil marriage and divorce, abolition of polygamy and unilateral repudiation. At that time, while the abolition of the Sharia law was accepted and embraced by the Turkish elites, it was opposed by Islamic authorities.
This civil code was further adopted by Cyprus as well.
Egypt
In 1929, Egypt was the first country to adopt a modern perspective held by scholar Ibn Taimmiyah (1268-1328) and theologian Ibn alQiyam (1292-1350), with regard to the personal laws on marriage and family. Both Ibn Taimmiyah and Ibn alQiyam declared that repeating “talaq” three times would only be considered as the first step in the overall three-step process of divorce. “Egypt was the first country to deviate from the position of jamhur (the majority of Muslim Jurists) in 1929, when it provided that a divorce accompanied by a number expressly or implied, shall count only as a single divorce and such a divorce is revocable except when three talaqs are given, one in each tuhr,” wrote Prof. Dr. Mumtaz Ahmad. Tuhr, is the period of ‘purity’, that is, when the wife is not menstruating. In 20th century, over 20 countries adopted this decree, including Syria, Jordan and Iraq.
Sri Lanka
Muslims, particularly in countries where they are a minority (like India), tend to be resistant to change. They try to (and understandably so) protect and preserve their religious laws. Sri Lanka, however, where the Muslim community (mostly Sunnis) is 9.7 percent of the total population, is a country that does not support or accept triple talaq. It has the Marriage and Divorce (Muslim) Act 1951, which states that a husband who wishes to dissolve his marriage can only do so by giving a “notice of his intention to the Qazi”. Subsequently, it is the Qazi who first attempts to initiate a reconciliation process between the husband and wife, which involves the assistance of relatives and family elders. Reconciliation period is a period of 30 days, after which, if differences between the spouses are still not resolved, the husband has the liberty to declare talaq, but only in the presence of two witnesses and the said Qazi.
Tunisia and Algeria
As a country, Tunisia has a progressive Code of Personal Status (1956), where a divorce is not valid outside the court of law. More importantly, a divorce is not given unless and until the court has looked into the causes for the fissures in the relationship, validated them and is assured that no reconciliation can be done.

Similarly, in Algeria, divorce can only be given by the court, after an attempt at reconciliation has been made. The reconciliation period cannot exceed the duration of three months."

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday termed triple talaq a “burning” issue and said in a developing country like India, women cannot be treated as “secondary” citizens. He also favoured wide discussions on the contentious issue of ‘Uniform Civil Code’ and said in case a consensus emerges, nobody should have any problem with it as even the framers of the Constitution wanted that the state shall “endeavor” to implement it to empower every citizen.
Watch what else is making news: 
“Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar had assured everyone’s empowerment in the Constitution, be it women or anyone else… You must be agreeing with the fact that in a developing nation, we cannot leave women behind. We can not treat women as secondary citizens. This is not possible in any progressive society,” Singh said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Triple talaq is a burning issue of this time, is it in accordance of Article 44 of the Constitution? Only court will decide this,” he said at the Constitution Day celebration held at Patiala House Courts complex in New Delhi. “At times when there is a debate about triple talaq, some people say that there is an effort to impose Uniform Civil Code (UCC) on them. But as far as UCC is concerned, it is discussed in the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) of the Constitution,” Singh said.
Referring to the DPSP, he said, “the state shall endeavour to implement Uniform Civil Code for its citizens.” “I believe that there should be a discussion at national level. There should be a series of discussions on the issue and if there is any consensus, then, I think no one should have any problem,” he said.
The Union minister also said the government is mulling over the proposal of a National Litigation Policy which would help in reducing pendency of cases. Referring to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) he said it will bring a regime of ‘one nation, one tax’. He also took a dig at the imposition of Emergency, when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister, and said the period showed as what happens when fundamental rights are curbed and crushed."
"1617717035-36","https://indianexpress.com/page/122/?s=Triple+talaq","Reason for reform","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/reason-for-reform/","Reason for reform","September 15, 2004","The recently released census figures on religious groups kicked up enough bad faith to clog all possibilities of reasoned discussion. In the immediate aftermath, it seemed it would not be possible to salvage the issues from the bungled presentation of the figures themselves and then the BJP’s unabashed attempts to put them to instant political use. But the dust may be settling now. Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), has proposed that the Board talk about family planning and literacy in the Muslim community when it meets in December. The aim, he stressed, should be to emphasise that the community’s strength lay in the quality of life of its members, not in its numbers, and that the only way ahead is the one that leads to modernisation. Those sentiments and their unambiguous articulation in the public sphere are entirely welcome.
Maulana Kalbe Sadiq’s intervention has the potential to bring an introspective calm and defuse the escalating war of spectres — the Hindu at risk from the proliferating Muslim versus the besieged Muslim for whom Islam is forever in danger. The fact is that even the ‘‘adjusted’’ figures of the census show a worryingly high growth rate in the Muslim community even as it continues to lag behind all other groups in terms of literacy and employment. The fact is that those sets of statistics — high fertility rates, low literacy rates and high unemployment rates — are all tied together. But it has become extremely difficult to raise these secular concerns either in the national conversation or within the community for fear of crusading communalists on the one hand and knee-jerk secularists on the other.
The AIMPLB is not ‘the’ representative forum for the Muslim community. The Muslims are no monolith and must not be seen to be so for reasons of either convenience or bigotry. But it is also true that the Board has been making a visible effort in recent times to guide the debate towards issues of social reform and development. Recently, it took up the challenge of framing a model nikahnama. It may not have gone far enough — it did not prohibit the practice of triple talaq. But on triple talaq then, as on family planning and literacy now, the board can’t do it all. Others in the community must stand up and make themselves heard."

Pointing to the Woman and Child Development Ministry’s silence on the issue of marital rape in its Draft National Policy for Women 2016, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has said that marital rape should be recognised under the law.
In the light of the recent debate over abolishing triple talaq, the NCW has also objected to the ministry’s vaguely worded stand on the issue of personal laws in its recently released draft policy that states “given the plurality of personal laws a review is required”. The NCW has held that “the problem is not plurality”, adding that uniformity is not the answer but what is required is a reform of personal laws to ensure gender equality.

“The draft policy doesn’t have any reference to the issue of marital rape. Following our detailed consultations with lawyers, activists, rural women and women with disabilities, we decided to recommend to the ministry that the policy must acknowledge marital rape. Unless a beginning is made by recognising marital rape in the policy, we cannot go ahead and make laws to protect women from such offences,” NCW chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam told The Indian Express.
 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The WCD Ministry had given a reply in the Rajya Sabha earlier this year which read that “the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context” and that criminalising it will put “the entire family system will be under great stress”. Following the backlash against WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi after the statement, the ministry retracted its reply to the Rajya Sabha. The ministry’s amended answer only said that matter is being examined by the Law Commission without specifying the ministry’s stand on the matter of criminalising the act.
On the issue of triple talaq too, the WCD ministry has chosen to not take any stand so far even as the NCW has decided to file a reply, in the Supreme Court matter of Uttarakhand-based Shayara Bano, in support of banning the practice.
“Triple talaq cannot be unilateral. Even the Quran doesn’t recognise such a practice. But uniform civil code is not the solution. What is required is codification of the Muslim personal law. There has been resistance in the past when reforms were taken up in the Hindu and Parsi personal laws but such a codification is much required,” said Kumaramangalam.
The NCW has, in its correspondence to the WCD ministry on the draft policy, said “all personal laws foster gender-inequality in one form or another”. Ruling out uniformity as the answer, it states that what is required are “reforms based on gender-equality within personal laws of different kinds”."

JNU last year, DU now. What lessons are there to learn from such outrages on our campuses? If nothing else, one thing is abundantly clear — no one in the mainstream media seems quite to be getting it. The issue is not of FoE (Freedom of Expression), mine versus yours. Nor is it the muzzling of dissent on Indian campuses. Unfortunately, our captive mindsets so conveniently slot reality into what we already know, thus being unable to frame questions properly, or seek correct answers. If we care to examine these outrages dispassionately, without a prior investment in one politically determined outcome, a totally different picture might emerge, not only of what’s actually happening in India, but also how our analysis is the prisoner of category confusion.
Let’s start with ABVP, vaunted to be the world’s largest student organisation. Clearly, the cadres fell too easily into a well-laid trap. The first thing they should learn is not to charge like enraged bulls every time a red rag is waved in front of them. That red rag can be “anti-national” slogans, a beef festival or the denigration of a Hindu god(dess). Such provocations cannot be taken at face value; they are planted with the intention of causing unrest. The deeper pattern behind them should be exposed.
Watch What Else Is Making News

Speaking specifically of Ramjas College, the two invited “radicals,” Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid, neither of whom eventually spoke, possibly succeeded beyond their wildest dreams in destabilising. Evidently, they wanted to stir the proverbial hornet’s nest, transplanting the roils of JNU, HCU and Jadavpur to Delhi University, an ABVP-dominated campus. Some Left-sympathising teachers also propped up their cause.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But what they accomplished, without even going to Ramjas, was a veritable coup — the plan to incite student unrest across the country, especially during election time, almost fructified. Radical student bodies, whether ultra-left, Ambedkarite or Kashmiri separatist factions, always hope to create a wave of turbulence out of a whimper, a movement, if not a mountain, out of a molehill. The objective — to attack the Indian state and/or Hindu society, unleashing student discontent against the Modi sarkar, with the support of other political parties. In that sense, Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid seem to fit the classic definition of agents provocateurs. Such persons inflame their enemies into making mistakes, committing illegal acts, thus compromising their own cause. The whole organisation — this time, ABVP — ends up discredited.
But does this exonerate ABVP? Clearly not. When will they learn that resorting to fisticuffs or bending the law is the worst possible strategy to win public sympathy? I can think of a hundred other ways to fight such battles: The best would be to take on their political opponents in an open debate. But, assuming that they have neither the time, nor the intellectual inclination to do so, does that mean they would have run out of all other options? Why couldn’t they take a leaf out of their opponents’ playbooks? For instance, blocking the entrance to the college, lying down on the steps of the seminar hall, outshouting and outsmarting the separatist slogan-shouters?
The biggest takeaway for ABVP from this fiasco is that they need a complete makeover, including smarter spokespersons, more female faces and, above all, much better strategy on how to counter their ideological opponents. Why not learn from their senior partners, the BJP, who have effective envoys and image-makers at all levels? ABVP ends up as a motley, scruffy crew of rabble-rousers, who, barring a few notable exceptions, miserably fail to articulate their point of view. Worse, they make a virtue out of their ineffectiveness by denying they were tricked — some even thump their chests, proudly justifying their lumpenism.
In the ongoing fracas, what cannot be ignored is the incapacity of the left-liberal media to come to grips with the problem. Just to illustrate, let’s imagine what might happen if the boot was on the other foot: What if a morcha were taken out in Srinagar, Aligarh, even in Kolkata, in support of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons? Or a campaign organised on the premises of Muslim-dominated institutions against Muslim personal law? Culinary festivals highlighting porky delicacies? Even a procession with students shouting “Bharat Mata ki jai!” — would such operations be framed as freedom of expression vs the muzzling of dissent? Or, as unnecessary provocations inciting hatred?
Not long after Ramjas, Jamia Millia Islamia students did not allow an eminent invitee, Shazia Ilmi, to speak on triple talaq. Earlier, for years, they had blocked their vice-chancellor from discharging his duties, even visiting the campus, over allegedly controversial remarks in favour of Salman Rushdie. I never heard a single anchor hector his guests against the illiberalism on such campuses, citing how some unpopular motion in favour of pacifism was carried at the Oxford Union long ago or how, during the Iranian hostage crisis, in America, anti-US demonstrations were allowed under police guard. It’s a different matter that both in the UK and the US, hundreds of hate crimes are reported each year, some fatal: None of these societies is a model when it comes to guaranteeing the freedom of speech of non-celebrity dissenters.
Student organisations such as ABVP, the police, the political powers that be, the media, and we, the concerned citizens, all have lessons to learn from Ramjas. But if there is one common denominator, it is this — restore academics to our campuses and get party politics out. IITs, IIMs and other technical institutions seem to thrive without it. The then Bombay University banned student elections in 1992, following the murder of an NSUI candidate; they seem none the worse for it. Student government is wonderful for young people to learn leadership. But party-driven politics of the sort we have seen at our leading universities is like the kiss of death. Time to make a nation-wide change?

(File Photo) 
Gujarat High Court has asked a family court to decide expeditiously the application of a Muslim woman who wanted a formal divorce deed saying that her husband had given her ‘triple talaaq’. While the couple opted for triple talaaq consensually, the lower court denied a deed of divorce to the applicant Rashidaben Rassiwala under the Civil Procedure Code, saying this kind of talaaq was not legally valid.
Watch what else is making news:

Justice Sonia Gokani quashed family court’s order and directed it to decide the application afresh in eight weeks. Rashidaben married Abbas Latiwala in 2002. From 2010 they began to live separately, with Abbas marrying another woman. In 2015, Rashidaben filed a suit for a deed of divorce to formalise the ‘triple talaq’ given by her husband. Abbas endorsed her claim that they were divorced by mutual consent, using the triple talaaq procedure under the Sharia law.
The family court, however, rejected the application saying the ‘triple talaaq’ had no legal validity, and she had not furnished a clear proof of divorce. Rashidaben then moved the High Court, which in its order on January 25 set aside the family court’s order. “The petitioner lady is educated and is working as a teacher. The husband has already remarried after they separated. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that word ‘talaq’ has been thrice uttered,” the HC said, also noting that it had spoken to the couple to ascertain their wishes.
“They both needed this decree for the purpose of preparation of official documents. In absence of any provision like section 13-B of Hindu Marriage Act when decree by mutual consent is permissible…they adopted this (course of action),” the HC observed."

(Source: File)
Government on Friday rebuked the All India Muslim Personal Law Board for trying to “politicise” the law panel’s move to seek feedback on uniform civil code and said it should not be linked to ‘triple talaq’, where the core issue is gender justice and ending discrimination against women. Calling for an “enlightened debate” on Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the “real mood” of the country was to end triple talaq and some people were trying to create confusion over the two issues.
“You (All India Muslim Personal Law Board) join the debate. Let there be enlightened debate you put forth your point of view. Let a consensus be evolved. Why are you trying to bring in the name of Prime Minister and call him dictator,” Naidu told reporters. Government’s sharp reaction came a day after All India Muslim Personal Law Board and various other Muslim organisations announced that they will boycott Law Commission’s process to take views on the contentious Uniform Civil Code. They said the move amounted to the Modi government declaring “war” on their religious rights and that UCC will “kill” India’s pluralism.
Naidu said some people were confusing the issue of triple talaq with Uniform Civil Code. “The real mood of the country is that people want this triple talaq to end. People do not want any discrimination on basis of any religious faith agianst women. As I told you the issues are gender justice, non-discrimination and dignity of women,” he said. Criticising AIMPLB, Naidu even said, “If you are so interested in making political comments you can as well join any political party of your choice. This is not expected from Muslim Personal Law Board and other religious leaders. “You have to confine yourself to the issue and the issue is put forth for discussion by the law commission,” he added."

According to the model Nikahnama, which will be considered by the board at its annual session at Calicut on December 26, talaq without adequate reason and triple talaq is ‘‘gunah’’. ‘‘Ek saath teen talaq dena ya bina kisi makool sabab ke talaq dena sakht gunah hai (Pronouncing triple talaq at a time or giving divorce without any adequate reason is a grave sin),’’ the draft text of the model Nikahnama reads.
The guideline says the couple should settle their disputes in accordance with the Shariat (Islamic laws) and submit themselves to the power of the Almighty before thinking of separation. ‘‘They (husband and wife) should keep in mind that talaq is one of those things disliked by the Almighty,’’ the Nikahnama says. 
The model code adds that if the disputes persist, a senior member of the family/ ulema/eminent citizen should be called in to mediate. Divorce is allowed only if there was no other way out. But it should not be triple talaq as it is a sin, the model code adds."

Vishal Srivastav
The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will file a petition in the court demanding repoll in Uttar Pradesh using ballot papers and a ban on the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in future elections, party chief Mayawati said on Wednesday. She was addressing party functionaries here after paying tribute to BSP founder Kanshi Ram on his birth anniversary at Kanshi Ram Smarak Sthal. This was her first address to party workers after the BSP’s dismal performance in the assembly elections in which the party won only 19 seats.
Reiterating her allegation that the BJP had tampered with the EVMs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where the saffron party won with a landslide, Mayawati said that “BJP has killed democracy by bungling” and announced that BSP workers will hold dharna in every district of the state on 11th of every month, which will be observed as “black day”. The party, Mayawati said, will continue to hold such dharnas until its demand against the use of EVMs is not resolved through the courts.
She alleged that the BJP tampered with the EVMs in such a manner that votes cast in favour of other parties were registered as the BJP’s. In Punjab, Manipur and Goa — where the BJP didn’t perform well — she said that the BJP did not manipulate the EVMs as it would have been caught. In Punjab, she claimed, another reason for not tampering with the EVMs was the “lack of coordination between the Akali Dal and the BJP”.
She said it was suspicious that the BJP received votes in areas dominated by Dalits and Muslims. “BJP leaders are spreading misinformation that Muslim women voted for the BJP for its support to the demand of ending triple-talaq practice. Muslim women are connected to their religion. They will not trust the BJP. If the BJP had given tickets to 10-20 Muslim women, it would have made sense that Muslim women voted for it,” she said."

Defending the Centre’s stand on ‘triple talaq’, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said when over a dozen Islamic countries were regulating the practice by enacting laws, how could it be considered wrong for a “secular” country like India.
His remarks came a day after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board opposed the Centre’s affidavit in Supreme Court on the practice and also boycotted the Law Commission’s consultations on Uniform Civil Code (UCC).

“Over a dozen Islamic countries such as Pakistan, Tunisia, Morocco, Iran and Egypt have regulated triple talaq. If Islamic countries can regulate the practice by enacting law, and it has not been found against sharia, then how can it be wrong in India, which is a secular country?” Prasad told reporters here.
The minister, however, refused to comment on the issue of Uniform Civil Code.
“The Law Commission is considering it and has sought views of various sections of the society. Since it is under their consideration, I have nothing to say,” he maintained.
For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre had on October 7 opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds of gender equality and secularism.

The Law Ministry, in its affidavit, referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

BSP GENERAL secretary and party’s Muslim face, Naseemuddin Siddiqui, on Sunday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav are trying to interfere in the religious matters of Muslims’. He claimed that BSP president Mayawati is the only leader who has spoken in favour of Muslims on the issue of triple talaq. He was addressing Bhaichara Sammelan in Lucknow West Assembly seat, aimed at wooing Muslim voters. While BSP has fielded Arman Khan from the constituency, it is currently held by SP’s Rehan Naeem.

Siddiqui said Modi and BJP are interfering in the religious matters of Muslims by bringing up triple talaq. “If anyone has spoken against them, then it is behen Mayawati, who had said that it is the personal religious matter of Muslims and it should be left to them to take a call,” he told the gathering of mainly Muslims.
The Centre has opposed the tradition of instant triple talaq through an affidavit in the Supreme Court and BJP leaders, including the PM and BJP president Amit Shah, have voiced their opposition to the practice.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Mulayam Singhji kehte hain ki purdah galat ravayat hai (Mulayam says that purdah is a wrong tradition). This is written here in this newspaper,” he said while showing the crowd a copy of a Urdu daily. “It is our personal matter, why do you have to interfere? Our religious matters are being interfered with. One is talking about triple talaq, the other is talking about purdah,” he added.
Claiming that BSP is being defamed by rumours that it will form a coalition with BJP after 2017 UP elections, Siddiqui said: “But I, Naseemuddin Siddiqui, want to clarify today that there is no question of BSP forming a government with the BJP or having to do anything with that party… The BSP had never contested elections with BJP and did not compromise ideologically even when it formed governments with its support.”
Bringing up allegations levelled by SP state president Shivpal Yadav against cousin Ram Gopal Yadav in October, the BSP leader said: “Shivpal had said that Mulayam had abandoned the mahagathbandhan in Bihar after conniving with BJP because Ram Gopal’s son and daughter-in-law were facing a CBI inquiry. This is not what I am saying, this has been said by Shivpal.”
Siddiqui reiterated more than 400 communal riots have taken place during the SP regime while no such incident had occurred during the BSP rule. “The SP government has not fulfilled any promise it had made to Muslims in the party’s election manifesto. Forget about providing reservation to Muslims in proportion to their population, Mulayam Singh is not even talking about it. Muslim youths implicated in terror cases were not freed or provided compensation. On the contrary, Khalid Mujahid (accused in a terror case) was killed,” he alleged.
He claimed the project for Lucknow Metro was initiated by the previous BSP government. “It was better planned than the one implemented by the Akhilesh government. In our plan, the Metro was to be built underground and an elevated road was to be built above the road so that traffic could pass smoothly. Where the elevated road was to be constructed, they have built the tracks,” he added."

“We are fully satisfied with the commands of Islamic laws, especially on Islamic orders related to nikah, talaq (divorce) khula, fusqh and virasat (heritage). We are fully satisfied with and strongly deny the possibility of any type of change in them (sic),’’ it said.
Maulana Muhammad Maqsood Imran Rashadi, Khateeb and Imam of the Jama Masjid in Bengaluru, said the signatures of hundreds of individuals, including women, would be collected and sent to the AIMPLB for presentation in the Supreme Court.

“In the light of a campaign by 5,000 women seeking deletion of triple talaq, we are going to produce signatures of all the Ummah supporting triple talaq. The triple talaq is a statement of the Holy Quran. They are part of the rules from Allah,’’ Maulana Maqsood Imran said.
The imam said a questionnaire circulated by the law commission had 16 questions that seemed to indicate acceptance of a uniform civil code."

Hitting out at Centre over Law Commission’s move relating to triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code, a body representing Sunni Muslims today accused the government of making the move in view of UP elections and warned that the community will give befitting reply if it was implemented. The All India Tanzeem Ulema-a-Islam (AITUI) also staged protest over the issue in New Delhi, demanding the government to withdraw the “communal” move.
Watch what else is making news:

“The Commission is interfering in the personal laws of the Muslims. This is being done to polarise voters in view of the UP polls at the behest of the RSS. Any move to further the step will be given befitting reply by people during the 2017 polls. “We want the Commission to withdraw the step,” AITUI president Mufti Mohammed Ashfaq Hussain Qadri, said according to a statement.
The demonstrators also urged members of other minority communities such as Jain, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians to join the protest, saying “their rights too may be trampled upon”. “The UCC will affect personal laws of not only of Mulsims, but these communities too. So, they should also join us,” Maulana Shahabuddin Rizvi, general secretary of All India Jamat Raza-e Mustafa of Bareilly said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Making perhaps the first such move, the Law Commission had on October 7 sought feedback from public on whether the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional. In its affidavit submitted to Supreme Court on the same day, the Centre had also opposed before the apex court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims.
The government had said that triple talaq cannot be regarded as an essential part of the religion and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Ministry of Law and Justice, in the affidavit, referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

Escalation of a tussle between judiciary and government over appointment of judges for higher courts and rumblings within the Collegium over its “opaque” working dominated high-voltage events in 2016 in the Supreme Court, where the Modi government suffered huge embarrassment over central rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The government was also kept on tenterhooks after the televised announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as illegal tenders, with the apex court regularly expressing concern over its impact on the people and asking inconvenient questions.
Watch What Else Is Making News:

Though it refused to tinker with demonetisation, a batch of petitions challenging the move has been referred to a five-judge constitution bench for an authoritative pronouncement. Besides getting the flak on demonetisation, the BJP-led NDA government also got a shock treatment from the apex court for imposing President’s Rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, even as it was engaged in a war of words with the judiciary over appointment of judges for higher judiciary with each accusing the other of crossing the ‘Lakshmanrekha’.
The turf war between them that had begun last year after the quashing of the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC) Act escalated this year as the court first threatened to take up the issue of judges’ appointment in the judicial side but later took up a PIL and blamed the Centre for bringing the judiciary to a “grinding halt”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Emotion and high drama were witnessed over the issue as Justice T S Thakur, who will demit office as Chief Justice of India on January 3, broke down at a function attended by the Prime Minister while complaining about huge vacancies in judiciary.
He made light of the constant plea of the Centre that it was the collegium which was not finalising the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) on appointment of judges, saying non-finalisation of MoP was no ground for not appointing judges.
While it was grappling with the common criticism of the Collegium being opaque in functioning, a voice of dissent came from within as Justice J Chelameswar, part of the Collegium, wrote to the CJI, withdrew from collegium meetings and sought written notes on deliberations to decide on names for appointment as judges.
Amid all this drama, the supremacy of the top court’s judgements was questioned by its former judge Markandey Katju, who became the first apex court judge since its establishment on January 28, 1950, to be slapped with a contempt notice for allegedly using “intemperate” language and “scandalising” the judiciary through his blogs, after he appeared before a bench and embroiled himself in heated exchanges.
Besides these developments, the cash-rich BCCI had to bite the dust for its defiance in falling in line with the massive structural reforms recommended by the high-level panel comprising former CJI R M Lodha and two retired judges of the apex court.
The final blow came before the year end when BCCI President Anurag Thakur came on the firing line as the court threatened to initiate contempt and perjury proceedings with a warning that he may have to land in jail for interfering with the administration of justice.
While entertaining PILs, the apex court came in for an acid test when activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan through NGO Common Cause tried to drag the name of the Prime Minister accusing him of receiving money from two corporate houses which were raided by the income tax department in 2012-13.
However, his endeavour appears to be yielding no result, rather incurring the court’s wrath for seeking recusal of CJI -designate Justice J S Khehar who had questioned him for approaching the apex court with “zero material”. The Modi government also had a tough time dealing with the issues of appointment of Lokpal and the CBI director which came up before the apex court.
The government dared for the first time in India’s constitutional history to oppose the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook by the Supreme Court on grounds like gender equality and secularism which was opposed by various Muslim bodies.
The year also saw politicians like late J Jayalalithaa, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Subramanian Swamy and BJP President Amit Shah as the newsmakers from the Supreme Court as well.
Shah was among them to get a huge relief from the apex court which upheld the Bombay High Court decision giving him clean chit in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case by dismissing an appeal, a subsequent review and curative petitions."

A year after the RSS completed 90 years, its women’s wing has completed 80. Constituted on Vijaya Dashmi in 1936, the same day RSS was formed in 1925, the Rashtra Sevika Samiti is founded on the belief that “the Indian society is woven by the divine element a woman carries within her”.
The RSS does not have women in the parent organisation, on the ground that it has the separate unit for women. As in the RSS, it has fulltime members who shun family life and become pracharikas or sevikas. Daily shakhas are its “core unit” and have grown from 2,130 in 2011 to 2,784 in 2016.

To mark its anniversary, the Samiti is holding a three-day conference in Delhi to be attended by Goa Governor Mridula Sinha, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat and others. Ahead of the event, Samiti general secretary Seetha Annadanam, who joined in childhood and has been a pracharika since 1993, spoke to The Indian Express on a number of issues:
Marital rapehttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“There is nothing called marital rape. Marriage is a sacred bond. Coexistence should lead to bliss. If we are able to understand the concept of this bliss, then everything runs smooth.”
Challenges before women
“The main problems are women’s security, exploitation, dowry, ghunghat and female foeticide. The presence of an alcoholic man at home also causes problems. Men come home heavily drunk and don’t undertake family responsibility. The entire responsibility falls on women. There should be total prohibition across the country. We are working for promoting samskaras in the society.”
Social evils
“Social evils in our society are due to [foreign] invasion of 1,000 years. It will take time for society to come out of it. Women do not have strong social consciousness, hence there is low awareness. We have been doing our work for long, but did not get a chance to display social leadership and professional excellency. We are getting that today. Many women are now participating in social life, social activities. It was not there 50 years before. The mother is the nucleus of a family. If a mother gives proper direction for life to her children, then they move ahead in a good way.”
Triple talaq, uniform civil code
“Every woman must get uniform justice. Marriage is a bandhan, it lends security to her life. For her, triple talaq is dreadful. The problem has emerged from there [Muslim society], the solution too should come from there… We need an intellectual debate about what needs to be changed. Law is good, but those who implement the law must undergo a change to bring about the change in the society. In the Northeast, women do all kinds of work. Tribal women are empowered.”"

Amid a raging debate on uniform civil code, the law panel has sought public views on the subject to revise and reform family laws, saying the aim is to address social injustice rather than plurality of laws.

In an appeal issued on Friday, the Commission said the objective behind the endeavour is to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices even as it assured the people that the “norms of no one class, group or community will dominate the tone and tenor of family law reforms”.
In an accompanying questionnaire, the Commission has asked whether the existing personal laws and customary practices need codification and whether it would benefit people.
Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished, retained or retained with suitable amendments; and whether a uniform civil code should be optional are among 16 queries by the commission.
It has also sought to know whether the uniform code should include subjects like divorce, marriage, adoption, child custody, succession and inheritance.
It has asked people and stake holders as to whether a common code would infringe an individual’s right to freedom of religion.

“The Commission hopes to begin a healthy conversation about the viability of a uniform civil code and will focus on family laws of all religions and the diversity of customary practices, to address social injustice rather than plurality of laws,” law panel chairman Justice B S Chauhan (retd) said.
He said responding to the demands of social change, the panel will consider the opinions of all stake-holders and the general public to ensure that the “norms of no one class, group or community dominate the tone and tenor of family law reforms”.
Justice Chauhan said in the appeal that the family law reform has to view women’s rights as an end in itself rather than a matter of constitutional provision, religious right and political debate.
Indicating need for wider consultation before taking a call on a uniform civil code, the government had in June asked the Law Commission to examine the issue.
Implementation of a common code is part of the BJP’s election manifesto.
The move asking the law panel to examine the issue assumes significance as the Supreme Court had recently said it would prefer a wider debate, in public as well as in court, before taking a decision on the constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, which many complain is abused by Muslim men to arbitrarily divorce their wives.
However, a section of Muslim leaders have opposed any move to abolish triple talaq and other personal laws."

The Election Commission has recognised seven parties at the national level and 49 at the state level. The seven national parties are BJP, Congress, BSP, NCP, CPI, CPI(M) and Trinamool Congress.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Commission, after several rounds of deliberations, has formulated a questionnaire to understand what does the general public feel about the uniform civil code.
“Since political parties are the backbone of any successful democracy, their opinion, not only with regard to the questionnaire, but also any other input pertaining to this aspect, is very important,” law panel chairman Justice (Retd) B S Chauhan has written to heads of all political parties.
In an effort to have maximum consultation on the issue, he has asked them to communicate their views on the subject.
The Commission has said that it would also invite representatives of political parties at a later date to interact with them on the controversial subject.
“Your cooperation would go a long way in assisting the commission to bring out an impeccable report on the uniform civil code,” he said.
A few days ago, Chauhan had urged chief ministers to use their influence to encourage minority groups, political parties and even government departments to respond to its questionnaire.
In a letter to all chief ministers, Chauhan had asked them to “encourage” various stakeholders in their states such as minority groups, political parties, NGOs, civil society initiatives and even government departments and agencies to share their views and interact with the panel.
In an appeal issued along with the consultation paper, the Commission had said the objective behind the endeavour is to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be addressing the nation on Sunday through his monthly radio programme, Mann Ki Baat. The 31st edition of Mann Ki Baat will start at 11 am. Listeners can tune into All India Radio or watch the telecast on on Doordarshan. National public broadcaster Akashvani will broadcast the address in regional languages following the Hindi broadcast.
Earlier on Saturday, while addressing a function held in the honour of Kannada philosopher Basaveshwara, PM Modi touched on the triple talaq issue. “A hope is rising within me that powerful people will emerge from within the community who will break the traditions, demolish them and develop a modern system. Enlightened people from within the Muslim community will emerge and come forward to fight against all that Muslim daughters have to undergo. They will find a way out,” he said.
In the previous installment of Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Modi had said the people of the country wanted a ‘New India.’ “New India manifests the strength and skills of 125 crore Indians, who will create a Bhavya and Divya India,” he said. He added that the people of the country would contribute towards the development of India.
Expressing gratitude towards people for supporting the Digidhan movement. “Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, ‘Digidhan’ movement. There has also been an increase in curiosity about cashless transactions. The poorest of the poor are making an attempt to learn, and people are gradually moving towards doing businesses without cash,” he said."

In the ten years I’ve known her, she’s never been like this. Between her “Assalam-o-Alaikum, bhai” and what follows, there’s barely a moment’s gap. “Main do teen din se bahut pareshan hoon. Aap ko phone karne wali thee,” (I’ve been very disturbed over the last few days. I was planning to call you), says Tahera Apa.
What’s causing her pain is what’s causing pain to many Muslim women these days; the “Islam in danger” cry raised by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). Just about every Muslim religious body and Muslim leaders across the political spectrum — left parties excluded — have joined the chorus. Be ready to sacrifice your life to save the Shariah, Muslims are being enjoined inside mosques and in Muslim mohallas across the country. Anyone opposing the countrywide signature campaign launched by the Board to resist any “interference” in Muslim personal law is projected as an “enemy of Islam”.
In the belief that they’re defending “Allah’s law”, Muslim men and women are signing up. “They’re even collecting signatures from young children,” report Muslim women activists. Some Muslims who know their Islam better are refusing to sign, publicly asserting that triple talaq, halala marriage and polygamy must be banned. Tahera Apa is one of them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
No maulvi has it in him to cow down Tahera Apa. So they conceive a devious scheme. They’ve been working on her son, brainwashing him into believing his mother is anti-Islam. In consequence, son, mother and the rest of the family have spent several sleepless nights. “Kal ko aapki Islam mukhalif mahila mandal masjid tudwane ki bhee baat karegi. Aap chodo yeh kaam.” (“Tomorrow your anti-Islam mahila mandal will even talk of demolishing mosques. You leave this work)”, the anguished son has been arguing with his mother. There is no way Tahera Apa will give up her activism. But a threat her son hurls torments her, “If you don’t leave the mahila mandal, I’ll immolate myself with my children.” What if, in some dark moment, he acted on his threat?
What comes to the rescue is a little pocket book, a compilation of verses from the Quran on gender relations. Reading them gives the son an idea of Islam that is very different from what the ulema have been telling Muslims. It cools him down, for now at least.
Tahera Apa is not the only Muslim woman facing the heat for demanding that the “inhuman, unjust, anti-women and un-Islamic” Muslim personal law in India be reformed, as it’s been in over 20 Muslim-majority countries. Burqa-clad Zeenat Apa, from another basti in Mumbai, seethes as she narrates what Abu Asim Azmi, the Samajwadi Party MLA, reportedly said at a public meeting, “Agar chaar shadiyaan nahi karenge to kya hamari bewa auraton ko kothe pe bithayenge?” (If we’re prohibited from marrying four women, should we send our widows to brothels?). Azmi later “clarified” that he was only talking of women from his family, not Muslim women in general.
A few days later, Muslim women from Zeenat Apa’s basti who were running a counter-signature campaign supporting reforms were jostled and abused by a group of men. “Since then, even women who want triple talaq, halala and polygamy to go have been bullied into signing in the Board’s support,” she says.

A woman alleged that her husband has sent an SMS with ‘triple talaq’ to divorce her after her family refused to give dowry, police said today. Mumbai-based Ibrahim Khan sent the message with ‘triple talaq’ to his wife Afrin on March 27, after her family members refused to give him Rs two lakh as dowry, they said.
Afrin, who got married to Khan four years ago, was living with her parents for the last six months in Udaypur Bhooda village here, police said.

A passionate debate is on over the Centre’s stand to oppose “triple talaq” with some women politicians seeking its abolition, even as Muslim bodies accused the ruling dispensation of waging a “war” on their personal law.
The controversy arose after the Law Commission sought feedback from the public on whether the practice of “triple talaq” should be abolished and whether a uniform civil code be made optional.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) at its meeting here yesterday had asserted that Muslims have a “constitutional” right to follow their personal law of which ‘triple talaq’ was a part."

Claiming the triple talaq issue has the potential to escalate and cause eventual de- recognition of Muslim Personal Law and imposition of uniform civil code, the Chairman of State Minorities Commission that serves Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has urged the AIMPLB to change its stance on it.
The Muslim community on Sunday has a huge social problem where literally lakhs of women all over the country are suffering because their men divorced them by pronouncing talaq thrice, Abid Rasool Khan said.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Khan told reporters that he has written letters to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Jamiat-Ulema-I- Hind expressing his views, noting that during his tenure in the last more than three years, he has come across many cases of Muslim women approaching the Commission seeking justice in matters of harassment, desertion, physical abuse, non-payment of maintenance and not granting talaq or Qula, among others.
“I would like to alert you that if you (AIMPLB) insist on the triple talaq, you will be committing injustice to literally lakhs of our sisters and opening the doors for the Supreme Court to strike down this law as it is seen as being in violation of human rights,” he said.
“… This (triple talaq) has become an issue which has the potential to escalate and cause the eventual derecognition of our personal law and the imposition of a uniform civil code,” he said.
Noting that India is a secular country, Khan said though religious laws are recognised, where they were found to be in violation of human rights, they were struck down by courts.
“A case in point is the ‘Sati’ (Prevention Act, 1987) and the latest Bombay High Court judgement in the Haji Ali Dargah case,” Khan said.
“It is possible that a similar action may be taken in the case of triple divorce. If that happens, then the AIMPLB would have been instrumental in opening the door for the eventual imposition of the uniform civil code,” he said.
Triple talaq has resulted in a large number of Muslim women being abandoned by their husbands who divorced them in a fit of anger or because of their ignorance about the way to divorce a woman, Khan said.
“Added to this is the taboo of marrying a divorced woman. That is again un-Islamic, which results in young girls being condemned to live their lives as widows unable to get married again,” he said.
Khan said in the letters that Islam intends to make marriage easy and divorce difficult so that there may be time for reconciliation and the marriage may be saved.
“Unfortunately, in this country, the Muslims have turned their own law upside down and have made marriage extremely difficult and expensive and loaded all the expenses on the bride and her family which is not the way of Islam at all,” he said.

“And Muslim men are misusing the talaq and instead of following ‘Sunnah’, are following a ‘Bida’ and committing a sin and divorcing their wives without giving themselves a chance at reconciliation which Islam intends,” Khan said.
The Centre indicated last week that it is likely to take a tough stance against triple talaq in the Supreme Court on the plea that according sanctity to it under Sharia is “completely misplaced” and it is “unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory” as many Islamic countries have regulated matrimonial laws.
The Centre is also of the view that the issue is not to be seen from the point of view of uniform civil code, but be treated substantively as an issue of gender justice and that of fundamental rights of women.
These views are likely to be articulated by the Centre before the Supreme Court in the triple talaq case that will come up before it sometime this week."

TARGETING CHIEF Minister Akhilesh Yadav, AIMIM president and MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday said Muslims will give ‘triple talaq’ to Samajwadi Party for making false promises regarding the upliftment of the community. Addressing a gathering at Agra’s Kothi Meena Bazar ground, Owaisi also targeted Akhilesh for removing his father Mulayam Singh Yadav from the post of party national president. Owaisi further took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, which “has ruined the lives of lakhs of labourers and poor”.
Watch what else is making news:

Urging Muslims not to bear the burden of secularism, Owaisi asked them to vote for “their own party”, which is contesting UP polls just to provide the community an option, as it was earlier forced to go with SP, BSP and Congress to defeat BJP. Owaisi, who reached at the venue almost five hours late, spoke for almost 40 minutes. While he focussed on Akhilesh and called the PM a “dictator”, he avoided mentioning BSP chief Mayawati.
On Congress, he said: “It is already finished in India after Muslims divorced it.” “I haven’t said anything about triple talaq … But I know just one kind of triple talaq — the first that Mulims has given to Congress, which has been on ventilator since then; the second divorce we have given to BJP and the third talaq Muslims will give to SP, which should not return into power by any chance,” said Owaisi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Musalmaan ab secularism ka bojh nahi dhoyega. Ab hum secularism ke naam pe bheekh maangne walo ko apna vote nahi denge. Ab tak SP, BSP aur Congress ne BJP se darakar humare voto ko loota. Abki baar aapki apni party hai. AIMIM ke umeedwaar ko jitakar apne aap ko mazboot karo kyunki mera umeedwaar tumhari awaaz ko buland klarega. (Muslims are not going to carry the burden of secularism anymore. Now, we will not vote for people who beg in the name of secularism. The SP, BSP and Congress have looted our votes so far by scaring us of BJP. This time you have your own party. Strengthen yourself by ensuring AIMIM candidate’s victory since my candidate is going to amplify your voice).’’
Claiming that Akhilesh has failed to provide proper healthcare facilities in UP, Owaisi said: “While the CM called doctors from London to treat dying lions (at Lion Safari park), there were no doctors for infants and children who died of malaria in UP.” He went on to target Akhilesh on SP’s poll manifesto, saying that while the party had promised jobs and reservations to Muslims, “poor law and order” condition under SP had led to riots in UP, including in Muzaffarnagar in 2013.
“Arey Akhilesh apne baap ki zabaan ka hi khyaal kar lete… Netaji ki photo to laptop se nahi nikaal sakte… magar Netaji ko party se hi nikaal diya (Akhilesh, you should at least have taken care of your father’s word… you cannot remove Netaji’s photograph from laptops but you have thrown him out of the party),’’ he said while referring to Mulayam’s photograph, which is inbuilt in all laptops that had been distributed by Akhilesh to students. Claiming that only AIMIM has put up candidates with fair background, Owaisi took a dig at the BJP government at the Centre for honouring its veteran leader Murli Manohar Joshi with Padma Vibhushan.
“These guys have announced such prestigious award for Murli Manohar Joshi, who has a criminal case lodged against him in connection to Babri Mosque demolition. Is there no better person in India who deserved this award? Owaisi asked. Meanwhile, Owaisi’s partymen alleged that only received permission for the rally a few hours before the event began. The Agra administration had earlier denied permission to the AIMIM chief in 2015 and 2016."

Anil Sharma
Non-NDA parties on Monday spoke of the need to work out a common strategy for a larger opposition grouping in order to take on the resurgent BJP, and treat the upcoming presidential elections as the “acid test” for this unity. The parties were here to observe the birth anniversary of socialist icon Madhu Limaye as the “unity of progressive forces”. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh, CPI’s D Raja and Atul Kumar Anjan, NCP’s D P Tripathi, JD(U)’s Sharad Yadav, JD(S)’s Danish Ali, Raghu Thakur (LSP) and historian Irfan Habib were among those present on the occasion.
Yechury said the first test of this unity would be the presidential elections. He said that everyone knows the country runs through a Cabinet system, but “the question is what supervision is there in the President House (and) whether that supervision will be secular supervision or communal supervision”. On the issue of a grand alliance of the opposition for 2019, Yechury sounded cautious. He said that “politics is not governed by mathematics” and that the “challenge today is of ideology and principles”. His remarks came days after a number of opposition leaders, Yechury included, met Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss these issues.
Yechury also called for “narrowing the distance” between communist and socialist forces. He said the CPM believed that “class struggle in India is now standing on two feet —- one foot is economic exploitation and the other is social exploitation. As long as there is no united struggle against both, the economic as well as caste exploitation, man will not be able to walk.” Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his assertions on triple talaq, Yechury said, “What will you do to those who desert their wife without giving triple talaq?”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While a number of speakers made a strong pitch for a grand alliance against the BJP in the 2019 General Election, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh sounded a word of caution. He recalled that opposition parties had come together in a similar manner against Indira Gandhi in 1971, but Indira demolished them all by telling the masses that while she wanted to remove poverty, they all had a common goal of ‘Indira hatao’.
“If this grand alliance is not formed in a proper manner, then it will be Modi versus the others. This fight is not personality-based. It has to ideology-based,” he said. Limaye’s son Aniruddha Limaye said that while an image of a “messiah” had been created around Modi, the image of other leaders had become somewhat sullied. “If you want to fight the regressive and fascist policies of this government, you will have to make an organisation and go for agitations. Look at how many organisations the RSS has created,” he said.
Sharad Yadav said, “We will unite and save the nation.” He attacked the government over its foreign and domestic policies including Kashmir where, he said, the situation has reached a critical stage. CPI’s Atul Kumar Anjan flagged the need for comprehensive opposition unity. “JD(U), CPI and CPM may have differences with the Congress. But the challenge is bigger,” he said.
BSP leader Sudheendra Bhadoria stressed on unity of thought and action. Justice Rajinder Sachar spoke of eschewing the difference “between words and deeds”, echoing the sentiments of a number of speakers who rued the political “fighting among the secular block itself”. While opposition leaders said that Limaye did not share his colleague Ram Manohar Lohia’s pitch for anti-Congressism, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan in a press statement said that the socialist icon was his ideal and a source of inspiration “who opposed the Congress throughout his life.”"

Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday asked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to make clear her stance on triple talaq.
“It is interesting, since I am addressing you in a state which is headed by a female chief minister, and when we talk about justice for all, I would love to hear what Mamata di has to say about triple talaq,” Irani said while address mediapersons at the state BJP headquarters.
The Union minister was in the city on Wednesday to attend a party workers’ meeting in the Kolkata North Parliamentary constituency.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked to comment on the BJP’s recent performance in the Kanthi Dakshin bypoll, in which the party emerged second, Irani said the result indicated the declining popularity of Trinamool Congress and other political parties in West Bengal.
“I think it is indicative of votes converging in the hope of development by the people of Bengal. It is indicative of efforts put in by BJP’s Bengal unit. It is also indicative of future elections where BJP is headed and also of the declining popularity of TMC and other political parties in West Bengal,” she said.
When asked to comment on the CBI filing FIR against 12 TMC leaders in Narada sting case, Irani refused to do so.
“As a Cabinet minister, I cannot talk about an ongoing investigation, and it would be improper to do so. I will say that the court and the investigation agency will ensure that justice is done,” she said.
However, she criticised Mamata for placing blame on BJP for the CBI probe into the Narada sting case.
“There is a proverb in Hindi, ‘ulta chor kotowal ko dante’ (the guilty scolds the innocent),” Irani added.
The Union minister also brushed aside allegations of a ‘Modi bhai-didi bhai’ understanding and said it was a conspiracy theory by the Opposition to stay relevant in politics.
“If that was the case, our state BJP president Dilip Ghosh would not have been booked in cases. BJP workers are beaten mercilessly here and other workers are being threatened. Do you think these incidents are indicative of any understanding?” she asked.
Slamming the Opposition for making such allegations, she said: “There is a little disquiet among those political organisations that have actually faded away, and the only way they can cling onto headlines is by indulging in such conspiracy theories.”"

Shayara Banu had convinced herself that if she was docile enough, her husband would not carry out his oft-repeated threat of divorcing her. The mother of two, a sociology postgraduate, says she tried not to argue when she was told she could not work or visit relatives. Not even when she was routinely beaten, and forced to go through six abortions that made her a physical and mental wreck. Then, a year ago, when she was very sick, her husband sent her away from their home in Allahabad to her parents’ place in Uttarakhand. “Within months, he sent me a letter that had the word talaq written on it thrice, ending our 15-year marriage. I have not been allowed to see my children ever since,” Shayara says.
The 35-year-old has approached the Supreme Court seeking not just justice for herself, but a ban on triple talaq, polygamy and halala, the custom that mandates that if a woman wants to go back to her husband following divorce, she must first consummate her marriage with another man. While Muslim women have time and again taken legal recourse to seek maintenance, including in the historic Shah Bano case of 1985, Shayara’s is the first attempt at raising wider, more fundamental questions around such practices.
In the wake of the petition, the Supreme Court has forced the government to dust off a year-old comprehensive report by a high-level expert committee, whose recommendation to ban triple talaq and polygamy has not been acted upon so far.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Standing against Sharaya’s petition seeking enforcement of her fundamental right to equality and protection of life and liberty is the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which views such reforms as an infringement by the state on its fundamental right to religion. On Sharaya’s side are a few Muslim scholars and women’s organisations who hold that in Islam, a man’s right to three utterances of talaq holds only if spread over a period of 90 days, and after several attempts at reconciliation have failed.
A Muslim woman’s right to seek divorce (known as khula) has been codified under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, which requires them to approach the courts for initiating the process. On much else, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, states that the shariat will govern Indian Muslims — without specifying what these laws actually are. This has created the scope for convenient patriarchal interpretations, whereby talaq is pronounced unilaterally and instantaneously and at times, even impersonally through SMSes, emails or over the phone.
A 2015 survey of 4,710 women spread across 10 states by the autonomous national coalition, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), found that over 90 per cent wanted an end to polygamy and triple talaq. Of the 525 divorced women among the respondents, 78 per cent had been given triple talaq; 76 of these women had had to consummate a second marriage so that they could go back to their former husbands.
On polygamy, the last available data from the census of 1961 shows the incidence among Muslims to be lower than among Adivasis, Buddhists and even Hindus. BMMA co-founder Zakia Soman, however, says that there is often a link between the high rate of triple talaq and polygamous marriages that Muslim men keep under wraps.
Most Muslim countries including Pakistan and Bangladesh have outlawed such exploitative practices. Tahir Mahmood, an internationally acclaimed author of several books on Sharia law and a former Minorities panel chairperson, points out that in India, orthodox community leaders hold triple talaq to be effective once uttered, as they consider it bad in theology but good in law. He attributes the practice to the upholding, by the Caliph Omar in the 7th century AD, of a few stray utterances by men — only because their wives no longer wanted to be with them.
“Irrespective of the government in power, the only choice given to Muslims in India is either maintaining status quo or going for a Uniform Civil Code,” said Mahmood, who has been vocal in his demand for doing away with the AIMPLB, a body that comprises just 12 per cent women. Mahmood terms “over-sensitivity” by successive governments as the “minority syndrome” that is evident in Pakistan and Bangladesh too, where Muslim laws have undergone several changes, but laws governing the Hindu minority have remained largely untouched.
The issue of a Uniform Civil Code, as envisioned in Article 44, is likely to remain contentious. It raises fears of a majoritarian Hindu jurisprudence; besides, such a code requires a willingness to purge Hindu personal law of its own anti-women dogmas in marriage, inheritance and guardianship laws, and to give up the tax benefits enjoyed by the Hindu Undivided Family.
The high level expert panel noted in its report: “The approach should not be one of ensuring that there is one law for all, but rather, that all women, whether they choose to be governed by secular laws or their personal laws, enjoy equality which the Indian Constitution promises them.”"

The top Muslim body will also hold an open session to ascertain the views of the community members on triple talaq and ways to check its misuse. Widespread social evil of dowry will also be discussed.
To spread awareness among the Muslim women on their rights,mehar (gift by the husband to wife at the time of marriage),a womans share in parental property,triple talaq and dowry will top our agenda during the meeting, said Maulana Khalid Rashid,a member of the Board and general secretary of the organising committee for the three-day meet. The board will also discuss the model nikahnama, he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Admitting that the concept of tripe talaq is being misused,Rashid said: Triple talaq in a fit of rage or for any other reason has no basis in the Shariat law. If there is discord between husband and the wife,efforts for reconciliation must be made by parents,elders and the society. If these fail,the couple can approach the Darul Kaza (Shariat court) and they should accept the judgment given by the Mufti.

Vishal Srivastav
The Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), a Sangh-backed outfit, on Thursday supported the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site of Ayodhya. Speaking at an event in Lucknow, its patron and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Indresh Kumar, appealing for the temple, said Muslims never offered namaz at the site as they considered it “napaak (unclean)” and that god would not accept prayers from such a site.
He added that that the demolished Babri Masjid was named after the first Mughal ruler Babur and the naming of any religious place in the name of any human being was not acceptable. “It was the first mosque that defamed Islam. It was named after a man who was foreigner and a persecutor (atyachari),” said Kumar, also RSS national executive member. A few muslim clerics at the event also supported the construction of a temple at the site.
MRM Uttar Pradesh in-charge Islam Abbas said that the Supreme Court, which asked for the amicable resolution of the dispute, had in fact given an opportunity to the people. “Ram is centre of faith in the country,” Abbas said at the event themed “Haque ke saath aao-Ayodhya vivaad suljhao, Khush-haal Bharat banao”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Also speaking at the event, senior VHP leader Swami Chinmayananda claimed that senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi had “no intention” to pull down the Babri Masjid in 1992 and cases were lodged against both with “political” reasons.
“I know that Advani and Joshi had no intention … because a five-member high power committee was behind the campaign … and I was member of that committee. A decision to demolish the structure was never taken … It was not even discussed,” he claimed. A member of VHP Margdarshak Mandal, Chinmayananda claimed that a case was supposed to be lodged against him because he had been national convener of Ram Janmabhoomi Sangharsh Samiti. “But, it was not lodged against me. Case was lodged against Advani and Joshi. Was not politics behind it?,” said Chinmayananda.
During his speech, Indresh Kumar also called the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) unconstitutional, immoral and un-Islamic. He slammed the Board for its decision on Sunday to not abolish triple talaq.
The Board had also said Muslims who “misused” triple talaq would face “social boycott”."

The Supreme Court Friday refused to issue order granting custody of children to a Muslim woman, who has challenged the validity of triple talaq and practice of polygamy in the religion after she was divorced by her husband over a phone call from Dubai.
A bench led by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur said that the woman should approach the police and get a case registered if her children had been snatched away by the man, who allegedly granted her divorce over the phone from Dubai where he worked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“You file a police report…or go to the Calcutta High Court with a habeas corpus petition for your children’s custody. We can’t pass orders,” said the bench, as it issued notices on her main prayer questioning the validity of triple talaq.
Seeking responses from the Centre and the National Commission for Women, the bench tagged this petition with a clutch of similar petitions pending in the top court.
Appearing for the woman, advocate V K Biju, said that she has sought a declaration that Section 2 of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was unconstitutional since it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution “in so far as it seeks to recognise and validate triple talaq as a valid form of divorce”.
Biju complained that her four children were forcibly taken away from her and that she apprehended threat to the lives of three daughters and a son. But the bench said it would hear the matter only on the main prayer and that the woman should resort to other legal remedies for custody of her children.


When Biju said that the woman had gone to Jahanabad in Bihar to stop her husband marrying another woman, the bench retorted: “Why did you go to stop his marriage? Isn’t he entitled to marry four times, irrespective of the fact whether he divorced you or now?”"

Clearing the air on the controversy surrounding the Law Commission of India’s recent ‘Questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code’, Chairman Justice B S Chauhan has said the commission’s aim is not to recommend imposition of a uniform civil code but look at reform of family laws across all religions, mainly with gender justice in mind.
“We are looking at the codification and reform of all family laws. We are not looking at a uniform civil code. People have misconstrued it (the questionnaire) as one law for everyone. It doesn’t mean that everyone must follow the Hindu ritual of saptapadi (seven steps around the fire) for their marriage to be valid,” he said.
“Gender discriminatory practices such as maitri karar, nata pratha and polyandry among Hindus also need to be examined,” said Chauhan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Maitri karar allows married men in Gujarat to enter ‘friendship deeds’, allowing them to live with women other than their spouse; while nata pratha, practised in states such as Rajasthan, allows a man to sell his wife.
Chauhan, a former Supreme Court judge who has served as Chief Justice of the Odisha High court, said this was the first time the commission had elicited mass public opinion on a matter since it felt that all stakeholders must be heard. He said the commission would examine everything to ensure that personal laws in matters of marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance are in keeping with Article 15 (no discrimination based on sex, religion etc) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.
He clarified that the commission is not opposed to triple talaq as outlined in the Shariat (Muslim law) but is against the practice where the word is uttered thrice by the man immediately, ending the union. “We are not concerned with triple talaq that is done as per the Shariat over a period of a few months, allowing time for reconciliation and mediation and observation of iddat period. We are only against the practice of instantaneous and spontaneous talaq.” The validity of the latter practice, known as talaq-e-bidat, is currently being examined by the apex court while hearing the Shayara Bano petition.
Bringing in the Uniform Civil Code was part of the BJP’s election manifesto. The Law Ministry in its directive dated June 17 asked the law commission to examine the matter and submit a report. The commission issued a questionnaire seeking views on family laws of all religions on October 7, the same day the Union government filed its affidavit in the apex court supporting Shayara Bano’s plea for ban on talaq-e-bidat. This led to Muslim groups, led by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, to accuse the Modi government of waging a “war” against Muslims.
Chauhan said the timing of the questionnaire was purely coincidental and that the commission’s exercise was independent of the triple talaq matter in the Supreme Court. “We have no political agenda. Also, the SC has not asked us to give any feedback, nor are we giving any. Whatever the SC decides will be binding on us.”"

(PTI/File Photo)
Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that triple talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in Shariat amid a raging debate on the issue. He also hit out at the Congress for keeping “silence” on the matter for past several years.
“Triple Talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in Shariat. It is a matter of right of equality and right to live with dignity of Muslim women along with other women.
“Why this discrimination…this must be put to an end and it should not be politicised,” Naidu, who holds the portfolio of Information and Broadcasting, told reporters here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge charging Prime Minister Narendra Modi with politicising the triple talaq issue to gain political mileage, Naidu said, “What the PM said yesterday is that the Muslim society should think on this.”
“You (Congress) say you are champions of minorities. You don’t have concern for women among the minorities. It is a question of inequality and discrimination against the women on the basis of religion. Why you kept silent for all these years. They should answer this,” he said. To another query, he said the prime minister has already spoken against self-styled cow vigilantes.
“Some political leaders have selective amnesia and keep on speaking anything,” he said. Accusing the Opposition of pursuing an “obstructionist” agenda, the minister claimed that they are pursuing a disinformation campaign on each and every issue.
“They (Opposition parties) are not able to digest the mandate of the people. Come out with an alternative agenda. It is an obstructive and negative agenda that’s where the people are worried.”
“While India is getting connected in this way under PM Modi, some Opposition parties are not able to digest this and are indulging in a negative disinformation campaign on issues and non-issues as well,” he alleged. He said the common challenge before the people and the political class is to make a New India that can realise its true potential by which aspirations of all sections and particularly, the poor and the youth could be met.
“Our nation cannot afford negative politics. Recent election results have highlighted this message,” he said. The BJP leader appealed to all political parties to take a resolve to put an end to this “negative” politics and join constructive and positive politics so that the energies of the country and the people could be put to better use."

Neeraj Priyadarshi
One of the curiosities in this election in Uttar Pradesh, which does not seem to have a wave, and in which every moving part must be tracked specifically and separately, has to do with BSP chief Mayawati’s bid for the “Muslim vote”. The BSP gets a share of the Muslim vote in every UP election but this time, Mayawati is openly asking the community for its “ek tarafa” or one-sided vote. This time, more than in any previous election, the BSP chief has been pointed in her invitation to the community.
WATCH | Trouble For BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, Election Commission Sends Notice

At her rally here in Gorakhpur on Sunday, she reiterated her main message of a strong and firm administration that would not brook any “arajakta”, “apradh”, “danga”, (anarchy, crime, lumpenism) and put an end to “asuraksha” and “terror” (insecurity and fear). But 10 min into her nearly hour-long speech, she interrupted her more general appeal to her audience to speak directly to Muslims: “The SP is divided into camps. the Shivpal camp and the Akhilesh camp, which are trying to defeat each other’s candidates.” She insinuated BJP-SP intimacies — PM Modi, she pointed out, attended a wedding programme in Mulayam Singh’s family in Saifai. And therefore, “The Muslim vote, especially, will go waste and more than that, will benefit the BJP, if the community does not vote unitedly for the BSP, whose Dalit base is ek jut (united)”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Later in the speech, after speaking of the BJP’s “broken promises” of debt relief for farmers and jobs for the unemployed, and warning Dalits and other backward castes that the BJP would review the Constitutional policy of reservations or render it “prabhavheen” (ineffectual), Mayawati addressed Muslims again: “Muslims are being given step-motherly treatment. Attempts are being made to wrest the minority status from AMU, Jamia Millia. There is interference in Muslim personal law, triple talaq. (BJP talks of) gau raksha, love jihad, and minorities are looked at with suspicion. PM talks of of kabristans, of discrimination in providing electricity for Hindu and Muslim festivals. Yeh sarasar galat hai, PM ki shaitani hai (PM is wrong and deceitful in alleging discrimination)”.
The BSP’s strategy, in this hard-fought election, appears to rest on an appeal to three constituencies: One, its own base of Dalits — many Dalits at Mayawati’s rally admit they joined the “wave” and voted for Modi in the Lok Sabha poll, but it will only be the BSP for them again in the assembly election. Two, support from the caste group of the local BSP candidate — the BSP ticket distribution, as always, has happened silently and efficiently this time, without the petulance, rebellion and firefighting endemic to the exercise in other parties, and its list of candidates shows a carefully calculated responsiveness to the claims of the locally numerous and dominant groups.

And third, the BSP is trying to attract the support of the Muslims, the community to which it has given an unprecedented 97 tickets this time.
Indeed, in the BSP electoral project of 2017, the Muslims appear to have taken the place of the Brahmins in 2007 and 2012 — in the last two elections, the party had made a concerted bid to add that community to its “core vote”, as the “plus vote”, holding many “bhaichara sammelans” and tweaking its slogans towards that end. This time, with a resurgent BJP looking like a more natural option for the Brahmins, the BSP has shifted its focus to the minority community.
But as the last two phases of this long election in Uttar Pradesh begin, here in Gorakhpur, it would seem that the BSP’s all-out and very up-front play of the “Muslim card” may be up against a community’s hard questions, its disbelief — and its insecurity.
In the congested Mohalla Piprapur, Mohd Javed Ansari, a school teacher, says: “We are not confident of Mayawati. If she wins, she may not acknowledge our community’s contribution. She has joined hands with the BJP earlier.”
Zaheer Ahmad, who has a cloth business, suggests that Mayawati’s outreach is born of desperation: “Doobta kya na karta (she is flailing because she is drowning)” he says. “I have seen the previous Mayawati government. We have no hope from her. She has given more tickets to Muslim candidates but only to those who can win the election on their own. Otherwise, in her party organisation, from ward to nagar to district to state level, where is the Muslim hissedari (participation)?”
Hafiz Anis Ahmad, cloth shop owner and SP supporter who has fought and lost local body elections, points to the larger political climate in Gorakhpur in which the community must make its electoral choice. “In his meetings, Yogi Adityanath has been saying that if the BJP wins they will build a Ram mandir and that if the BSP or SP wins, only slaughterhouses and kabristans will be constructed.” In this situation, he says, “Yogiji se bhidna hai toh SP hi aati hai, BSP nahi (If we have to fight Yogiji, it is the SP that comes to our aid, not BSP)”.
Gorakhpur is a unique setting for Muslims in UP. Here, Yogi Adityanath, five-term BJP MP, and his private army, the Hindu Yuva Vahini, ensure what could be termed as a state of permanent religious polarisation. Here, the slogan is “Gorakhpur mein rahna hai to Yogi Yogi kehna hai”. The question, when elections come around, is about the extent to which caste will chip away at religion.
But this time, Gorakhpur’s Yogi is seen to be owned by his party much more than ever before. In this election, Adityanath has hectically roamed the state, addressing more than 150 rallies and public meetings so far, several times more than in previous elections, with the same message. “I have been travelling by helicopter. I saw broken roads, empty hospitals, but most of all, I saw the boundary wall of the kabristan. BSP-SP have done kabristan ka vikas (development of graveyards). We will bring development. And Azam Khan jaise majnuon ke liye anti-Romeo squad kaam karega (there will be anti-Romeo squads to deal with those like Azam Khan)”, he says at a small meeting late Monday evening at the city’s Ali Nagar Chauraha – renamed by Yogi’s men as “Arya” Nagar Chauraha, just as they refer to the city’s “Urdu Bazaar” as the “Hindi Bazaar”.
If the SP’s image of being a “ladaku” (aggressive) party could be working in its favour vis a vis a minority that is kept on the edge by those like Adityanath, the BSP is seen by many in the community as a Dalit party that rarely agitates on the street, and only works up a fury on personal insults to its supreme leaders, Mayawati or founder Kanshi Ram.
Asked about what has provoked the BSP to take to public demonstrations in the last few years, Gangaram Gautam, zilla prabhari, Lucknow mandal, BSP, who says that his party does take to the street, but only “Behenji ke aadesh par (at Mayawati’s command)”, recounts: “When her statue was vandalised in Lucknow by SP goons. When BJP leader Dayashankar insulted Mayawati. When a wall at the Ambedkar memorial was broken in Lucknow. When the Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar Park in Lucknow was renamed to Jnaneshwar Mishra park”. “We are not a “jhagdalu” (cantankerous) party”, says Mohd Khalid Niyaz Ansari, local businessman who is the BSP’s Vidhan Sabha Adhyaksh, Gorakhpur (grameen), somewhat defensively. “We don’t get into local pachde (brawls)”. The BSP has a “silent vote” among the Muslims, he claims.
By all accounts, the BSP, formed to give a platform and voice to one disprivileged community, the Dalits, may not yet be seen to be as responsive to the special needs and concerns of another disadvantaged group, the Muslims. In retrospect, its creation of a coalition of extremes in the previous election by targeting the historically dominant caste group of Brahmins, may have been a task less complicated and challenging than its attempt now to cobble an alliance of the oppressed by bringing together Muslims with Dalits.
At Rasoolpur chauraha, a stone’s throw from the Gorakhnath mandir, Nadeem Ahmad, imam of the local masjid, speaks in support of the BSP, as have many Muslim religious leaders and organisations in this election: “In Mayawati’s regime, prashasan tight rehta hai (the administration is firmer). At least, we will be secure in BSP rule.”
But he is immediately countered by others in the group. “Our religious leaders can say anything, go to any party”, says Tufail Ahmed, a weaver, now unemployed. “It is true that the administration is better under Mayawati, but we have no other benefit in her regime”. For Tufail Ahmed, the choice for SP is also born of a lack of choice (“hamaari majboori hai”). “It is just that the SP is unafraid to take our name, and they give us a little, just enough crumbs to keep us by their side”, he says."

Jo akaran, bewajah, aur manmane tareeke se jab chaha talaq de diya… Koi apni havas ko pura karne ke liye lagatar patniyan badalte rehne ka kaam kare… apne hi bachchon ko, apni hi patni ko sadak par bheekh maangne ke liye majboor kar de… To swabhavik roop se isse na aap achcha kahenge, na koi doosra achcha kahega),” he said.
(“The BJP is with Muslim women. Those who give talaq without any reason, at their will… They continuously change wives to satisfy their lust… forcing their own wives and children to beg on the road… Nobody will call this right.”)
Maurya was speaking to mediapersons while attending a function at the residence of a BJP worker in Basti district on Friday evening.  “Is prakar ki jo peedit mahilayen hain, bhuktbhogi mahilayen hain… BJP unko samman dilane ke liye kaam karegi (BJP will work to restore the honour of women who are victims of such practices),” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Demanding an apology from Maurya, Muslim cleric Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahli said: “Such irresponsible and uncivilised statements are not expected from a cabinet minister. He should apologise for his unparliamentary language. He has attacked the community. Census 2011 data shows that the percentage of people who marry more than once is more in other communities.”
Asked about Maurya’s remarks, Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said, “He is a senior leader and his sentiments expressing concern for women are good. But the selection of words should be appropriate, so that opposition parties and pseudo-seculars do not get any opportunity.” He said the BJP has made its stand against triple talaq clear.
Ahead of the state assembly elections, the BJP, in its election manifesto, had said it would collect the opinion of Muslim women and present it in the Supreme Court. The state government has already started holding meetings with NGOs to discuss the possible mechanism for this."

Triple talaq is a “pernicious social practice” that has been “banned or restricted” in many Islamic countries, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad Sundayday said and demanded that the Congress, SP and BSP clarify their stand on the issue. “There has been a lot of controversy over the stand of the BJP and the Narendra Modi government on the triple talaq issue. Let me point out that the debate was not initiated by us.
“A large number of women belonging to the minority community had moved the Supreme Court in protest against the practice. We have supported their cause,” he said. The Union Minister for Law and Justice said that in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Union government, it was underscored that triple talaq was an issue relating to women’s right to gender justice, dignity and equality.
“We had also submitted that the right to freedom of religion granted by the Constitution does not mean allowing a pernicious social practice,” he said. “The practice of untouchability is ultra vires the Constitution. A Hindu holding a religious function can not insist on following the inhuman practice in the name of old-age traditions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Muslim women feel that they are victims of this retrograde practice and they have the right to remedy,” he added. The Union minister found it strange that there has been a brouhaha in the country over Muslim women’s legitimate demand to put an end to “such an evil social practice”.
“Do our detractors realise that triple talaq has been banned or restricted in at least 20 Islamic countries, including the extremely conservative ones like Pakistan and Afghanistan,” he asked.
“At a time when assembly elections are underway in UP, which has a large Muslim population, we would demand that leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati come clean on the issue. They must tell the people what stand do the Congress, SP and BSP have over this matter,” the senior BJP leader said."

It is not surprising,therefore,that the recent fatwa legitimising divorce in jest was not greeted with the criticism it deserved although it victimised an innocent woman whose Qatari husband not only committed the indiscretion of typing the dreaded word talaq thrice during an Internet chat but was also foolish enough to seek a fatwa on the consequences of his naiveness.
The Deoband muftis promptly obliged him by terminating the marriage on the grounds that the marital relationship gets severed once talaq is uttered thrice,even over a mobile phone (as per a fresh fatwa) and when the wife is unable to hear it due to network problems! It may be recalled that last year Deoband issued a similar fatwa validating triple talaq given by a drunken man.
Undoubtedly,these rulings are a gross violation of Islam and it is time the Quranic procedure of divorce is highlighted.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Four steps before the first talaq (Quran,4: 34-35): As a first step,when there is marital discord,the Quran advises the husband to gently talk it out (faizuhunna) with his wife. If differences persist,the parties are asked to sexually distance themselves (wahjuruhunna) from each other in the hope that temporary physical separation may encourage them to unite. And even if this fails to break the deadlock,the husband is instructed,as a third step,to once again explain (wazribuhunna) to his wife the seriousness of the situation and try to bring about a reconciliation.
For instance,in pursuance of wazribuhunna,the husband may point out to his wife that if they do not resolve their differences soon enough,their dispute could go beyond the confines of their house and become a subject of gossip,which may not be in the interest of both parties. This would be true,because,if the dispute still remains unresolved,as a fourth step,the Quran requires the matter to be placed before two arbiters,one from the family of each spouse,for resolution.
Three talaqs: It is only after the failure of the aforementioned four attempts at reconciliation that the Quran allows the first talaq to be pronounced,followed by a waiting period called the iddat. Not more than two divorces can be pronounced within this period,the duration of which is three monthly courses [2:228-229. For women who have passed the age of menstruation the period of iddat is three months,and in the case of pregnant women it is till the termination of pregnancy [65:4.
And if the parties are unable to unite during the period of iddat as envisaged by verse 2:228,the final irrevocable talaq can be pronounced,but only after the expiry of the iddat [2:231. Once the final talaq has been invoked the marital bond is severed and the parties cease to be of any relation to each other. However,even after the period of iddat has lapsed,the Quran offers the contending parties a chance to reunite,provided the final talaq has not been pronounced [2:232. In other words,after the expiry of iddat,as per verses 2:231 and 232,the parties are given the options of remarriage or permanent separation  the separation being the third and final irrevocable talaq to be pronounced in the presence of two witnesses [65:2.
However,to emphasise the sanctity of marriage and the enormity of breaking it for frivolous reasons,the Quran warns that once the parties choose to separate after the expiry of the iddat,they cannot entertain hopes of marrying again unless the wife takes another husband and the second husband divorces her [2:230. It is understood here that a divorce may result only if the new husband has serious differences with his wife,and in the rare event of such differences cropping up,he is required to follow the procedure of divorce as discussed earlier. The extreme unlikelihood of this happening serves as a severe deterrent against arbitrary divorce.
Unfortunately,this Quranic injunction has been circumvented by sectarian seminaries to overcome the impracticality of triple talaq law of the medievalist Hanafi school. To help the victims of this law a pliable person is set up to marry the triple-divorced wife,consummate the marriage overnight and divorce her the next day so that the original husband can remarry her in accordance with 2:230. This outrageousness which an innocent woman is subjected to is known as halaala.
The abhorrent practice continues only because Muslim women are reluctant to show dissent and have allowed themselves to be indoctrinated into prioritising comparatively smaller problems such as the ban on the burqa. If the present-day shariah is to be reformed and brought into conformity with the original teachings of the Quran and the Prophet,Muslims must come out and intellectually challenge patriarchal interpretations of Islam.

As the triple talaq matter being heard in the Supreme Court picks up momentum, with the Centre filing an affidavit calling for it to be struck down on the grounds of gender justice, there is disquiet among members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and significant sections of the Muslim community.

The general secretary of the Ahle Hadees, Maulana Asghar Ali Imam Mehdi, in a rare interview, told The Indian Express: “We oppose the idea of triple talaq. This is not in keeping with the Quran and hadees (practice/sayings connected with the Prophet). We treat talaq said thrice in one go as one utterance only and taking full cognizance of how the Quran frowns upon divorce and advocates measured and patient attempts at reconciliation and the presence of proper ‘panches’ or wise counsel givers in the process, we are opposed to this form of talaq.”
Interestingly, this view held by some schools of Islamic law on triple talaq does not find mention in the affidavit of the Law Board. The affidavit sidesteps those sections within who are at odds with the practice with the emphasis being on non-interference with personal law.
Maulana Mehdi, though, is categorical in his view that “the Centre and the Courts should not interfere in personal matters of religion.” He reflects a growing unease in the community that the triple talaq issue may be used as a lever by the NDA government to open a Pandora’s box around broader questions of personal laws of minorities and eventually religious freedom itself.

“It is a right under our Constitution to practise our own respective religion,” Mehdi said. “We are uneasy with the way the Centre’s argument is framed, to make it a contest between Islam and the Constitution, where Islam is made out to be out of line with ideas of equality and gender justice. This is wrong… Islam is not anti-women, Islam also allows Khula (where the woman is free to seek divorce).” Maulana Mehdi, though, pedals back from any criticism of the Board and says he is of the view that “at a time like this, as the Personal Law Board represents all of us, no attempt must be made to break ranks.”
The chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Syed Jalaluddin Umari, echoed this. Underlining that all major Muslim organisations and a vast majority of the Muslim community stand solidly behind the Board, Umri said: “The problem of triple talaq and polygamy has been blown out of proportion with the sole motive of portraying Muslims as being patriarchal and misogynistic. The percentage of polygamy amongst Muslims is negligible. It is not mandatory for Muslims to practice polygamy but permission to have more than one wife does exist, albeit under certain conditions’’.

As the Ahle Hadees, some other sections, including Shias, also denounce triple talaq, uttered simultaneously, as un-Islamic. However, they are at a loss to explain why a call to rid the community of this malpractice — in sections it is prevalent in — was not taken up as a campaign earlier and was left to petitions filed either by harassed women or NGOs or associations backed by political groups that wanted to frame the debate in terms of Islam versus women’s rights.
One petition filed by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan says the Uniform Civil Code is not pertinent to the debate but has a prayer that the triple talaq is un-Islamic and that should be sufficient grounds to strike it down.
Last week, stating that absence of reforms in the community in the last 65 years have left Muslim women “extremely vulnerable — both socially as well as financially”, the Centre, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court, said that polygamy and triple talaq “cannot be regarded as essential or integral part of the religion”.
The affidavit, submitted by the Union Law Ministry in response to a clutch of petitions challenging polygamy and triple talaq, said that the validity of these practices required a “reconsideration” by the top court “in light of the principle of gender justice and overriding principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality” as well as “evolution of women”."
"1617717060-43","https://indianexpress.com/page/122/?s=Triple+talaq","Divorce, divorce, divorce","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/divorce-divorce-divorce/","Divorce, divorce, divorce","November 19, 2004","Inspite of controversy, there is still no consensus on the issue of triple talaq. Muslim women are being arbitrarily divorced by husbands in various ways  while the Muslim Personal Law Board is tight-lipped on the subject.
It is necessary to understand the Quranic position in relation to divorce. Talaq or divorce is strongly condemned by Islam.Prophet Muhammad, if not prohibiting divorce altogether, was desirous of imposing curbs on its unfettered use as permitted by pre-Islamic practice. Besides restricting the husband’s power of divorce, he went so far as to forbid its exercise without the intervention of the arbiters or judges (Hakams) (4:35). He denounced Talaq as the most detestable of all things permitted. 
A Muslim is required to face the problems of marital life; divorce is only  a last and final resort. The Quran illustrates this point by expressing approval when the Prophet insisted that Zayd should not divorce his wife Zaynab inspite of the fact that there was a long standing dissension between the husband and wife. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Quran characterizes disagreement between a husband and wife that is serious enough to raise a threat of divorce as Shiqaq (Breach). But not even Shiqaq  entitles either husband or wife to a divorce per se as the Quran sets out certain procedures such as the appointment of conciliators or arbitrators. In the Quran the concept of divorce is described thus: ‘‘If ye fearShiqaq (Breach) between then twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, God will cause their reconciliation. ’’ (4:35).
Regarding Talak-i-bidat or triple Talaq it is important to understand that the word ‘‘bidat’’ itself means disapproved or innovative or something the Prophet never did or recommended. It is therefore known to be an irregular or heretical form of divorce. Although disapproved by the Prophet, it has been accepted by most of the Sunni jurists though they submit that in ‘‘commissioning it the man incurs a sin.’’ The Shias and Malikis and Ahl al Hadith do not accept the validity of such a form or divorce.
The most common method of talaq-i-bidat is triple pronouncement brought about in a single sitting.Talaq-i-bidat in India is also effective if the husband were to repudiate his wife during her menstrual flow; in jest at the slip of tongue, under intoxication, or also, if he were to accompany a single repudiation with some expression of finality.
In this form of talaq after the ronouncement, if the parties wish to remarry they can not do so till the wife undergoes halala (a pre-Islamic custom) or the wife goes through another marriage which is consummated and subsequently dissolved. The rights of inheritance cease immediately and the talaq becomes irrevocable, though the death, whether of the husband or the wife, may occur before the expiry of iddat or the waiting period.
This seems to have been the customary form of divorce practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia. Neither does the Quran mention this form nor was it recognized or sanctioned by the Prophet. It seems to have crept into Islamic jurisprudence at the instance of the Omeyyad monarchs.Some scholars indicate Caliph Umar legitimised this form of divorce as an emergency measure. His object in making effective three divorces pronounced on one occasion was to warn the people that they would have to take the evil consequences of following an un-Islamic practice, but the result was contrary to what he intended. Henceforth, it became a general practice to pronounce divorce thrice on a single occasion, thus turning a revocable divorce into an irrevocable one.
Innumerable jurists and theologians from the days of antiquity down to modern times have held that the pronouncement of a triple divorce is not permissible. This form of divorce has been constantly reviewed by Muslim countries all over the world and subjected to severe criticism. Preventive measures of various kinds have been adopted that have constrained its use in its present form. In all such countries arbitration councils and judicial intervention have been introduced to attempt reconciliation. Tunisia, Algeria, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt and several Muslim countries have introduced different measures to safeguard women’s rights.
The demand to bring an end to the practice of the triple talaq in India is routinely ignored by the conservatives. In doing so they not only uniformly invoke a patrichial picture of Islam but also dismiss the gender-sensitive egalitarian voice of Islam which has given equal rights to women. ‘‘And women shall have rights similar to those against them (2:229).’’. Triple talaq is an un-Quranic, un-Islamic practice.

These debates have particular poignancy for communities whose personal law is to be made “uniform” and for the political parties who promise to pilot a code. It is too emotional and volatile an issue to readily permit rational consensus. Proponents for change insist that almost seven-decades is too long a period for the state to not endeavour towards a UCC. In contrast are the claims that the time is not ripe and an establishment-centred hegemony should be avoided. A major twist has now been added to the tale by the demands of the movements for human rights of children as well as by the demands placed by women’s rights movements for laws and policies that do not discriminate on the basis of gender.
However, the constitutional promise itself is infinitely complicated. Public and political debates have not considered what exactly are the “duties” created by Article 44. So far, all interpretive efforts have eluded narrative coherence. The duty is not to merely to legislate but to “secure” a code. How long shall the state endeavour? Perhaps, the time has come for an amendment of this article and prescribing a time-bound schedule.
Has the state at all endeavoured? While there are many different standpoints, Law Commission Chair, Justice B.S. Chauhan, was right in saying that the elements of a UCC already exist in “some legislations where a common law was applicable to all without consideration of religion”, and that “most people are perhaps unaware that common code exists in many laws”. But his preliminary articulation suggesting the need to de-link the UCC from religion will surely be contested.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Perhaps by “uniform” we understand that all citizens should be subject to the same law, regardless of community, religion, and identity. But when the personal law stands anchored in the freedom to practice religion, state intervention may violate a fundamental right. Further, who decides what religion requires: The custodians or all the coreligionists? What legal and social meaning is to be invested in Article 51-A(f), which talks of the fundamental duty of all citizens “to value and preserve the rich heritage of composite culture”? When may this conflict with Article 51-A(e) that talks of the need to “renounce practices derogatory of women”? The duty (in clause “h”) to “develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of enquiry and reform” reinforces social inclusion in religion and the state. How best to have legal controls over religious practices that hurt human rights warrants serious consideration from all sides.
And indeed when is a “code” a “code”? If codification is to avoid merely articulating majoritarian might, it ought to be a historically-calibrated state venture at social consensus. Here, adjudicatory leadership matters as much as national leadership. Is piecemeal normative cleansing of disvalued difference less eligible than a total UCC? Is reasoned judicial enunciation to be preferred over “state endeavour”? The question is: How best to secure a codification that genuinely endeavours to remove discrimination and prejudice against women’s and child rights?
The German historical jurist Fredrick von Savigny said (in mid-19th century) that codification involved both a “technical element” (the knowledge of customs that are to be codified) and a “political element” (the question of political will to codify). Do we know enough about the personal law of various tribal communities from which the UCC may choose? Or, the laws of various Hindu and Muslim communities? Do we know enough about the religious personal law of other Indian communities? It is a sad mistake to think that a UCC is all about Hindu-Muslim relations and identities.
The political element in India today must refer equally to political and judicial will. True, the Supreme Court has quite often subjected customary and codified personal laws to the equality and gender justice discipline of the Constitution and also said that a UCC is a desirable constitutional mandate which the state ought to follow more expeditiously. The court (Chief Justice T. S. Thakur, Justices A.K. Sikri, and R. Banumathi) has also said that it is the solemn duty of Parliament to enact a UCC. However, in response to a PIL filed in the Supreme Court, a bench of Justices Anil R. Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel also directed the National Legal Services Authority of
India to re-examine the issue of “gender discrimination” suffered by Muslim women in the country.
The nascent Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a national coalition of Muslim women with over 70,000 members across 13 states, recently collected around 50,000 signatures of Muslim women demanding the abolition of the triple talaq system of divorce. And it has sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for reforms. Obviously, the authority is bound to take into account this petition. Besides, the Law Commission of India has been asked in June to submit a report on UCC.
It thus seems that there is a new political determination about UCC in the air. The difficult decisions ahead relate to the linkage between personal law system and religious and communitarian identity. While the UCC opponents maintain that the state may reform a community law only with their consent, it is also a moral principle that the consent should not be withheld unreasonably and permanently. The additional requirement that the state provides security and safety to every citizens is valid: A democratic state should neither become an “institutionalised riot system” (in Paul Brass’s words) nor should governance become a specialised sphere of managing “riot after riot” (to use the title of M.J. Akbar’s book).
Farrah Ahmed concludes that the existing personal law system “harms religious autonomy” (considered as self-respect) of those subject to it. However, she suggests a religious alternative dispute resolution (ADR), under which persons will devise their norms and choose religious arbitration or mediation, restrained only by legal protections against oppression. One hopes that ADR will find some resonance in state and civil society, as a prelude to a future UCC."

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Sunday said instant triple talaq — in which the husband says ‘talaq’ thrice in quick succession — is “wrong”, but is still a valid way to end a marriage.
The Board, however, also said Muslims who “misuse” instant triple talaq would face a “social boycott” from the community. It issued an eight-point code of conduct on divorces and marital disputes as it sought to counter the perception that Sharia-based Muslim personal law is prejudiced against women.
At the end of the two-day meeting of its executive committee — which was dominated by the issue of triple talaq — the AIMPLB also iterated that it would “accept the Supreme Court’s verdict alone” on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. “The title suit is pending in the Supreme Court and sooner the verdict comes the better,” AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Mohammad Wali Rahmani told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Not only was triple talaq valid, conveying it by a mobile phone message too, was valid, Rahmani said. He drew a parallel with sending an invitation card instead of inviting in person — the card is considered enough to convey the invitation for a wedding, and the host is not required to go himself, Rahmani said.
In a statement issued after the meeting at the Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama Islamic seminary in Lucknow, AIMPLB president Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadvi said Muslims have “complete constitutional right” to practise their personal law, which also put the responsibility on the community to “protect it by fully adhering to it”.
The Sharia has given equal rights to men and women, and it is the responsibility of the community to provide those rights to women, Nadvi said. There are “large-scale misconceptions” about Muslim personal law, especially the law of talaq, because of lack of “correct information”, he said.
“The correct argument is that the talaq has been kept to save the women from danger,” the statement said, adding that if a few people misuse it, what is required is not a change in the law, but the reforming of such people.
When Muslims are not allowed to force their religious beliefs on others, the traditions of other religions should also not be imposed on them, Nadvi said.
The Board’s code of conduct said the Sharia considered marriage “a permanent and stable relationship”. In the first three points, it urged Muslim couples to try to settle their differences by themselves, attempt temporary separation, and involve family members for reconciliation and arbitration.
If mediation does not work, triple talaq should be employed, but with fixed waiting periods between declaration of talaq for the first, second and third times. The husband should leave the wife after giving the first talaq, and allow the waiting period of iddat get over. If a compromise is reached during the waiting period, they should restart their relationship, the Board has said.
According to the code of conduct, if the wife is pregnant, the waiting period will continue until the pregnancy is over. The husband will have to give maintenance to his wife for the waiting period of iddat, and return the mehar (promised at the time of marriage) after the divorce is finalised.
It has also said the husband should strictly follow the waiting period and declare talaq for the first time in the first month, for the second time in the second month and for the third time in the third month in “paki (pure) condition”.
It has said that the wife too can end the marriage by using khula. The eighth point in the code of conduct states that the Muslim community should socially boycott the person who gives instant triple talaq. This social boycott, Rahmani said, would be similar to the practice of denying “hookah paani (social contact)”.
Rahmani told reporters that the Board has appealed to imams of mosques and clerics to stress on adherence to the code of conduct in their speeches at Friday prayers. He said the Board would help women who have suffered due to the “unjust use of triple talaq”.
The rate of divorce among Muslims, Rahmani said, was much lower than what is sometimes portrayed in the media. He sought to clarify the practice of halala: “The meaning of halala is that the woman is haram for the husband after talaq. She can then marry another person. And if her second husband dies or the couple gets divorced, she can return to her first husband. This is not like it’s done on purpose.”
Rahmani did not comment on the BJP governments’ support to the demand for an end to instant triple talaq. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that his government would present its “stand formed on the basis of Muslim women’s opinion” to the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions related to triple talaq. Adityanath has asked for a plan to gather the views of Muslim women, and directed ministers to meet with women’s groups.
Board member Kamal Faruqui rejected as incorrect the “propaganda” that a lot of women were affected by triple talaq. Another member, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, said Muslims had a lower rate of divorce than non-Muslims.
Asma Zahra of the AIMPLB women’s wing said the Board had collected 5.81 crore signatures — including from 2.71 crore women — from individuals who said they wanted to follow Muslim personal law and opposed uniform civil code. Muslim women have the right to remarry after divorce and after the death of their husband, she said.
Zahra said the Board is working to help women affected by instant triple talaq, and has set up a toll-free helpline. “We have received 15,500 calls on the helpline. Most of the calls are not on the issue of triple talaq but related to marital discord and family disputes. Men are also calling to seeking help to counsel their wives. The real issues for women are dowry, female infanticide and security of women,” she said."

At a public event in Meerut on Friday, controversial MP and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sakshi Maharaj added a communal tone while speaking about India’s population explosion in what many say is an indirect jibe at the Muslim community. The alleged hate speech comes just days after the Election Commission implemented the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in the poll-bound state. Uttar Pradesh votes in seven phases from February 11 to March 8.
Without directly naming anyone, Maharaj reportedly said, “This population rise is not because of the Hindus. Population has risen due to those who support the concept of four wives and 40 children.” He added, “Mothers aren’t just birth-giving machines. Mother, Hindu or Muslim, should be respected.”
The BJP leader was in the city in Uttar Pradesh to inaugurate a temple when he made the remarks. Further saying that “the time to end ‘triple talaq’ is here”, he urged the government to implement Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as soon as possible. According to CNN-News18, Maharaj defended his comments saying, “I have not commented on any community. I have been misquoted and ready to face election commission.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress leader KC Mittal told ANI, “Sakshi Maharaj’s speech based on caste and religion is very offensive. Its a violation of the MCC and the recent Supreme Court judgement” adding that the party will move EC to formally request action against the leader. The BJP however distanced itself from the MP’s remarks with union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi saying it shouldn’t be seen as a stand of the party.
Later explaining his statement, Maharaj said, “The population is rising, land is limited. I just said that women aren’t machines and that having 4 wives, 40 children and 3 divorces isn’t acceptable.” He added, “(Me and my brothers) should get an award. All four of us are celibate so there’s no question of kids.”

Maharaj, the MP from Unnao, has a history of making communally-charged statements. In January 2015, he urged all women of the Hindu community to give birth to at least four children to increase the Hindu population in the country."

So is the practice in a majority of the Muslim countries.
The NCW, in its recent report ‘‘Welfare of Muslim Women’’, has attempted to generate awareness by cataloguing progressive laws on divorce and marriage in other Muslim countries after it found that the ‘‘triple talaq’’ practice has been widely misused in India with intimations of divorce sent in even through telegrams and e-mails.
In Pakistan, oral talaq — where a husband can unilaterally end his marriage by pronouncing the word talaq thrice — was banned in 1961. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
All divorces have to be obtained through family courts after a proper legal notice to the wife and after the separation period of 90 days. Also, a man cannot remarry until he has a written consent from his first wife. Even then he would have to get approval for the second marriage from a family court or else the marriage is not legal.
The NCW says it is aiming at a nationwide circulation of the report through NGOs, the state women commissions and even Muslim organisations like the Wakf boards.
Nafisa Hussein, member, NCW, who worked on the document, told The Indian Express that Indian Muslim women were in the most disadvantageous position since neither the community leaders nor the clergy were ready to inform them of their rights. 
‘‘There is a huge social problem on the ground created by oral talaq as lakhs of women are left to fend for themselves for no fault of theirs,’’ she said. She added that ‘‘divorces are given on grounds as flimsy as the woman’s audacity to take the children to get a polio vaccination’’.
She said creating awareness about other Islamic societies would help fight the propaganda that the Shariat laws could not be interpreted or changed.
In countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, even a second marriage is banned. 
However, in countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria and Bangladesh, second marriages are discouraged through a strict legal and administrative mechanism.
Unlike in India, where Muslim women have no right to divorce, in Turkey and Iran, both husband and wife enjoy equal rights for seeking divorce. In Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh, government officials have to prove that they had gone for a divorce only after having made serious efforts to patch up their differences with their spouse. In all these Islamic countries, divorce is final only after a court verdict.
Again Turkey, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran and Bangladesh have legally banned one-sided divorces, which gave men arbitrary powers to break marriages, while countries like Egypt, Sudan, Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Pakistan and Bangladesh had banned the practice of triple talaq long ago."

Accusing BJP of indulging in communal polarisation in view of the forthcoming assembly elections in five states, CPI(M) on Saturday said the poll results in Uttar Pradesh would be a “triple talaq” to the saffron party by the people against its communal policies.
Addressing a public meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on the sidelines of the ongoing three-day Central Committee meeting of CPI(M), its General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said the BJP-led NDA had faced people’s “talaq” in earlier assembly polls in Bihar and New Delhi and urged all secular forces to come united to ensure defeat of the saffron party and its partners in Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.
Watch what else is making news:

He alleged that BJP and RSS have started raking up communal issues in Uttar Pradesh despite the recent Supreme Court judgement, which said religion cannot be used for making an appeal in elections.”As part of the communal polarisation, BJP-RSS have once again picked up the campaign for uniform civil code and triple talaq,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The worst vote bank politics in this country is played by the RSS and BJP…that’s to consolidate the communal Hindu vote bank. And that’s why they have started campaign against triple talaq,” he said.”After Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, there were assembly elections. In Delhi election, only three of you (BJP) have won out of total 70 seats. That was the government’s first talaq,” he said.
“Next came the Bihar election…the BJP president said if Modi and BJP defeated, there would be crackers burst in Pakistan. So you have to elect BJP government in Bihar. But you know what had happened. The election result was the second talaq for Modi,” he said.
Yechury said, “BJP and RSS would realise the real meaning of triple talaq when the Uttar Pradesh results come out. It is our duty, as the people of our country, for all the secular forces to unite to ensure that BJP and the communal forces will face their triple talaq in Uttar Pradesh…and that will be the real meaning of their triple talaq campaign,” he said.
Criticising the BJP National Executive’s claim on Saturday that the demonetisation had been successful in its results, Yechury said they were trying to mislead through their propaganda machinery not bringing into the fore the actual problems being faced by cores of people due to the withdrawal of high value currencies.
Yechury said, “The BJP national executive today accepted that almost all of the money demonetised has now come back to the banks. So, what does it mean? It is not black money that is being confiscated. It is black money that has been permitted to turn into white money into legal money.”
“All counterfeit money have become legal. So black money has become white and counterfeit money has become legal and that is the achievement of this, which is completely opposite of what the Prime Minister claims,” he alleged.He said the party’s Central Committee has decided to launch a movement across the country demanding immediate removal of the restriction on people to withdraw their own money from their bank accounts.
Criticising the BJP’s claim that the GDP rate of the country has not been affected despite demonetisation, he said the government was doing “a very sophisticated type of cheating. They also claimed that the demonetisation has not affected the economy”.
“They claimed that the growth rate of the country is 7.1 per cent, only slightly less than the 7.5 per cent in spite of demonetisation,” he said.
“These figures are of the period before demonetisation began…and on that basis they are claiming that GDP rate has not been affected. But if you add the next three months, then the real effect of the fall in the GDP would be known and that is what they try to conceal,” he said.
He said before Modi came to power, one per cent of “rich and shining India people” controlled 43 per cent of the country’s GDP. But today, two years later, one per cent people controls nearly 59 per cent of GDP,” he alleged.”When people’s discontent may turn into a political movement against Modi government, in all to prevent that, RSS and BJP have started a formula to divert people’s attention by sharpening communal polarisation,” Yechury said.
Veteran leaders Prakash Karat, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, V S Achutanandan and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan were also present. The three-day central committee meeting would conclude in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday."

Most of the opposition parties who have responded to the Law Commission questionnaire on the contentious uniform civil code have dubbed the move to refer the matter to it as part of the BJP government’s “political agenda” with some of them even questioning the timing ahead of Uttar Pradesh polls. Responding to the questionnaire, parties such as Congress, BSP and TMC are learnt to have refrained from saying as to whether they support to a common code or not. They have, however, dubbed the decision of the government to refer the matter to the law panel as part of its political agenda to further its political interests, sources said.

Some parties have also questioned the timing of the decision to refer the matter to the Commission ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls due early next year.
The BSP, which was perhaps the first party to respond to the law panel, has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly imposing the agenda of the RSS on the people.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Responding to the law panel’s request to answer the questionnaire, BSP said the party is attaching a press statement issued by Mayawati on October 25 in Lucknow.
Instead of answering the 16 questions put out by the law panel, the BSP said the press statement is its response to the questionnaire.
The BSP statement said the BJP has been trying to impose the agenda of the RSS on the people ever since it came to power at the Centre.
Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is learnt to have opposed a common code and has supported its stand through certain court orders.
The NCP is learnt to have opposed the practice of “instant triple talaq” but has by and large supported separate personal laws.
Highly-placed sources in the panel said the questionnaire has so far received over 40,000 responses which continue to pour in even after the expiry of the deadline.
While the deadline to send the responses ended on December 21, the law panel said it would continue to entertain responses received after the deadline.
“Uniform Civil Code is one of the important projects before the Law Commission. The responses/replies received by the Commission are being processed. The response/replies received, if any, after the date may also be considered,” it said in a brief statement.
Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional, the Law Commission had on October 7 asked the public seeking response on these sensitive issues.
The All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had slammed the questionnaire, saying it was uncalled for.
Amid a raging debate on uniform civil code, the law panel had sought public views on the subject to revise and reform family laws, saying the aim is to address social injusticeand its not against plurality of laws.
The Commission said the objective behind the endeavour is to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices even as it assured the people the “norms of no one class, group or community will dominate the tone and tenor of family law reforms”.
In an accompanying questionnaire, the Commission had asked whether the existing personal laws and customary practices need codification and whether it would benefit people.
Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished, retained or retained with suitable amendments; and whether a uniform civil code should be optional are among 16 queries by the commission."

While releasing manifesto, the BJP president said the party will form government in Uttar Pradesh with a two-thirds majority.
He attacked Samajwadi Party and Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party which have ruled Uttar Pradesh for the last 15 years, accusing them of doing nothing to develop the backward state.
BJP, he said, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would turn UP into a developed state, the way it has developed the other states it rules.
“All BIMARU – Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh – states have become developed except UP,” he soid.
BJP is going hammer and tongs to return to power in UP after 15 years.
In 2012, it had won only 47 of the state’s 403 seats, but in the 2014 national election, it swept 71 of the state’s 80 Lok Sabha seats and hopes to repeat that performance in this year’s assembly election.
Elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases from February 11 to March 8."

Interpreting the Centre’s stand in the Supreme Court against the practice of triple talaq as a “conspiracy” to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Muslim organisations, led by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Thursday slammed the government for “creating discord” between communities, saying the UCC was against the very Constitution of India. Responding to the AIMPLB’s charges, leaders of the BJP maintained that the UCC and triple talaq were disparate issues and should in no way be treated as extensions of one another.

Maulana Wali Rehmani, general secretary of AIMPLB, told reporters in New Delhi: “The Constitution of India is the binding agreement that India has with every citizen of the country. Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees religious freedom — it is what keeps the country united. It is wrong, inappropriate of the government to try to govern the entire country with one stick.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It seems that the Modi government is using UCC as a ruse to divert attention from its failures of the last 30 months. It is a new war the government is waging. Sarhad to sambhal nahin rahi, andarooni jung ki taiyyari kar rahein hain (They cannot protect the borders but are preparing for internal strife),” Rehmani alleged, announcing that Muslim organisations will protest through democratic means across the country.
He said Muslims would boycott the questionnaire issued by the Law Commission on anti-women practices in all religions and the AIMPLB would instead issue its own questionnaire to “reflect the real mood” in the country on personal laws.

The Law Commission, Rehmani said, was acting as an organ of the government rather than an autonomous institution.
Representatives of different Muslim organisations and institutions, including the Jamiat Ulama i Hind and Darul Uloom Deoband, used the platform to announce countrywide protests against the UCC but refused to answer queries on the issue of triple talaq. The AIMPLB’s position, they said, had already been clarified in an affidavit in the highest court.
Rehmani claimed that census data showed there was more polygamy among Hindus than Muslims and more divorces too. He named a Jharkhand politician to make his case. “The intentions of this government are suspect. They are trying to create strife in the name of unity,” Jamiat Ulama i Hind president Arshad Madani said.
Asked about his opposition to the UCC, perceived as a tool to stop gender discrimination, Rehmani slammed the Prime Minister and went on to cite the example of United States where personal laws for religions were separate. He said this government could may as well take lessons from America.
BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya dismissed the AIMPLB accusations, saying that the Board should instead focus on the divorced Muslim women who have approached the court over triple talaq.
“We do not need any certificate from them but it is wrong to cast personal aspersions, especially when the Prime Minister’s post has its own dignity. The Board should talk to divorced Muslim women who approached the court. The court had asked for the government’s view and it was given. It is the responsibility of the government to protect the rights of all women. There is currently no work on UCC,” Vijayvargiya said.
Another BJP office-bearer said the government stand was taken on the basis of the Constitution and its commitment to gender equality. The Law Commission questionnaire, the office-bearer said, was part of an initiative to collect stakeholder feedback and the findings would be placed in the Supreme Court."

He said that for him ‘SCAM’ stood for “Service, Courage, Ability and Modesty”.
Campaign in the first of seven phased Assembly elections ended on Thursday in 73 seats of western Uttar Pradesh where Prime Minister Narendra Modi staked his all in the fight against SP-Congress alliance and BSP making it essentially a triangular contest. Urging the voters to end the ‘vikas ka vanvas’ (exile of development) and projecting demonetisation as an attack against corruption, Modi and BJP accused SP and BSP of plundering the state over the years and targeted the SP-Congress alliance, saying the two had come together to save themselves.

Joining hands with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav led the SP assault, as party patriarch Mulayam kept away following family feud, with the two scions taking on Modi over “suffering” of common man due to note ban and his “unfulfilled” promise of ‘acche din’. Akhilesh also reached out to voters on his “performance”, claiming his government had taken up development works like Metro and expressways. The seats are spread over 15 districts of western Uttar Pradesh, including riot-scarred Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. BJP leaders like Yogi Adityanath and Sangeet Som raised the issue of alleged exodus of Hindus from some areas and accused the SP government of favouring a particular community.

In the last election SP and BSP had bagged 24 seats each and BJP had 11 out of the 73. The saffron party is hoping toimprove its tally as it had bagged 71 out of 80 seats in the state in the 2014 general election, but the SP-Congress tie-up has added a new dimension to the contest. The region is also a stronghold of Rashtriya Lok Dal of Ajit Singh which had bagged nine seats while the Congress had got only five. The Muslim-dominated areas in the belt will be an acid test for BSP chief Mayawati, who is banking heavily on Dalit-Muslim vote bank. The region was once BSP’s favourite hunting ground.
In her rallies, Mayawati accused the Modi government of interfering with the personal law of Muslims and ending reservations for backward communities in jobs. She targeted Akhilesh government over the law and order situation and cautioned Muslims time and again that if they wanted to defeat BJP, they should not waste their votes by backing SP-Congress alliance.

As the campaign peaked, BJP stepped up its attack on the SP-Congress alliance terming it as a “theatre of the absurd”. Both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah hopped from one rally to another asking voters to choose between development agenda of BJP and those who give shelter to criminals, indulge in vote bank politics and encourage land and mine mafias.
Modi asked people to “rid the state of SCAM – S for Samajwadi (party), C for Congress, A for Akhilesh (Yadav) and M for Mayawati”, Irked over the acronym, Akhilesh Yadav in his rallies told the electorate that SCAM actually stood for ‘Save the Country from Amit Shah and Modi’. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi hit back at Modi saying a wrong doer sees scam in everything. He said “S infact stands for ‘service’, C for ‘courage’, A for ‘ability’ and M for ‘modesty’.”
Rahul harped on the issue of note ban and attacked Modi, saying, “Demonetisation has hurt the poor most”. The campaign saw stray incidents of violence with supporters of archrival SP and BSP clashing in Hathras district in which one person was killed and five others were injured.

In another incident, two bullet-riddled bodies, one identified as the brother of an RLD candidate, were found in a mango orchard near Khurja in Bulandshahr district. With western UP having vast agricultural land, Modi, in his speeches punctuated with wit and humour, played pro-poor and pro-farmers card and reiterated his party’s promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.
Both Modi and Shah slammed Congress and Samajwadi Party, saying Rahul ran a campaign against the SP government and wondered as to what happened overnight that they were embracing each other. Raising the issue of demonetisation, Modi told the voters that it was a fight against corruption and for the rights of the poor. “Parties are angry with me as I am tightening screws on wrong doers,” he said at a rally in Aligarh. He said the parties are afraid that if he gets a majority in Rajya Sabha he will take more such decisions.

He also attacked Akhilesh over the law and order situation, accusing the ruling party leaders of sheltering and nursing criminals. Rahul and Akhilesh claimed the “SP-Congress storm” sweeping Uttar Pradesh will “blow away” BJP and BSP and “finish” Modi who is “trying to bring Company Raj” in India. Taking potshots at the two leaders, the BJP chief said, dubbed them as “‘khoobsurat shehzade’ (good-looking princes) who are out to mislead the public”.
“Mother is fed up with one and father is fed up with the other. How will they help UP? One has looted the country, while the other has looted the state,” he said, alleging “Congress and SP have an alliance of corruption and criminalisation”. BSP, which appears to be relying on Muslim support by giving them maximum 99 tickets (out of 403), targeted the BJP, alleging it was meting out step-motherly treatment to minority community and trying to abolish ‘Triple Talaq’ system.
The districts going to polls on February 11 in the first phase are Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Agra, Firozabad, Etah and Kasganj.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which will start its three-day convention from tomorrow, said that the issues of uniform civil code and triple talaq were raised by the BJP and RSS to divert attention from their ‘failures’.
AIMPLB general secretary Maluana Wali Rehman told reporters that the Modi government had failed to deliver on their promise to uplift the Muslim community. He said that the convention would devise a strategy to counter the “ill motives” behind the move.
“The BJP-RSS is trying to infringe on the personal and fundamental rights of the Muslims,” Rehman said. The convention will end with a mass rally at Park Circus maidan on November 20.
The AIMPLB, which is the highest decision-making body on Muslim personal laws, usually sticks to only the personal laws broadly covering marriage, divorce (talaq), inheritance, succession and adoption-related issues."

At the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) two-day ‘Yuva Sant Sammelan’ which kicked off in Kanpur on Monday, young sants from across the country took a pledge to open ashrams near Dalit slums to stop religious conversions. The sants also spoke up against triple talaq and supported the Centre’s uniform civil code.
The Sammelan, which was held in Uttar Pradesh for the first time, was attended by around 175 young sants from across India except the southern states. The event, being held in Panki area of Kanpur, was inaugurated by Kamal Nayan Das Maharaj of Ayodhya.
Sources said the sants pledged to stop religious conversions, which according to them is happening due to illiteracy, greed, untouchability and fear.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Speaking to The Indian Express, VHP national secretary Ashok Tiwari said that debates and discussions on various aspects of Hinduism, ‘love jihad’, religious conversion, triple talaq, untouchability, freedom for women, skewed caste and sex ratio, national security and terrorism among others, will also be part of the two-day Sammelan.
“On the first day, the delegation of sants discussed ways to stop religious conversions. For this, the young saints will be setting up ashrams near Dalit slums and will make people aware against untouchability. We will also organise community havan and anushthan for Dalits and all those who were converted, to bring them back in their own religion, that is Hinduism,” said Tiwari.
The sants will also open schools offering basic primary education, while the ashrams will provide students with free food. “The sants will give a brief description of their areas and territories tomorrow, after which we will discuss how to proceed with our plans,” Tiwari further said."

The daily Inquilab, in its editorial on October 10, writes: “Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that ‘the jawans of the country have given their blood in Kashmir, you are hiding behind them and you are doing dalali for them’, is a regrettable example of use of the wrong words at a wrong time. With this statement, communal elements have got an opportunity for not only making noise but also for unhesitatingly cashing on the surgical strikes. Questions raised about the surgical strikes, particularly revelations that such strikes were undertaken even in the past, had put the BJP in a defensive position. It should not have got the opportunity that it got due to Rahul Gandhi’s statement.On the one side, the Prime Minister is instructing his party’s leaders and supporters not to make the surgical strikes an issue for celebration. Isn’t the contradiction between the PM’s instructions and the activities of his partymen evidence of double standards?”
Roznama Khabrein,in its editorial on October 8, writes: “The government’s ministers ignored the instructions of the PM and kept making provocative statements and the BJP has started using the surgical strikes for its political campaign. The Prime Minister should discourage all such steps that give the feeling that the sacrifices of our army are being used politically. Only then would the country speak in one voice.”
Triple talaq and beyond
Despite expression of dissatisfaction and even criticism of the affidavit filed by the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board in the Supreme Court on the issue of triple talaq in a section of the Urdu press, there is a sense of unanimity in support of the Board and for not allowing any interference in personal law by the government. Editor of Roznama Khabrein, Qasim Syed in a signed front page commentary on October 9, writes: “Following the country’s independence, the greatest challenge to the protection of the Muslim Personal Law Board is before us. Some weaknesses and shortcomings in the Board’s affidavit can be of benefit to its opponents. Some senior members of the Board and active leaders of different religious organisations had, in a letter to the Board’s president, Maulana Rabey Hasani, expressed their apprehensions on this score.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, this is not the time for an emotional offensive (ishteyaal). It is a time to convert the legal battle into victory by a patient approach. Among other weaknesses, in an effort to justify triple talaq, the traditions of four sects of Muslims have been mentioned in the affidavit, but there is no mention of the Ahl-e-Hadees and Shia sects (which have reservations about triple talaq). Views of all sects should have been included and it could be argued that everyone has the liberty to follow the traditions of their own sect. The question here is not only of the controversy about triple talaq but of protection of Muslim Personal Law which is guaranteed in our Constitution.” Rashtriya Sahara (October 11) has highlighted the unanimous opinion of some very eminent Ulema and scholars that “All-India Muslim Personal Law Board alone is the representative organisation of Indian Muslims.”
Its report has quoted the elucidation of the chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Maulana Jalaluddin Umri, detailing the long process of talaq as prescribed by Islam and the provision of khula for wives too can also ask for talaq if they find it impossible to live with their husbands on account of misbehaviour and ill-treatment. “The country’s Constitution has given every citizen the right to follow his/her religion and disseminate its teachings. This has been considered a fundamental right.It is the belief of Muslims that no change is possible in the principles of the Quran, Hadees (traditions and sayings of the prophet) and the Shariat till the end of the world (qayamat). The Jamaat whole-heartedly supports the stand of the Personal Law Board on these issues, Maulana Umri has stated. Other eminent Ulema, including Congress MP, Maulana Asrarul Haque Qasmi, and others have expressed the same sentiments about protection of Muslim Personal Law at all cost. Darul Uloom asserts that talaq and polygamy are parts of personal laws and merit protection.
No-booze Bihar
Rashtriya Sahara, in its editorial on October 8, writes: “After the imposition of prohibition, there has been a considerable decline in criminal incidents and road accidents. Cases of domestic violence caused by consumption of alcohol have also recorded a very significant decline.” Jamaat-e-Islami’s bi-weekly, Daawat, in a front page commentary (October 7), writes: “When Gandhi ji had, during the freedom movement, launched a war against alcohol, his main argument was that this evil destroys the human values of good behaviour. It makes human beings barbarous. But the Judges of Patna High Court had said that ban on consumption of alcohol and strict laws against it were against a ‘civilised society’”."

In essence, it admits that triple talaq cannot be done away with but builds in a stronger, more institutionalised system of mediation, checks and balances, before a couple decide on divorce.
To this effect, the model Nikaahnama—which won’t be binding—will have a Hidayatnama (advisory note) that suggests several ways for resolving discord between husband and wife before they finally proceed for talaaq (divorce). Besides, it details the duties of husband and wife and gives extensive information about the Shariat (Islamic Law).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The meeting was presided over by Board President Rabe Hasan Nadwi.
The simplified model Nikaahnama has been divided into three parts:
• The first part gives particulars of husband and wife and also details of witnesses and ‘Meher’ (assured by the groom to be given at time of Talaaq) fixed for the Nikaah.
• To educate both husband and wife before they start their marital life, the Model Nikahnama include a section apprising the bride and the groom of Shariat laws.


 

‘You can’t throw 
Zaheera out’








 

 • Calling the excommunication of Best Bakery witness Zaheera Sheikh by the Majlis-e-Shura in Bhopal wrong, the AIMPLB said: ‘‘As long as a person professes faith in Islam, he or she cannot be thrown out of the community. It is simply not in anyone’s jurisdiction to do so and if any person or body made this declaration, it is absolutely wrong,’’ said Abdul Rahim Qureshi, Board general secretary.

 








• Accepting the fact that they cannot modify the triple talaaq system, Board Assistant General Secretary Abdul Rahim Qureshi said the model Nikaahnama ensures the couple take measures to solve their differences before they decide on a divorce.
In this, the Nikaahnama recommends involvement of family elders. If that doesn’t work, it urges them to seek intervention of Ulemas failing which they can go to Darul Kada (Court of the Shariat) for talaaq.
The draft of this Nikaahnama will be presented at the next general body meeting of the Board. Once the Board clears it, it will be sent across the country."

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said those maintaining silence on the “burning issue” of triple talaq are as “guilty” as those practising it.
Drawing an analogy between triple talaq and the disrobing of ‘Draupadi’ in the Mahabharata, he said, “Those in the political class that are keeping mum need to be put in the dock along with the perpetrators of the crime and their accomplices.”
Reacting sharply, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) termed Adityanath’s remark as “jaahilaanaa” (foolish).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“These days, there is a new debate in the country on a burning issue. Some people are maintaining silence on this issue. This reminds me of the scene in the Mahabharata in which Draupadi is being disrobed and she asks a question to the gathering as to who is responsible for this incident, this sin?” Adityanath said.
“No one uttered even a single word. Only Vidur said people who have committed the crime, the accomplices and those who maintained silence on this issue are equally responsible,” he said, referring to the practice of triple talaq.
Adityanath made these remarks at an event to mark the 91st birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar.
Calling for an end to the Muslim practice of triple talaq the Chief Minister advocated a uniform civil code in the country.
His remarks came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch against the divisive issue of triple talaq, insisting that exploitation of Muslim women should end and justice be done to them.
Modi had, however, deprecated any attempt at creating a “conflict” within the Muslim community on the issue and suggested tackling it through social awareness.
On Adityanath’s statement, AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani said, “I don’t know how to react to the jaahilaanaa (foolish) statement. He is linking talaq with a greater issue — the disrobing of Draupadi. No sane person will do so. He is looking at things using a different lens (doosraa chashmaa).”
The AIMPLB at its meeting at Lucknow on Sunday had asserted that Muslims have a “constitutional” right to follow their personal law of which triple talaq was a part.
Rahmani had said the board has decided to issue a code of conduct and warned that those who give ‘talaq’ (divorce) without following the ‘Sharia’ (Islamic law) will face social boycott.
Adityanath today also referred to the issue of the uniform civil code and said, “Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar had advocated the need for a common civil code in the country. When our issues are similar, then why the laws pertaining to marriages cannot be similar.”
“Chandra Shekhar had a clear understanding of the Common Civil Code. For him, the interest of the nation was more important than his own ideology. Our politics should not revolve around attacking the nation’s interest, but should be within the framework of the Constitution. The day we start working by remaining within the ambit of the Constitution, the situation of conflict and collision will not occur. And, then no one will dare to take law into their own hand,” he said.
All India Shia Personal Law Board spokesperson Maulana Yasoob Abbas said, “Comparing talaq with disrobing of Draupadi is wrong. Triple talaq is wrong, and the also the tendency to remain silent on this issue. Inflicting talaq (divorce) on a woman is a sin, but it cannot be equated with disrobing.”
President of the All India Muslim Woman Personal Law Board Shaista Amber said, “Talaq should not be compared to disrobing of Draupadi. Our Hindu sisters are also beaten up for dowry, the PM and the CM should comment on this issue as well.”
“Watching a crime being committed is also a crime and there should be stringent laws to deal with criminal elements,” she said.
On the AIMPLB’s statement that those who give triple talaq without valid Sharia reasons will face social boycott, Amber said, “Social boycott merely will not suffice as it will not give justice to the oppressed woman.”"

SHAKEEL Alam Saifi, BJP’s lone Muslim candidate in the 2012 UP polls, is in a fix — how will he ask the community to vote for BJP when it has refused ticket to even one Muslim this election. Saifi, the only Muslim to have fought an Assembly election on a BJP ticket in the state since 2002, said: “If the party had given a few tickets to Muslims, we would have been able to go to them and say something. But now it is difficult to seek their votes. How would we ask them to give us votes?”
“It is true that Muslims don’t vote for BJP. But BJP also does not try to get their votes. There are 403 seats in UP and BJP leaders know they are not going to win all. They should have given tickets to a few Muslims on seats they knew they would lose,” he added. Saifi (52), who had contested from Sahaswan seat of Badaun in 2012, came sixth with 2,238 votes. His deposit was forfeited. He, however, maintained that he cannot be singled out as a weak candidate because 229 BJP candidates had lost their deposits in 2012.

A member of BJP Minority Cell’s national executive, Saifi said he had sought a ticket from Muslim-dominated Bilari seat of Moradabad but did not succeed. “I am in the BJP not because I am a Muslim but because I like the party’s nationalist ideology. The party’s election committee has dignity and I am not going to ask why I was not selected as a candidate. They have gone with winnable candidates,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Saifi lives in Majhoula village of Sambhal with his family of 11, which included his wife, six sons, two girls, a daughter-in-law and a granddaughter. A electric generator mechanic, Saifi said he will campaign for the BJP but won’t focus on Muslim areas. He described triple talaq, mentioned in the BJP manifesto released by party president Amit Shah in Lucknow last Saturday, as a non-issue. “Triple talaq is a personal matter for Muslims. They will resolve it themselves. This is an unreasonable issue and the party will not get any support on its basis,” he said.
BJP has promised to take up the issue of triple talaq if Muslim women in the state asked it to do so. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah have raised the issue of triple talaq in their speeches in UP, calling for the end of the practice.
In 1996 and 2002 UP elections, BJP had fielded late Gaffar Khan from Tilhar in Shahjahanpur. but he lost both times. It went on to field two Muslim candidates in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Both lost. While Shah Mohammad, who contested from Azamgarh, came fifth with 34,735 votes, Arif Mohammad Khan lost Kaiserganj seat to SP’s Beni Prasad Verma by over 12,000 votes."

Securing separation through court takes a long time deters prospects of remarriage. (Representational Picture)
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Friday told the Supreme Court that “personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms.”
Submitting its response in connection with the ongoing matter on the ‘triple talaq’ issue, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said, “Personal laws cannot be challenged as violative of Part III of the Constitution.”
“When serious discords develop in a marriage and husband wants to get rid of wife, legal compulsions and time consuming judicial process….in extreme cases husband may resort to illegal criminal ways of getting rid of her by murdering her. In such situations Triple Talaq is a better recourse,” AIMPLB told the apex court.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Marriage is a contract in which both parties are not physically equal. Male is stronger and female is a weaker sex. Securing separation through court takes a long time deters prospects of remarriage,” it added.
The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men’s lust, but it is a social need.
“Muslim women have right to divorce under Khula practice. Issues of Muslim Personal Law are raised in the Supreme Court are for Parliament for decide. The Uniform Civil code is a directive principle and not enforceable. The personal laws are protected by Article 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution as they are acts done in pursuance of a religion,” it added.
The apex court had last week issued notice to the Central Government on the plea of a Muslim woman challenging the Constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’ to end a marriage.
The petitioner Ishrat Jahan has sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.
In her petition, Jahan has asked whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have the custody of her children.
A batch of petitions is being heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and notices have already been issued to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and others.
However, this is not the first such type of petition that has been presented before the Supreme Court as Uttarakhand-based Shayara Banu and the Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh through its president Farah Faiz have raised similar queries.
On July 29, the apex court had favoured a wider debate on the petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq.
All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) president Shaista Ambar has demanded abolishing of the triple talaq system.
Talaq-e-bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing the word “talaq” more than once in a single tuhr (the period between two menstruations) or in a tuhr after coitus or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple-talaq).
The Centre has set up a high-level committee to review the status of women in India and according to reports has recommended a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq (divorce) and polygamy."

Amending the outdated adultery law “based on the presumption of wife being the property of the husband”, introducing a separate legislation for dealing with “honour killings” and removing the gender discrimination inherent in laws that stipulate a lower legal age of marriage for a girl — these are some of the family law reforms suggested by the government-appointed high-level panel.
The report of the committee, which has also asked for a ban on triple talaq and polygamy, will be placed before the Supreme Court which is hearing a petition filed by an Uttarakhand-based Muslim woman appealing against her triple talaq.
The year-old report reviewing the status of women in India, which was never made public, also suggests a slew of other reforms.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In its review of women and family laws with respect to marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance and succession, the 14-member panel has suggested reforms to undo the implicit gender biases in the personal laws for Hindus, Muslims and Christians as also in other legislation on the issue.
The panel cites the recommendations of the 18th law commission to make a case for recognising 18 years as the age of marriage for both sexes. The Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act mandate a lower age for girls at 18 years, as against 21 years for boys which the panel has found to be discriminatory.
It calls for an overhaul of the “archaic” Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code on adultery which can be only used by the husband against the person who has sexual relations with his wife. The panel has also called for definition of the term “cruelty” as it cannot be “completely left to the interpretation of the courts”.
Personal laws for Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis as well as the Special Marriages Act recognise cruelty as a ground for divorce.
The panel holds that the absence of a clear definition in any of these laws creates scope for construing patriarchal notions of wife’s behaviour as cruelty.
“The recommendations of the high-level committee involve wide-ranging changes across personal laws. A decision on it can only be taken after holding nationwide consultations of all stakeholders,” said a senior official from the woman and child development ministry.
The report upholds the right to maintenance for Muslim women in their personal law as well as for women in live-in relationships and unmarried dependent daughters.
It states that the word “maintenance” should be substituted with a more rights-based term like “monetary entitlement”, deletion of the term “illegitimate” child in existing legislation, and discontinuing use of words like “mistresses”, “concubines” or “keeps” in court judgments.
Also proposes standalone law to deal with ‘honour killings’
Taking note of the spate of “honour killings”, the panel has asked for a standalone law to deal with the issue, make police and legal protection mandatory for such couples and ensure punishment for those involved in khap decisions that lead to such killings. Moreover, it has said that the current practice of putting up 30-day public notices under the Special Marriages Act should be done away with as it could put young couples marrying against their parents’ approval at risk."

Judicial interventions in the recent past have ensured equal rights are accorded to both men and women at religious institutions. The Haji Ali Trust that manages the Haji Ali Dargah located off the Mumbai coast on Monday agreed in front of Supreme Court that it will allow women to access the innermost sanctum sanctorum of the shrine.
The move is a major victory for equal rights campaigners. Equal rights has been a contentious issue in India and one that has been boiling in public discourse for many decades.
Apart from the Haji Ali Dargah case, another progressive step was taken recently when a High Court scrapped the restrictions for women to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Shani Shingnapur temple in Nashik. Such decisions give confidence and set a precedent for other cases to follow where equal rights is the core issue. Religious laws and rules have often overridden democratic principles in the country. But, the judiciary is acting to ensure that the status quo shifts to a balanced position from the current patriarchal and gender-biased religious practices.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The trust argued that the Islamic scriptures believe in equal rights for men and women but the ban was imposed because it was a grave sin for women to be near the shrine of a revered saint. The court, however, rightly dismissed such arguments. Finally, the trust has now agreed to allow women access from a separate entry seeking time of four weeks to make the necessary changes in the structure of the building.
Similarly, there are various reasons cited at Hindu temples for banning women like caste, class, gender, blocking entry during menstruation et al. Thousands of women are persecuted across the country for objecting to such practices and it needs to end. Judicial intervention is a concrete solution to end such orthodox practices and one that is relievingly being taken at the highest level at the Supreme Court.
The debate on triple talaq has also boiled down to what it is – a rights issue and not a religious issue. So, these are welcome decisions for the court’s to hear such matters with and delivering swift results that benefit the society. Equal rights in a house of worship is a fundamental right that has been suppressed for centuries due to male chauvinism and that needs to stop regardless of the place of worship – a dargah or a temple or any other place."

"1617717091-51","https://indianexpress.com/page/121/?s=Triple+talaq","Very feeble reform","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/very-feeble-reform/","Very feeble reform","May 3, 2005","The model nikahnama proposed by the Muslim Personal Law Board is, at best, a very modest step forward in the reform of Muslim personal law. While it gives women more protection when it comes to protecting their property and maintenance, it is silent on crucial issues such as age of marriage and the triple talaq. It has taken almost ten years to produce this document. There was great external and internal pressure for reform. The leadership of the Muslim community has relentlessly been accused of keeping the community backward. And, in recent years, sections within the Muslim community, especially among women, have become more vocal in demanding reform. At the present political conjuncture, reform from the outside, except through incremental case law, has been considered unfeasible. It was therefore even more important that the Muslim Personal Law Board showed some initiative in ushering in credible reforms.
Judged by this ambition, the new nikahnama is a colossal failure. The reforms that it proposes would have been radical 50 years ago. In 2005, they are simply a reminder of how much the Muslim Personal Law Board is behind the times. No one expects the Muslim Personal Law Board to doubt the authority of the shariat. But it could be reasonably expected that it would come up with an interpretation of the shariat’s message that protects women’s rights more strongly and brings the institution of marriage more in line with modern realities. Any process of reform has two aspects: the substantive laws enacted and the process by which reforms are carried out. While the Muslim Personal Law Board was more solicitous of a range of opinions than in the past, there are a number of questions about its representative character. Even for those who take the position that each community must be free to reform its personal laws at its own pace, the question of the Muslim Personal Law Board’s representative status remains troubling. Whose views does it represent? How does it ascertain the will of the community? Why should its interpretation of the shariat be solely authoritative? Real reform will have to involve not just incremental changes in the substance of the laws, but the whole process by which these laws acquire their authority. This protracted and feeble attempt at reform will only make these questions more, rather than less, insistent.
The proposed nikahnama should not result in the Muslim Personal Law Board putting the debate over reform of personal law into cold storage. On the contrary, it should persuade Muslims to debate their laws even further. The objective of having a state where marriage laws are independent of religious affiliation, and fully affirm the fullest equality, is still a distant dream. But, in the meantime, the custodians of religious authority would do better than to come up with half-baked reform measures that are possibly out of tune with the needs and aspirations of their communities."

Activists of the hardline AIMIM party today staged a demonstration in the city to protest against UP minister Swami Prasad Maurya’s controversial comments on ‘triple talaq’ and burnt his effigy. Led by AIMIM’s district president Chaudhary Ibrahim and its city unit chief Afsar Mahmood, hundreds of agitators gathered in the heart of the city and raised slogans against the minister who, while defending the BJP’s stand on triple talaq, had said that those taking recourse to the regressive social practice “change their wives to satisfy their lust”.
Torching the effigy of Maurya, the agitators said the minister’s statement in Basti district on Friday was “mean, shameful, deplorable and an affront to Sharia law”. Led by the Owaisi brothers from Hyderabad, the AIMIM had made its debut in Uttar Pradesh in the recent assembly polls.
However, it failed to make a mark in any of the seats it had contested and got a measly 0.2 per cent of the total number of votes polled. Maurya, who holds the Labour portfolio in the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet, is a powerful OBC leader who quit the Mayawati-led BSP last year and later joined the BJP."

From triple talaq to Islamophobia, from the “insecurity” that he sees in the “amplification of the azaan” to the now factious subject of nationalism and minorities, there was no subject that actor Saif Ali Khan shied away from during an interview, a day after he was the guest at Express Adda in Mumbai (full transcript to be published this week).
“Nationalism is amazing and important for development, but is that the same as Hinduism? I don’t think so. In a country that has been secular, there are minorities, it will make them uncomfortable. This doesn’t apply to me because my world is more privileged, insular,” he said, adding, “So I don’t mind living in a Hindu State either, just make the law same for everyone.”

With the spotlight now on the practice of triple talaq in the Muslim community, Khan spoke about how his personal experience had shaped his view on the matter. “I’ve had a nikaah before and a divorce. But I didn’t think that triple talaq was the way. I had financial responsibilities towards my ex-wife and children. So I don’t agree with triple talaq because I haven’t followed it. And the Indian Constitution addresses this with the Special Marriage Act. Kareena (Kapoor) and I got married under the Act,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Known to speak his mind, the 46-year-old pointed out that while he personally doesn’t feel “boxed in” by his religious identity, the rise in Islamophobia across the world does make him fearful. “It feels like you will be persecuted or discriminated against no matter how you are,” he said, while pointing out that “there is no such thing as ‘the Muslim’ or ‘the Jew’”.
“We create the construct of the Muslim and give it certain characteristics, that he does this or that, when we are all individuals and different. It’s scary when we are all called ‘the Muslim’ because it implies we have the same beliefs and characteristics that can be easily summed up,” he said.
Kashmir, he admitted, was a complicated issue. “Sitting in our living rooms”, he said, it was difficult to comment on the Army’s actions as “it’s a war zone out there, but we also cannot be jingoistic about it without understanding the complications of the subject”.
About the ban on Pakistani artistes by the film industry, Khan said he understands the sentiment but said the film industry shouldn’t be singled out for such a ban and that there needs to be a “common law for all trades with the neighbouring country”. On a lighter note, Khan said actors from Pakistan were seen as more “exotic”.
Speaking of insecurities in his own industry, he said, “We live in a fear-based industry. That is the motivator, the prime mover. People work out of fear. Somebody once asked me if I could wear a pale blue suit. I said, ‘No, I don’t like this colour.’ I saw Aamir (Khan) smiling. He said, ‘You shouldn’t say that. Just tell them that it’s unlucky for you. They’ll never bring it again.’”
On the row over singer Sonu Nigam’s statement against the use of loudspeakers by mosques for the azaan, Khan said he understands both positions. “At one level, I agree, the lesser sound the better, but I also understand the amplification of the sound during azaan comes from a certain insecurity, not just here, but also in Israel, apparently, where three different religions co-exist. As a minority, you would like to make your presence felt and hopefully, accepted. If someone says that it should be extinguished, that’s bound to make some people a little uncomfortable.”
The actor struck an emotional note when he spoke about his daughter Sara and her decision to choose a Bollywood career. “I tell her she should focus on the creativity and not get caught up in the politics around it. One worries as to what will happen.but you don’t own your children. You can only provide them with a good education and emotional support,” he said."

(Representational image)
Muslim women in Kerala divorced under triple talaq practice would now get free legal aid under an initiative launched by the state minorities commission amid a debate over the issue across the country.
The initiative was formally launched on Wednesday and 21 complaints were received from women who were divorced and left to fend for themselves, commission sources said. The commission, headed by retired judge P K Haneefa, has formed panels comprising four women advocates each in all 14 districts of the state to give the women appropriate advice and legal assistance.
The divorced women can approach the members of the panel in their respective districts for legal advice and assistance free of cost to fight their cases, Haneefa said. The commission, constituted for the comprehensive educational advancement, welfare, protection and empowerment of minorities in the state, has published phone numbers (0471-2315122, 2318122) for women to approach the panelists.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“After hearing the plaint, the panel advocates will give advice on whether to move a suit before court or to approach police or other authorities concerned for getting redressal of their complaints,” Haneefa said. Women, living in any part of the state, can contact the panelists through the phone numbers and seek help in this regard, he said.
“Many women from various parts of the state have already come up with complaints of triple talaq,” he said. Commission sources said that most of the complainants who have approached the panel belong to the 25-49 age group. A 63-year-old retired school headmistress, who has been fighting to get compensation from her former husband for the past seven years, is one among those who has approached the commission for justice.
Another woman from Malappuram, who was divorced under the triple talaq practice 22 years ago, wanted some compensation to carry forward her life as she is living at the mercy of her relatives and has no children. A 40 year-old woman from Erumeli in Kottayam district has been fighting for justice for the past 10 years, sources added.
The practice of triple talaq has been challenged before the Supreme Court which last month decided that a Constitution Bench would hear the petitions from May 11. The apex court had said the Muslim practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy are issues that are “very important” and involve “sentiments”.
The Kerala High Court last year had come out against triple talaq, saying that equality before law has been denied to Muslim women in the country due to the practice. Disposing of three cases involving divorced Muslim women, including change of name of spouse in the passport of a person who had ended his marriage by triple talaq, the court had stressed the need for a codified law with regard to divorce."

Explaining the Centre’s stand on the issue of triple talaq, the top law officer said there cannot be a situation in a secular country where women of one religion have same right as their spouse but women of another religion, who may be living next door, will not have the same right.
Rohatgi’s comments came a day after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) said that it has decided to issue a code of conduct and warned that those who give talaq (divorce) without ‘Sharia’ (Islamic law) reasons will face social boycott.
The Supreme Court is already seized of the issue of triple talaq and is scheduled to hear a batch of petitions on it from May 11 onwards.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Government of India has filed an affidavit supporting the challenge saying such practices should not be allowed in a secular nation where there is no distinction between caste, creed, colour or religion or on gender equality.
“Women have as much right as men. Both have fundamental rights and one cannot be treated on a lower pedestal. And this constitutes 50 per cent of women of one religion.
“So can we have a situation where women of other religions have as much right as their spouse but women of another religion, who may be living next door or in the same house, will not have the same rights,” Rohatgi said.
He said that the Centre’s stand is such practices are unconstitutional and they should not be allowed, adding, “The women should not be treated in this fashion. This also amounts to disrespect and that’s the strategy we have taken.”
On the stand of the AIMPLB, Rohatgi said, “Now if the board also feels that these kinds of practices are not good. They should have the courage to tell this to the Supreme Court. They should come forward and say that these practices are pernicious and they are not part of their religion.”
Several Muslim women have challenged the practice of triple talaq in which the husband can give talaq thrice in one go, even over the phone or through a text message.
Nikah halala is a practice intended to curb incidence of divorce under which a man cannot remarry his former wife without her having to go through the process of marrying someone else, consummating it, getting divorced, observing the separation period called ‘iddat’ and then coming back to him again."

“Political differences will always be there. There has to be tolerance among political parties. We must respect each other,” he said on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi.
Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Supriyo was on wednesday attacked with bricks allegedly by Trinamool Congress activists in Asansol when he was on way to a police station to stage a protest against the arrest of some BJP workers.
On the issue of triple talaq, Naidu said many Muslim countries have banned the practice, while it continues in India because of the self-interest of some political parties.
“There is no question of forcing anything on anybody…Any religion on anybody. This government does not interfere in religious affairs of anyone at all. When we talk of triple talaq, our aim is justice and equality for women, he said."
"1617717154-68","https://indianexpress.com/page/120/?s=Triple+talaq","Listen,Mister","https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/listen-mister/","Listen,Mister","August 26, 2009 11:45:12 pm","In case you didnt know it already,scriptwriter,lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar can do many things with words: entertain,enthral,entrap. If Muslims were to fear Allah even 10 per cent of the fear they have of fellow Muslims,it would make them better Muslims and more sensible human beings too, I have heard him say in public gatherings of Muslims in Mumbai,Delhi,Lucknow,Kanpur,Allahabad,Hyderabad,Aligarh Muslim University. The spontaneous response to this apparently provocative statement everywhere is assenting nods,sheepish smiles,loud guffaws. 
What Javed Akhtar keeps saying in public,a top drawer maulana from the Jamiat-ul-ulema-e-Hind told me in private last year. The biggest hurdles before us, he said,are the Urdu press (read Muslim media) and Muslim leaders. In the name of Islam anything goes. And he who dares utter the dissenting word had better beware!
But if Muslims are so terrified of fellow Muslims,what so frightens the Law Commission of India as to prefer public embarrassment to plainspeak? The commissions 277th report,recently made public,observes that the traditional understanding of Muslim law on bigamy is gravely faulty and conflicts with true Islamic law in letter and spirit. Well said. But look where it goes from there. It proposes a new clause in Hindu family law to abort sham conversions purely for bigamys sake but,mindful of something called religious sensibilities,stays totally mum about what must necessarily be done with the countrys Muslim Personal Law. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Dr Tahir Mahmood,a jurist specialising in Islamic Law,Hindu Law,Religion and Law and Law Relating to Minorities,is one of the commissions members. There can be no doubt that he is party to if not the prime inspiration behind its observations on bigamy in Islam. Spare a thought for the man: it has been more than apparent for some years now that he is torn between his conscience and his community. His knowledge of Islam tells him that sections of the Muslim Personal Law are anything but Islamic. His knowledge of the Muslim world including the Islamic states also tells him that country after Muslim country has introduced wide-ranging reforms,often with the concurrence of the mullahs,in recent decades. 
For example,the minimum age for marriage for a girl is 16 years in Pakistan,Egypt,Indonesia and Malaysia; 17 years in Lebanon,Syria and Tunisia; and 18 in Algeria,Morocco and Jordan. But the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in its wisdom demanded some years ago that Muslim girls in India be exempted from the provisions of the law restraining child marriage.  
Polygamy is banned in Tunisia,Turkey and Lebanon (for some sects) while it is severely restricted in others. Pakistan permits second marriage under certain conditions but only after following specified procedures that include convincing the Union Council that the husband has the prior consent of his current wife. In Malaysia,a man may marry again only with consent from a Shariah Court. In Indonesia,women who are public servants are prohibited from becoming a second wife. In addition to following regular permission procedures,a male government servant must obtain the permission of his superiors before marrying a second wife. Formal court procedures are obligatory for second marriages in Bangladesh,Singapore and Philippines. In the early 90s,a division bench of the Dhaka high court comprising of two Muslim judges ruled that,read in the modern context,the Quranic injunction on marriage can only have one meaning: monogamy. In a changed political climate however,the judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The privileged Indian Muslim male,however,is under no constraint whatsoever. To top it all,a fatwa issued in Hyderabad two years ago held that it is perfectly Islamic for a Muslim male to marry four women in one go!
Algeria,Indonesia and Tunisia do not recognise talaq (a husbands unilateral right to end a marriage). Divorce is possible only through the courts. In Morocco,talaq is subject to strict judicial control. In Jordan,Lebanon,Malaysia and Syria you have to apply for permission to divorce. Besides,in most of these countries,a reconciliation attempt is mandatory prior to divorce. In Iran,two witnesses are essential for a talaq. Only in India does the Muslim male enjoy the unquestioned right of instant (triple) talaq. Whether sober or dead drunk,in a fit of anger or on a mere whim,he can do so when he likes,how he likes: orally face-to-face,letter,telegram,telephone,fax,e-mail or SMS.
In Tunisia,Morocco and Turkey,both parents have equal rights in child custody and guardianship on divorce. In India,however,the father enjoys the natural right over children. In terms of gender justice,Morocco,a hereditary monarchy,is perhaps the best place for a Muslim woman today. With the new family code,introduced by King Mohammed VI in October 2003 and unanimously adopted by the parliament in February 2004,Moroccan men and women are now equal partners in marriage. The husband is no longer head of the family; both husband and wife now have joint responsibility for the family.
In short,paradoxical as it sounds,in secular India Muslim women have far less rights than their counterparts in numerous Muslim countries. Being a learned man and a believing Muslim,Dr Mahmood cannot but be painfully aware of this rampant male-centrism in Islams name. What can he do? In the midst of so many Muslims either blissfully ignorant of the faith they adore or sworn to the Hypocrisy Oath,he thinks it prudent to measure his words. 
Indias Mr Muslim proudly proclaims there is no place for the clergy in Islam. Yet,he is happy to outsource all knowledge of Islam to the very clergy whose existence he questions. As a result he knows little about Islam except that it is the only valid passport to paradise. Armed with this certainty,he is content being a hostage of the maulvi sahib and his male chauvinist Islam. This gender unjust Islam,Mr Muslim,is something to be ashamed,not proud,of.

Divorce granted by ecclesiastical tribunal under Christian personal law are not valid as it cannot override the law, the Supreme Court said today as it rejected a PIL that sought according legal sanction to such separations granted by the Church Court.
A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud dismissed the plea filed by Clarence Pais, a former president of a Karnataka Catholic association, saying the issue has been settled by it in its 1996 verdict delivered in the case of Molly Joseph versus George Sebastian.

“Canon Law (personal law of Christians) can have theological or ecclesiastical implications to the parties. But after the Divorce Act came into force, a dissolution or annulment granted under such personal law cannot have any legal impact as statute has provided a different procedure and a different code for divorce or annulment,” the apex court had then ruled.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pais, in his PIL filed in 2013, had said the divorce granted by a Church, set up under its personal law, should be considered valid under the Indian common law as was done in the case of Muslims with regard to ‘triple talaq’.
Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, appearing for Pais, had contended that when oral ‘triple talaq’ could get legal sanctity for granting divorce to Muslim couples, why could Canon law decrees not be made binding on courts of law.
He had alleged that many Catholic Christians, who married after getting divorce from Christian courts, faced criminal charges of bigamy as such divorces are not recognised by the criminal and civil courts.
Pais, in his plea, had said, “It is reasonable that when the courts in India recognise dissolution of marriage (by pronouncing the word talaq three times) under Mohammedan Law which is Personal law of the Muslims, the courts should also recognise for the purpose of dissolution of marriage Canon Law as the personal law of the Indian Catholics.”
The plea contended that Canon Law is the personal law of Catholics and has to be applied and enforced by a criminal court while deciding a case under section 494 (bigamy) of IPC.
“This is also applicable for sanction of prosecution considered for alleged bigamy of a Catholic spouse who has married after obtaining a decree for nullity of the first marriage from the Ecclesiastical Tribunal (Christian court),” it had said.
The Centre, however, had opposed the plea saying Canon law cannot be allowed to override Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and Divorce Act, 1869.
“Since the power for dissolution of marriage has been vested in the court, there is no scope for any other authority including ecclesiastical tribunal to exercise power,” the government had said.
The Indian Divorce Act, 1869 prescribes separate procedures for grant of decree of divorce and the apex court had held that “any declaration of marriage to be void by Ecclesiastical Tribunal”, will not be binding on the courts.
It had said “such Ecclesiastical Tribunal cannot exercise a power parallel to the power of District Court or the High Court which have been vested in the District Court and the High Court by the provisions of the Divorce Act’s Section 18 which provides that any husband or wife may present a petition to the District Court or to the High Court praying that his or her marriage may be declared null and void.
“In that event, it excludes the jurisdiction and authority of any other Tribunal or Court including Ecclesiastical Tribunal (Church Court).”"

VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi on Saturday said women should be allowed entry into temples but they may be restricted during the periods.
Speaking to reporters after visiting the Sai Baba temple, Prachi said not allowing women in temples in the modern times is wrong.

“However, the entry of women can be restricted for five days of month during their periods,” she said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Lashing out at those who do not want to say ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai‘, she said such people “should be thrown out of the country or dumped into the Indian ocean”.
The trustees of Shani temple at Shingnapur in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra yesterday allowed women to enter its core area for the first time following an agitation and a High Court order.
Supporting the women’s agitation for gaining entry into religious places, Prachi said those discriminating against the women must realise they “didn’t fall out of sky or emerged from the earth” and it was a woman which gave birth to them.
She also deplored the practises such as triple talaq among the Muslim community."

Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), an Indian Muslim women’s rights organisation, is training women to be qazis, or judges, a role traditionally reserved for men, amid growing demand for more representation for women.
The organisation is training its first intake of 30 women in Quranic law, constitutional law and gender rights. The year-long programme aims to produce a steady stream of female qazis across India, its co-founder said.

The Indian constitution allows Muslims, the country’s biggest religious minority, to regulate matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance through their own civil code.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The qazi, usually a hereditary title, plays an important role by solemnising marriage and finalising divorce and settlements.
“Traditionally, qazis have all been men, and their judgment has never been questioned, even if many are unfair to women,” said Zakia Soman, a co-founder of BMMA in Mumbai.
“But it’s important to have women hear and represent women who are in a vulnerable position. Besides, there is no bar on women qazis as per the Quran,” she said.
The move comes at a time of growing dissent against laws that activists say discriminate against Muslim women. A survey by BMMA last year showed more than 90 percent of Muslim women want to end the “triple talaq” divorce tradition and polygamy.
Last month, the Supreme Court said it would examine how far it could interfere in Muslim laws, as it heard a plea to end the practice allowing Muslim men to divorce their wives by saying “talaq” three times.
Muslims make up 13 percent of India’s 1.2 billion population, yet government data show they are among some of the most excluded and marginalised communities.
The women being trained to be qazis are largely community workers and activists from states including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Bihar, Soman said.
There are some female qazis in Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia.
Women qazis in India can help prevent child marriage, ensure that a woman marries willingly, and that a divorce is only granted after a period of reconciliation, and with fair terms for the woman, Soman said.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a non-governmental institution that oversees the application of Muslim personal law in the country, has criticised the female qazis.
“Women don’t have the right to be a qazi,” said Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali, secretary of AIMPLB.
“Besides, there is no need – there are enough men who are qazis. So it’s completely unnecessary,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
But female trainee Safia Akhtar said there was a need for women qazis.
“There are many grave injustices against Muslim women, and we deserve a say in matters that concern us,” said Akhtar in the city of Bhopal.
“If women can be prime ministers and pilots in this country, then why can’t we also be qazis?”"

The central government Monday maintained that Islamic practices such as triple talaq and polygamy “impact the social status and dignity of women” and urged the Supreme Court to declare them unconstitutional.
In its written submission on a clutch of matters which would be examined by a five-judge Constitution Bench during the summer vacation, the government said Islam too did not sanction these practices and that they existed due to social norms centuries ago.

“Practices such as polygamy cannot be described as being sanctioned by religion… polygamy prevailed across communities for several centuries, including the ancient Greeks and Romans, Hindus, Jews and Zoroastrians. It had less to do with religion and more to do with social norms at the time,” stated the note. The note stated that triple talaq rendered Muslim women vulnerable and without any security, unlike women of other religions."

IN A FIRST, at least 15 judges of the Supreme Court, comprising more than half its strength today, will be sitting through prolonged hearings in the forthcoming summer vacation to deal with three cases of Constitutional importance, including the validity of triple talaq and polygamy under Muslim personal laws. Chief Justice of India J S Khehar disclosed Thursday that he has approved three separate Constitution Benches during the vacation to examine issues, which if not heard now, “will not be decided for years together.”
There has been a practice of having a two-judge bench during the vacation to hear some cases but this would be the first time when 15 out of 28 judges in the apex court would be spending a substantial part of their vacation hearing arguments, making notes and preparing judgments. Apart from triple talaq and polygamy, the CJI said that these five-judge Benches will hear matters related to the right to privacy for WhatsApp and Facebook users in India and the issue of providing Indian citizenship to children of illegal migrants born in this country.

“These are very, very important matters. If we don’t do it like this (by hearing them in separate Constitution Benches), they will not be decided for years and years together. Then you (lawyers) don’t blame us that it did not happen…or that there are so much arrears,” remarked Justice Khehar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A bench comprising the CJI and Justice D Y Chandrachud was fixing a date of hearing for a batch of matters relating to validity of triple talaq and polygamy when the fact of three separate larger benches came up.
Justice Khehar said that it has been decided that a Constitution Bench should hear the batch of cases of triple talaq, starting May 11 — the top court goes on leave for the summer vacation from this date. He added that the issues could be framed over May 11-12 hearing, and then the arguments could commence the next week.
The CJI further revealed that two separate Constitution Benches will also sit in the vacation to hear the cases pertaining to right to privacy for uses of social media and online chat groups and on the citizenship row.
This disclosure however did not go down well with Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi and some senior lawyers, including Kapil Sibal and Raju Ramachandran. The lawyers pointed out that they were supposed to appear in all the three cases and therefore, it would not be feasible to have all the three Constitution Bench matters in the vacation.
Rohatgi rued: “These are all very important matters as far as I am concerned and I am appearing in all three. How will I attend all of them at the same time? Working in the vacation has been a bilateral issue and the tradition of this court has been to fix the matters after taking into account the convenience of the lawyers. It cannot be a compulsion.”
To this, the CJI replied that there was no compulsion on any lawyer and that he could make a choice regarding the case he deems most important. “Besides, all of you won’t be arguing in all the cases at the same time. You can take your turns. These won’t be decided for years if we don’t it now,” he retorted.
On his part, Sibal reminded Justice Khehar that he had been asked by the CJI to assist the court in the WhatsApp matter relating to the right to privacy. “But three parallel benches during the vacation will be a lot of burden. I can assist in one but not in all. If the lordship so desires, I will withdraw my consent from the WhatsApp matter if everything is to taken up simultaneously by different benches,” contended the senior lawyer.
“We exempt you from everything,” responded the CJI, as he stood firm that there could be no assurance that all the three matters will not be heard simultaneously."

“No Indian Muslim woman would have ever gone to the court if the Muslim Personal Board had actually sat down and said yes there is a problem and said that they will sit and try to find out a solution,” she told ANI.
Her reactions came after the AIMPLB, a Muslim body governing personal affairs according to Islamic Law Code Shariat, filed an affidavit in the apex court, stating that “personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She said that the solution to the triple talaq problem is that it should be counted as one talaq but not the final divorce.
“The only thing they (AIMPLB) need to do is, they need to say that if talaq is pronounced at a single time thrice, it should be considered as one talaq and not the final talaq,” she said.
She further said that no Muslim woman is questioning the Sharia law or the Quran but the board must recognise that it is the misinterpretation of the law that is creating problem for women and should thus, reassess the Personal Law.
“No Muslim woman is questioning Sharia. No Muslim woman is questioning any of the things written in the Quran. With all respect to Quran, we love Islam. But the only thing is that misinterpretation of the Sharia law is creating a lot of problem for the Muslim women and its time now that the Personal Law Board should sit down and codify the Personal Law within its own ambit,” said Shafiq.
She added that the board is right in saying that the court cannot intervene in the Personal Law, but at the same time it needs to acknowledge that Muslim women are facing problems.
“What the Personal Law Board is trying to say is absolutely right when they say that the court does not intervene as far as Personal Law is concerned, but, at the same time they do not acknowledge that Indian Muslim women are facing problems,” she said.
She also pointed out that even within the AIMPLB, women are under-represented, which makes the composition of the board unequal.
“The Personal Law Board does not have equality in terms of representation as far as Muslim women are concerned. The board itself has an unequal composition. There are very few women as compared to men within the board,” said the former NCW member.
She further said that it is really unfortunate that the entire affidavit submitted by the AIMPLB talks about whether the court can intervene or not and what are the rights of men under the Muslim Personal Law Board, but, not even once the board has acknowledged that Muslim women have a problem with triple talaq and said that it will look into the matter within the ambit of Personal Law.
The AIMPLB on Friday told the Supreme Court that “personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms” as the board submitted its response in connection with the ongoing matter on the ‘triple talaq’ issue.
“When serious discords develop in a marriage and husband wants to get rid of wife, legal compulsions and time consuming judicial process….in extreme cases husband may resort to illegal criminal ways of getting rid of her by murdering her. In such situations Triple Talaq is a better recourse,” AIMPLB told the apex court.
The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men’s lust, but it is a social need.
“Muslim women have right to divorce under Khula practice. Issues of Muslim Personal Law are raised in the Supreme Court are for Parliament for decide. The Uniform Civil code is a directive principle and not enforceable. The personal laws are protected by Article 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution as they are acts done in pursuance of a religion,” it added.
The apex court had last week issued notice to the Central Government on the plea of a Muslim woman challenging the Constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’ to end a marriage.
The petitioner Noor Jahan has sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.
In her petition, Jahan has asked whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have the custody of her children.
A batch of petitions is being heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and notices have already been issued to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and others.
All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) president Shaista Ambar has demanded abolishing of the triple talaq system.
Talaq-e-bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing the word “talaq” more than once in a single tuhr (the period between two menstruations) or in a tuhr after coitus or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple-talaq).
The Centre has set up a high-level committee to review the status of women in India and according to reports has recommended a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq (divorce) and polygamy."

Women activists on Friday slammed the All India Muslim Personal Law Board for its counter-affidavit in Supreme Court on triple talaq saying the Muslim body has turned a blind eye to the plight of women suffering due to this practice. All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the apex court that personal laws can’t be “re-written” in the name of social reforms and “courts cannot supplant its own interpretations over the text of scriptures”.
Noorjehan Safia Niaz, co-founder of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), which is one of the petitioners, said, “No one can stop the citizen of this country to approach the court. That is a right Muslim women also have… Lot of rights have been given to Muslim women in the Quran but these are the people (AIMPLB) who are sitting on them and not allowing women to access them because of patriarchy.”
“… AIMPLB has been completely obstinate and rigid and there is no point talking to bodies like these. So, SC will be approached and it will have the right to interpret.” She also claimed that the practice of triple talaq is un-Quranic as the religious text insists on mandatory arbitration for seeking divorce. CPI-M leader Brinda Karat said, “AIMPLB has refused to listen to the many pleas of women on the complete unfairness of arbitrary triple talaq.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“… Muslim women have raised certain questions before Supreme Court and AIMPLB’s reaction is to completely ignore these legitimate questions being raised by women who have suffered because of this practice, which exists in no other country in the world except India.”
Renowned women’s right activist Kamla Bhasin said it is AIMPLB which is being un-Quranic. “Through Quran, Prophet Mohammad challenged all the existing religions and tradition to move towards equality and justice and that was the main goal of his life… He also said that after me if there is injustice, wise people of that time can take a decision. He gave people the right to re-interpret.”
“… I feel that these men (AIMPLB) are not following what Quran had to say,” said Bhasin.
She added, “Our most important religious, oral, ethical book is our Constitution. If any religion goes against that it needs to be challenged and changed.”"

Breaking his silence on the row over the issue of triple talaq, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday denounced the practice among Muslims and slammed “some political parties” who “in their hunger for votes” are “bent upon perpetrating this injustice on Muslim women in the 21st Century”.
Speaking at a BJP rally in Mahoba in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister, referring to the issue of triple talaq, drew a parallel with female foeticide and the punishment it entails.

“If a Hindu kills a daughter in her mother’s womb, that person has to go behind bars. Similarly, how is my Muslim sister at fault if someone just utters talaq thrice over the telephone and destroys her life,” he said.
“Shouldn’t the rights of Muslim daughters be protected? Shouldn’t Muslim mothers and sisters be protected? Shouldn’t Muslim sisters get equal rights? Some Muslim sisters fought for their rights in court. The Supreme Court asked us, what is the stand of the Government of India. We replied in very clear terms that no injustice should be done to mothers and sisters, that no discrimination should take place in the name of religion,” Modi said.
“I am astonished that some political parties, in their hunger for votes, are bent upon perpetrating this injustice on Muslim women in the 21st Century. What kind of justice is this? Elections and politics have their own place but it is the responsibility of government and society to ensure that India’s Muslim women get their rights, and get their rights under the Constitution of India,” the Prime Minister said.
PTI adds from Mahoba: Asking the media not to turn the issue of triple talaq as a matter between the government and the opposition, Modi said, “The debate should be between knowledgeable persons from Muslim community who know the Quran.

“When you do TV debate, do not turn it into Hindu-Muslim issues. Debate should be between those who want change in Muslim society and those who do not want 125 crore Indians to know what is the issue,” the Prime Minister said."

The Centre is set to inform the Supreme Court that the practice of triple talaq is unconstitutional and also against gender equality. While doing so, the government will also refer to the secular character of the country, arguing that the practice is “unfair, discriminatory and unreasonable”, highly placed sources told The Indian Express Friday.
However, the focus will be on underlining the anti-gender equality character of the system of triple talaq. The Centre’s response to the issue was firmed up after meetings between representatives of the Union ministries of Home, Finance, Women and Child Development and Law.

“The government view that will be enunciated in the Supreme Court would be that the issue has to be viewed through the prism of gender justice and not uniform civil code. That is why it needs to be decided in view of the rights of the gender and gender equality,” said the source.
Elaborating, the source said, “Faith is protected under our fundamental rights but practices like triple talaq aren’t. Practices that are unconstitutional should be put an end to.”
The Centre is expected to file a detailed response on the issue in the Supreme Court soon.
A bench headed by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur is hearing a bunch of petitions questioning the legal validity of the practice of triple talaq.
“Nearly 20 Islamic countries, including those in India’s neighbourhood like Pakistan and Bangladesh, have already regulated the matrimony laws, including triple talaq. There has not been a plea in these countries that such regulations are not in compliance with Sharia laws. So anybody who takes such a plea in India is wrong,” said the source."

Khehar’s appointment of a five-judge bench during the Supreme Court’s summer vacation to consider the issues of Triple Talaq, Nikah-e-Halala (mandatory marriage of a divorced Muslim woman and its consummation with another man and divorce from him if she has to remarry her husband who had divorced her), and polygamy are a laudable and unprecedented step. Inquilab, in a commentary on April 2, writes: “The legality of these three practices has been challenged under Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Indian Constitution. The concerned petition has been filed in the SC under Article 32 of the Constitution which fully authorises the SC to issue a special order (writ) to declare unconstitutional and reject any social, religious or legal tradition or practice (rasm-o-rawaaj).”
The paper adds: “In reply to the 33-page application by Saira Bano (a divorced woman), the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board has filed a 70-page affidavit. On reading this affidavit, anyone who has knowledge of either the Indian Constitution and or Islamic laws can only fret and fume. As a legal document this affidavit is absolutely hollow and unworthy of any serious consideration by the court. It is also full of contradictory statements and any lawyer would not be able to either reply to the possible questions of the court… The affidavit very clearly points out that Triple Talaq is right according to the Quran and the hadeeses (sayings and traditions of the prophet Mohammad). It should be noted that Triple Talaq is considered haraam (forbidden) among the Shia and Ahl-e-Hadees sects… Experts of Islamic law from Ameer Ali to (A.A.A) Fyzee and Justice Hidayatullah to Professor Tahir Mehmood have declared Triple Talaq illegal. In 25 Muslim countries, Talaq of this type has been banned. The Pakistan Supreme Court too has declared this practice unconstitutional… Historically, it has been proved (and there is no difference between ulema on this) that Hazrat Umar had put limits on those who gave Triple Talaq, that meant that they were flogged, apart from the Talaq being annulled… Many customs, practices and traditions of other religious groups, including Hinduism, have been rejected and law has been framed against such practices… Several courts have given judgements that do not conform to Muslim Personal Law but the Personal Law Board has never challenged these judgements.”
Hamara Samaj, in its editorial on April 1, writes: “This is an extremely serious matter that must be sorted out. The SC’s show of seriousness is laudable. If the court silences the contesting parties with a just and satisfactory judgement, it would give a boost to people’s confidence in the judiciary.”
UP CM’s Meat Focushttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rashtriya Sahara (April 3) writes: “Following loud proclamations by PM Narendra Modi during the Uttar Pradesh election about “sab ka saath, sab ka vikas”, the government of UP, under Yogi Adityanath, took up imposing a ban on illegal slaughterhouses and meat shops as its first focus. Even legal slaughterhouses and meat shops were sealed on orders from the chief minister… The new guidelines regarding the sale of meat issued by the government are very difficult, if not impossible, to implement… The worst-affected are from Muslim and Dalit communities… The question is: Why are such strict conditions put on sellers of meat when there are a number of small traders of eatables who are operating by the roadside and are victims of extortion by police and administration? …In milk and ghee, there is adulteration and use of chemicals to make illegitimately high profit. If the government is actually concerned about the health of the people, it should be equally strict about monitoring other trades too.”
Akhbar-e-Mushriq, in its editorial on April 1, writes: “Following the UP CM’s statement about illegal slaughterhouses, BJP workers were infuriated (taish mein aa gaye). In the crackdown, along with sellers of buffalo meat, sellers of mutton, chicken and even eggs were not spared and the situation took the form of a Muslim-government confrontation… The campaign against meat trade is a form of cultural fascism.”
Questioning EVMs
Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have been under much discussion following doubts expressed by senior leaders. Jadeed Khabar, in its editorial on April 3, writes: “After reports of a mock trial of EVMs at Bhind in Madhya Pradesh (where pressing any button reportedly showed a vote for BJP) the moral pressure on the EC has increased. But even now, the commission is claiming EVMs to be tamper-free and has rejected all accusations in this regard…The BJP had been rejecting all accusations, intoxicated as it was by its success in UP and Uttarakhand… It is the same BJP which had raised innumerable allegations against EVMs in the past. The party’s General Secretary, G.V.L Narasimha Rao, had even written a book on misuse of EVMs whose foreword was written by L.K. Advani and Subramanian Swamy had made a virulent speech against EVMs at its release function.”
Sahafat, in a commentary by Rajat Mona, a noted scientist and a member of Election Commission’s expert technical group for EVMs, says that “EVM machines are free from any kind of tampering.”"

Malkan, addressing a press conference on the Sangh’s recent all-India meet in Telangana, said: “There have been some incidents in Gujarat which brought bitterness among societies and to bring harmony and peace, over 200 meetings were held in Gujarat.”
He also said that the incidents of attacks on Dalits and the Patidar quota movement are products of “intellectual terrorism”. Advocating abolition of triple talaq, he said like the Hindus who ended “sati pratha”, which had become a social evil, the Muslims should also do away with triple talaq.

"1617716952-14","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Unlikely Hero","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/unlikely-hero/","Unlikely Hero","November 24, 2002","Her small frame does not give out that Zeenat Fatima Rashid has fought and won a 12-year-old battle in an unending war against triple talaq. Nor do her self-effacing denials — ‘‘I am not the only woman to have fought this battle…I have only proved that triple talaq is not as easy as it is traditionally believed.’’
Zeenat, in fact, has little to even celebrate about. While she was looking after their nine-month-old son, studying law herself and doing the rounds of courts to get the talaq her husband pronounced on her null and void, her husband Iqbal Anwar went ahead and got married again. Since the Supreme Court order on August 14, he has been urging Zeenat to return home. But she is back in courts trying to get that marriage cancelled on account of bigamy. She vows she will be back, but as Iqbal’s only wife.

Zeenat’s problems began in 1990 when one August morning, Iqbal turned on her, repeated talaq thrice and threw Zeenat out of their house along with their son. Zeenat had no choice but to return to her father’s place.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But the rest didn’t follow the script. Instead of moping and accepting it as fate, Zeenat went to a lawyer, personally went through volumes of interpretations of the Muslim Personal Law and the Shariat Act and decided to fight back. To boost her case, she also took a degree in law. ‘‘I wanted to know the law thoroughly so that there were no loopholes,’’ the teacher at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Maligaon, says.




‘Message has to go across to entire         Muslim society’




• Are you happy         with the judgement?
         I am definitely happy, though I have so far won only half the battle.         The bigamy case is still pending, and I am yet to be recognised as the         only wife of my husband. I have proved the point that triple talaq is         not that easy as has been traditionally believed.
         • What will be the fallout and impact         of the judgement?
         It is for the Muslim society to analyse and understand the inherent message         of this judgement and then ensure that hundreds of women are not subjected         to humiliation and pushed to a disastrous situation because some people         have been misinterpreting the Shariat laws and the holy Quran. I want         to clarify that I am not the only woman to have fought this battle. There         have been a few more who have won similar cases. What I feel is that this         and similar cases be discussed widely and the message sent across to the         entire Muslim society.
         • Will the society really wake up?
         It will take some time, and the media will have to help helpless women         like me. More women should come out and fight this gross injustice. There         is a need to challenge the male chauvinistic interpretation of Islam.         Things are changing even in Pakistan. One cannot marry a second time unless         a court of law permits. I am sure one day the whole picture of divorce         will change all over India. Simultaneously, society will soon recognise         that polygamy is the worst kind of barbarism faced particularly by Muslim         women of this country.
         • Have you read the Quran?
         Yes, of course. I have not only read and re-read it, but have also gone         through several different versions in English. The Quran does not permit         a man to have four wives just for the heck of it. The Muslim Personal         Law is also male-biased.



Initially, the judicial magistrate dismissed her appeal and granted an unbelievable Rs 75 per month maintenance to the child. But the sessions court soon observed that when the wife has challenged a divorce, it becomes incumbent on the husband to prove his divorce with cogent evidence.

Iqbal then went to the Gauhati High Court, which dismissed his plea, upheld the sessions court order and directed him to pay interim maintenance of Rs 500 per month to the child.

In the meantime, the family court was constituted in Guwahati and the case moved there. When the family court held the divorce effective, Zeenat returned to the high court, which granted a stay on the order.

It was around this time that Zeenat heard Iqbal was planning a second marriage. She filed another case, to try and stop him, but ignoring a notice served in September 1992, Iqbal solemnised the second marriage the same month.

On March 5, 1993, the Gauhati High Court finally ruled that a Muslim husband cannot divorce his wife on his whims and caprice and that a divorce must be preceded by pre-divorce counselling to arrive at a settlement. The HC remanded the matter to the family court for disposal. Iqbal then went to to the Supreme Court, which finally passed an order on August 14 this year upholding the high court order.

In fighting the case, Zeenat proved that her husband had forged the talaqnama (divorce document) in collusion with the qazi (priest), and that it was never communicated to her nor exhibited in court ‘‘as it was made after receipt of a notice from court’’ while Iqbal was trying to evade giving genuine maintenance to her.

The case of bigamy however still remains to be settled. Says Zeenat: ‘‘There is no validity of this second marriage as I haven’t been divorced…I wonder how an educated person, who is also a government employee, could go for a second marriage even as a case against triple talaq was on in the court of law.’’

Hailed locally as a hero and activist, Zeenat also writes an occasional piece in local newspapers on women’s rights and exploitation. But she doesn’t see herself in the roles society now attributes to her. ‘‘I am not a crusader or an activist,’’ she says. ‘‘I have fought a genuine case against triple talaq that has been imposed on Muslim women by a male chauvinist society by misinterpreting the Quran and age-old Shariat laws. I have thoroughly read the Quran and have not found one instance where triple talaq can be pronounced so easily.’’"
"1617716901-1","https://indianexpress.com/page/125/?s=Triple+talaq","Muslim women target talaq as malaise no 1","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/muslim-women-target-talaq-as-malaise-no-1/","Muslim women target talaq as malaise no 1","June 8, 1999","MUMBAI, JUNE 7: Fifty years after Independence, Muslim women have finally found their voice and have demanded that the greatest malaise in their community – the triple talaq system wherein a husband can divorce his wife, unilaterally, by simply mentioning `talaq’ thrice – be banned. They have also demanded a compulsory registration of marraiges and divorces. Stopping short of calling for a complete rehaul of the Muslim Personal Law the women have termed these demands as `reforms within the Personal Law’.
The demands were drawn up following a three day long national conference on `Muslim Personal Law and Women’, organised by Awaz-E-Niswan, in the sun kissed shores of INS Hamla, Malad last week. “All women, irrespective of the organisations they represented were unanimous that triple talaq has to be banned,” said Haseena Khan, president of the organisation at a press conference today. It is apparantly a breakthrough in the Muslim women’s movement. Said Razia Patel, a 1993 Times Fellowship scholar on Muslimwomen’s movement, “I have been in the field for the past 20 years and we could not even dream of articulating such demands back then”.
Around 200 women from 43 organisations working in the length and breadth of the country had gathered at the conference where it was felt that the right to maintenance of the divorced Muslim woman, snatched away following the Shah Bano case, should be returned to the woman and she be allowed to claim maintenance under section 125 of the CrPC (Code for Criminal Procedure).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The demands laid down by the women also include that both women and men should have equal rights in cases of divorce, the mehr (dower- paid by the husband to the wife) should be paid at the time of the marraige and not be deferred, and in case the mehr is deferred, value addition should be built into the system.
“While Muslim marraiges, which is the only community to recognise marraige as a social contract, has the `nikahnama’ during marraige, these need to be registered since many a times the wifedoes not have a copy of the nikahnama,” said Khan. This created problems when wives approach the police to file cases of harassment under section 498 and the husband claims she is not his wife. “Even after death, it is difficult for the wife to get her husband’s dues since she has no proof of marraige, ” said Khan. Regarding the notorious misuse of talaq, Khan also insisted that divorce should be registered. “By this, at least the second wife is not unaware that the man had been married earlier”.
The conference also drew up a demand for “kharch-e-paandaan’ or pin money that should compulsorily be given to the wife by the husband. When pointed out that none of the other communities had any such clause in their personal laws, Patel said that they were trying to use the law to provide for some money to the wives.
Claiming that it was the government’s responsibility to return the right to maintenance of the Muslim woman, Khan added that the Union government should constitute a board to help Muslim womenget their dues. In order to cut down the lengthy judicial procedure to be followed, Khan said that such a board could be based on the existing family courts.
The other important demand was that a mother should be given guardianship rights over her children. “There are times when the mother gets the custody of the child. She may not get any maintenance from the husband. But the father is the guardian who decides where the child should study, what career he should pursue etc,” said Khan.
A lot of other reforms however remained to be implemented. Like the right of a woman to her matrimonial house after divorce, education for women and their economic and educational empowerment. “These will require a mass movement, which was given a beginning at the conference,” said Patel, “and there will be a campaign at the grassroots by these organisations that attended it”. Aware that one needed political backing for such demands, Patel said that these demands will be put before political parties prior to theelections so that the women could work as pressure groups. “In the end, many of these reforms are a factor of the existing relations between the majority and minority communities in the state,” she pointed out."

The incident has shocked women rights activists who feel this could be a precedent-setting verdict.
The prosecution had charged Abdullah, an employee of a software company, and resident of Periyar Nagar with enticing and raping Mumtaj when she was alone in her house on November 22, 2004. Mumtaj’s sister who entered the house at that time was shocked to witness the sexual assault. Later, the victim’s parents lodged a complaint with the Periyar Nagar police station and a case was registered against Abdullah under Sections 417 and 376(1) of the IPC.
The case then came up for hearing before the Mahila Court, situated on the campus of the Madras High Court, where the prosecution pressed the charges against the accused. On May 30, arguments concluded and the presiding judge R Mohandas reserved judgment in the case.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, on June 20 when the judge was preparing to deliver the verdict in the case, the defence counsel submitted that in the intervening period the accused had married the victim after striking a compromise with Mumtaj’s family. The counsel produced the marriage certificate to prove that the accused and victim were man and wife. He pleaded for dropping of rape charges against the accused.
Following this the judge accepted the prayer and acquitted Abdullah.
‘‘This is a shocking case. Since the accused and the victim are followers of Islam at a later date he could simply utter the Triple Talaq and divorce the victim. The prosecution should appeal against the verdict in the interest of justice,’’ a leading women rights activist said.

The need of the hour, said Shaista Amber of the All India Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board, is to give statutory backing to Muslim marriage laws to prevent selective interpretation of holy texts based on convenience.
Muslim women’s organisations have said that banning triple talaq is not against Sharia law because the Quran does not have such a provision.
Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan said, “As far as the Quran is concerned, there is no mention of triple talaq. It is a later addition. After the passing away of the Prophet, one of the imams allowed it only temporarily. The right to divorce is given equally to both parties… There is a 90-day period for reconciliation and deliberation. Our primary argument in the Supreme Court is that it is not against the Shariat.”

“It is high time that all opposition parties come together on one platform to save democracy by stopping the NDA’s juggernaut,” Anwar, a Lok Sabha MP, said.
The BJP’s thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls as well as in MCD election in Delhi would not have been possible without division of votes of opposition parties, he said, adding the opposition needs to close ranks to form a grand alliance at the national stage to stop the BJP’s surge in national politics.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He, however, ruled out the merger of the NCP with the Congress saying that such a proposal was “not on the table” though his party was open to joining a grand alliance against the NDA at the national stage.
On the raging debate over the triple talaq issue, Anwar accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of raising it from time to time to deflect attention from other pressing matters.
“The triple talaq issue is sub-judice and yet the PM keeps raking it up from time to time to divert attention from real issues,” the NCP leader said.

Veteran scriptwriter Salim Khan on Monday criticised the practice of Triple Talaq by Muslim men saying it is against Quranic principle. The writer took to twitter to express his view on the raging debate over abolition of Triple Talaq, as demanded by many Muslim women.
“Triple Taalaaq arbitrarily in one sitting is against the Quranic principle. UCC is facing resistance from some clerics and might have been misunderstood by some muslims but, it does not interfere with Islam at all,” tweeted Khan.

The controversy arose after the Law Commission recently sought feedback from the public on whether the practice of triple talaq should be abolished and whether a uniform civil code be made optional.
A passionate debate has emerged over the government’s stand to oppose the practice of “triple talaq” with some leading women politicians seeking its abolition, even as Muslim bodies accused the ruling dispensation of waging a “war” on their personal law.
Though most of the women leaders avoided direct comments on the Centres affidavit or sought to dissect it, they were strongly critical of the prevalent practice of dissolving marriage through triple talaq."

Ramon Magsaysay award winner T M Krishna on Saturday said cultural authoritarianism was far more powerful than economic power and what was happening in Bollywood now was another example of that power. He was replying to a query on the development in Bollywood in the wake of a threat by MNS to Hindi film “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”, during an interaction at the Kovalam Literary Festival in Thiruvananthapuram.

“I think what is happening today in so called Bollywood is another example of that power. You will have all the money in the world. But if certain cultural oppression is practised, that has greater pressure and impact than all the money you have,” Krishna said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Karan Johar’s “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”, slated for Diwali release on October 28, had been embroiled in controversy over the past few weeks after MNS opposed the screening of movies featuring Pakistani actors after the Uri terror attack.
Earlier in the day, the decks were cleared for its release after Karan Johar and Producers’ Guild President Mukesh Bhatt met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and assured him that filmmakers would not work with Pakistani artistes, given the people’s sentiments in India post the Uri attack.
Asked about the controversy surrounding triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code, Krishna sought to know whether they had been mooted with the right intention. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board had taken a stand to oppose the Centre’s affidavit, which said the practise of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims needed a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
AIMPLB and other Muslim bodies had said they would boycott the Law Commission’s proceedings in the matter and had accused the Modi government of waging a “war” against their personal laws. They also said a Uniform Civil Code would “kill” India’s pluralism.
Krishna said the the biggest tragedy of the country was that “we have surrendered, gifted politics to politicians”. Another important thing was loss of the Left, resulting in weakening of progressive movement in the country, he noted.
“When I say Left…not as a political party. But the idea of Left. I think that is one of the biggest reasons why the progressive movement that allowed diverse conversion, disagreement and everything has died down,” he said.
“I think if Left wakes up….then we will have an interesting discourse. Artists will say different things and if that does not happen, we will have a problem.”"

(Source: Illustration by C R Sasikumar)
In Islam, ‘halala’ is a term that finds its roots in ‘halal’ that translates to something that is permissible, and therefore ‘lawful’. In context of marriage then, it means that a divorced woman can become ‘halal’ (lawful) for her husband again after nikah halala is complete.
Islam dictates that a Muslim man has the liberty to divorce and remarry the same woman twice. However, if he decides to dissolve the marriage for the third time, he can only remarry the same woman if she first marries another man, consummates the marriage, and only if the man dies or willingly asks for divorce, can the woman go back to her first husband and remarry him.
Indian Muslim jurist Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi (1863-1943) explained the concept clearly in Bahishti Zewar (a comprehensive handbook of Islamic beliefs and practices) that, “A person pronounces a revocable (raji) talaq. He then reconciles and resumes cohabitation. Two or four years later, under provocation he once again pronounces a revocable talaq. On recovering from provocation, he again resumes cohabitation. Now two talaqs are over. Hereafter, whenever he pronounces a talaq, it will be counted as the third talaq, which will dissolve the marriage forthwith, and should a remarriage be desired by the parties necessitate halala (inter-mediatory marriage).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the pronouncement of talaq, the woman becomes ‘haram’ (unlawful and therefore, prohibited) for the husband.
In context of divorce, a bar was laid down in order to ensure that the man did not use it as a tool for torturing his wife (by marrying and divorcing her as many times as he desired). It was the rule of irrevocability. This rule was introduced to maintain strict discipline and to ensure that marriage was not reduced to mere mockery.
It is said that this rule was established by the Prophet himself. Dr. Furqan Ahmad, a Research Associate at the Indian Law Institute wrote in Understanding the Islamic Law of Divorce that “the Prophet tried to put an end to [this] barbarous pre-Islamic practice” which was “to divorce wife and take her back several times in order to ill-treat her”. The Prophet, by the rule of irrevocability of the third pronouncement, indicated clearly that such a practice could not be continued indefinitely. Thus, if the husband really wished to take the wife back, he should do so; if not, the third pronouncement after two reconciliations would operate as a final bar.”
Jurist Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi further explained in Bahishti Zewar that if the husband and wife wanted to re-marry for the third time, it could be done only on one condition: the woman had to marry another man and sleep with him. “Now, if the second husband dies or divorces her after sexual intercourse,” wrote Thanvi, “then after completing the Iddat period, she can re-marry the first husband. But, if the second husband died or divorced her before sexual intercourse, then it will be of no account and she cannot marry the first husband in such condition.”
This law, followed by a small part of the Muslim community, is called Nikah Halala.
In India, personal laws pertaining to divorce and marriage are anchored in religion. Triple talaq (where a man can divorce his wife by saying “talaq, talaq, talaq”) is a grave, contentious issue, where the central government feels Muslim women should push back. At the rally in Uttar Pradesh in 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said such laws denied Muslim women their fundamental right. “The lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be ruined by triple talaq,” he said. In the midst of this, the government is also pushing the Supreme Court to obliterate nikah halala and polygamy in India. But many Islamic authorities and religious leaders believe BJP’s drive to abolish triple talaq in India is a political ploy.
Defending its hidebound religious laws, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has said before that any deviation from such Quranic injunction (validity of triple talaq) would go against the mandate of the Almighty himself. “Such an act would be going against the very integral practice of Islam, and would be disregarding the precise directions of Allah and also his Messenger which is nothing but a sin,” the body has been quoted as saying.
Nikah halala is a law that requires a woman to marry and sleep with another man in order to return to her first husband. There have been instances where the husband regrets divorcing his wife through triple talaq and in the hope of reconciliation, hands over his divorced wife to another man for marriage, under the condition that the latter would divorce the woman the next day. Muta (conditional marriage), however, is considered to be a sin in Islam and the Sharia law does not permit it. The husband is therefore considered a sinner. The second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Umar (579-644 AD) considered such husbands to be sinners and said, “I will stone to death such persons”.
In modern India, nikah halala has been manipulated and misused. In October 2016, an Indian Muslim woman claimed that her husband’s friend raped her. The husband had lost his wife to his friend in a gambling game, and therefore had to divorce her. In order to get her back, the husband asked his friend to sleep with the woman. The accused (husband’s friend) called it part of the “nikah halala”, so that her divorced husband could take her back.
In the midst of this, several websites and social media pages have emerged offering halala marriage services to women who’ve been divorced by their first husbands. For instance, a twitter page called Halal Nikah reads, “Assalamu’alaykum Alhmadulillah, this is a marriage service for muslims worldwide. take an advantage of it now.”
Such sites offer men who are willing to marry and sleep with the client (in this case, a distraught and divorced woman) in exchange for a fee. Many women who approach these services are either blackmailed or taken advantage of. Many are asked to pay large sums of money. In 2016, a BBC reporter went undercover, posing as a divorced Muslim woman who was seeking a halala marriage service through facebook. The reporter was asked to pay a sum of £2,500, for a bogus, temporary marriage where the man on the facebook page offered to marry and sleep with her.
In patriarchal societies, religious laws have often been lopsided, favouring men. Laws such as triple talaq and nikah halala are not only archaic, but they are also debilitating for Muslim women. The legality of such laws need to be challenged and subsequently, discarded."

(Source: Express Photo by Pramod Adhikari)
Opposing the rigid approach of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) to Islamic marriage laws, the All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) has suggested the adoption of a “modern nikahnama”, seeking changes in the terms and conditions of marriage under Islamic law.
AISPLB spokesperson Maulana Yasoob Abbas, who submitted a draft of the nikahnama (pre-nuptial agreement) to eminent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, vice-president of AIMPLB, said he has suggested invalidating the instantaneous triple talaq, and provide women with the right to divorce.
He said he had also written to AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani a few days back, suggesting the changes. Abbas said the stand taken by the AIMPLB in the Supreme Court has “defamed the religion of Islam”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On September 2, the AIMPLB had told the Supreme Court, which is hearing a PIL by a Muslim woman against the practice of triple talaq, that the scrapping of instantaneous talaq will increase the possibility of husbands killing their estranged wives. It also defended the practice of polygamy.
Abbas said the AISPLB will also put their views before the SC in the coming days. He said they have tried to address the issues related to dowry and inadequate mehr given to brides at the time of marriage.
He said the triple talaq is not valid, and the divorce must take place in front of witnesses. In his draft nikahnama, he has also made a provision for providing maintenance to a divorced wife if she has no other means to sustain herself.
It also says that a woman will be able to divorce her husband if he disappears for two years and does not provide her with essentials. As per its draft, the woman will also have the power to divorce her husband if he physically assaults her, causing danger to her life or limbs.
The draft also says that the concerned parties can go to court the arbitration under Islamic law fails in cases of divorce. Abbas said Maulana Sadiq discussed the changes in nikahnama with him for about an hour and assured that he will put it for discussion before the executive of AIMPLB in its next meeting."

Amid raging debate over verbal triple talaq, a top Muslim cleric on Saturday attributed the increasing confusion over Sharia laws, especially those related to women, to the lack of adequate information and implementation of these laws.
All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali said majority of the women were satisfied with Sharia and there was no need to amend these laws.
Islami Sharia was not meant to change with time and situation, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Mahali said problems were cropping up as Muslims were not following the laws properly.
[related-post]
“Any change in Sharia will not be tolerated. It is the responsibility of female members of the Board to take Islami Sharia to women,” he said.
The AIMPLB member said the issue of triple talaq was being raked up because of lack of information among Muslim women about rights given to them in Islam.
“No other religion provides so much rights to women like Islam. On certain issues, women have more rights than men and 99 per cent Muslim women were happy with the law,” he said.
“Sharia does not do injustice to anyone. In Islam marriage is an agreement, which is solemnised with the will of both the parties,” Mahali said.
Regarding triple talaq, the cleric said that giving triple talaq at one go was wrong and they condemn it.
After recent court orders a fresh debate has started on women’s right in Sharia.
His statement assumes significance as All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board had said earlier said that Sharia law would not work in India and it could only be followed in Islamic countries.
Held under the aegis of AIMPLB, a conference was organised in Lucknow on Saturday to address issues related to women’s rights in the light of Muslim Personal Law.
A woman member Asma Zehra from Hyderabad said Muslim Personal Law is formulated in the light of Quran and Hadith (sayings and deeds of the Prophet).
She said that Islam was first to give equal and in some cases more rights to woman than men, example being the consent to accept in nikah which is first given by the girl/bride.
Similarly, just as a man can annul the marriage by saying Talaq, the woman also has the same right to exercise it through ‘Khulaa’ or Faskh e Nikah (right of a woman to seek a divorce from her husband).
Citing verses from Quran, she said it was not legal or justified for a husband and wife to live together after a man has said talaq thrice.
Zehra said India is a secular, democratic country and all citizens have the right to religious freedom.
Media was highlighting the issue of triple talaq to show that huge number of Muslim women were suffering because of this provision but the ground reality is that the divorce rate is least in the Muslim community, she said.
She said “letter head organisation” have presented false concocted data in their survey reports. “We strongly condemn such surveys. Muslim Personal Law is a Divine Law. There is no scope for any change or amendment.”
The Muslim Personal Law is attacked for being gender biased and anti woman which is totally false and untrue, she said."

ARIBA IMTIAZ, the youngest daughter of Imtiaz and Safiya Shaikh, has spent a chunk of her life navigating the grimy lanes of Kasaibada, a butcher’s colony in Mumbai’s Kurla, to ensure she reached college on time. Her parents were forced to move into this ghetto from Nehru Nagar, also in Kurla, after facing threats during the 1992 communal riots following the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya.
Today, Ariba is a dentist. But she wants to do more, she wants to achieve her dream of entering the civil services before getting married. In many ways, this 24-year-old represents the fraught but palpable change that is underway in the lives of Muslim women in India. With the popular narrative about Muslim women largely revolving around the Burkha and Triple Talaq, Ariba and lakhs of women like her symbolise the concerted drive by Muslim women to reclaim their space within the community and the country by using education as a tool.

According to Census data available since 2001, the number of Muslim female graduates has grown at an astounding rate of 168 per cent (see box). The national average growth during the same period — 2001 to 2011 — was lower at 115 per cent. This trend is ratified by figures made available by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which shows that the growth in attendance rates in educational institutions per 1,000 persons in the age group 0-29 for major religious groups is highest for Muslim females. Significantly, this was more than the national rate in urban and rural India.

“There is a rising desire among Indian Muslims for education. I have come across many cases where the male child of a family has dropped out and started working, while the family facilitates the education of the girl child,” says Dr Abdul Shaban, deputy director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “However, the benefit of this education in social terms can only be felt over a larger period of time.
For instance, even now, not enough educated Muslim women are getting jobs in the organised sector,” says Shaban, who is also a member of a commission set up by the Telangana government to study the socio-economic and educational status of Muslims. NSSO data shows that Shaban’s assertion is tied to the general fall of women in the Labour Force Participation Rate (see box above). Interestingly, even educated Muslim women, who are part of the workforce, are increasingly finding it difficult to get jobs.
“Without a broad range of empowerment initiatives, Muslim women will be unable to address their vulnerability. Unless critical masses of Muslim women are mobile and able to independently access state machinery, they will not be able to seek redress for the development deficit facing them,” states a report by Dr Amitabh Kundu, who headed the Post Sachar Evaluation Committee. Data shows that this gap may have forced many Muslim women to opt for self-employment. NSSO figures show a 10 per cent fall in self-employed women in urban India but an 85 per cent increase among Muslim women.
This growing confidence can also be gauged from the fact that the proportional share of households headed by females is higher among Muslims than the national average. The government defines ‘Head of the household’ as one who manages its affairs and takes decisions, as acknowledged by others in the house. However, there is no denying the fact that Muslim women remain the most vulnerable and susceptible social group when it comes to divorce. The divorce rate for Muslim women is 5.63 for every 1,000 married women, while the national rate is 3.10.
In this group, Muslim women between 20 and 34 account for nearly 44 per cent of the total 2.12 lakh Muslim women divorcees. This age group makes up only 24 per cent of the total Muslim female population in India. At the same time, data shows, there seems to be some course correction from within the community on divorce and separation. While the total number of divorced and separated women grew by 40.13 per cent, from 23.42 lakh to 32.82 lakh between 2001 and 2011, the growth was marginally less at 39 per cent for Muslim women, from 3.59 lakh to 4.99 lakh.

Interestingly, there also appears to be an increasing assertion by young Muslim women on decisions of marriage and the choice of having children. According to 2011 Census figures, among Indian women between the age of 20-39, the number of those who have remained unmarried has been the highest among Muslims — a 94 per cent increase from 2001. Data also shows a rise among Muslim married women between the age of 20 to 39 who do not have or have opted not to have children — a 39 per cent increase.
“Things are slowly changing on the ground. The trend may not be so obvious in rural areas. But as urban Muslim women become more empowered, they are taking time to plan their families,” says Rubina Feroz, general secretary, Ishterak Education Society, and member of the Association of Muslim Professionals.
Says Ariba, the dentist from Kasaibada, “There is a growing realisation that you need to take charge of your life. Some of it stems from a sense of victimisation you feel as a member of a minority within a minority. Some of it comes from the fear that you may be discriminated. However, if you are part of the bigger, broader world with your fundamentals in place, it gets very difficult for people to bully or mess with you.”"

She had come with her two young daughters, Amina and Aziza. The speakers had impressed upon the participants that under our Constitution women had equal rights with men. 
The participants were then asked if they had any questions. Ayesha told us that her husband had given her a triple talaq and was living with two more wives. How is polygamy permitted among Muslims when it is forbidden for Hindus, Christians and every other community? 
Why is there a one-sided triple talaq when every one else has to go to court? But, we said, even in Islam nobody could marry again except with the consent of his first wife and only when he was in a position to treat them equally. Ayesha replied that her husband Mohammad never asked for her consent before remarrying. I told her that both polygamy and triple talaq have been abolished or severely restricted in many Islamic countries. ‘‘Then why do we not do the same thing in our country?’’ she asked. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Participating in the debate in the Constituent Assembly on Article 44 K.M. Munshi asserted ‘‘Look at the Hindu Law; you get any amount of discrimination against women; and if that is part of Hindu religion or Hindu religious practice, you cannot pass a single law which would elevate the position of Hindu women to that of men’’. This was on November 23, 1948.
Manu said that if a man does not repay his father’s debts, he will be born as a dog, slave or a woman. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution the Hindu Law needed as much reform, if not more, as the Muslim Law. The Hindu Code drafted by the B.N. Rau Committee faced the same opposition as we see today against the Women’s Reservation Bill. It was Ambedkar’s dream to abolish untouchability and remove all discrimination against women.
The main object of Article 44 was to reform all personal laws, particularly to uplift the lot of women. The widespread impression that it was only in regard to Muslim Law or religious minorities is erroneous and convenient.
Hindu Law was partially reformed by splitting the Hindu Code Bill into several acts like the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act 1956, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 and Hindu Succession Act 1956. Polygamy was abolished. 
Marrying a second wife during the lifetime of the first cannot be considered an integral part of any religion. It must not be forgotten that down the years, most of the inequalities that Christian and Parsi women suffer have also been removed.
In Hindu Law, the aberration is now only in the field of joint Hindu family property. Five states — Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka — have inducted unmarried daughters as co-parceners in a joint Hindu family property through legislation, bestowing both ownership and the right to partition the joint family property to them. Kerala has gone a step further and has abolished the concept of co-parcenary and the joint Hindu family property. 
In Kerala, Nairs and Nambiars who constitute about a fifth of the population, have a matriarchal society with matrilineal inheritance. The draft Bill proposed by the Law Commission of India under the chairmanship of Justice Jeevan Reddy in 2000 for making women co-parceners in Hindu joint family property throughout the country is yet to become law.
It is not as if there is no Uniform Civil Code in India. The Portuguese Civil Code in Goa continues. Both partners have a communion of property but on dissolution the property has to be divided equally. Sons and daughters have equal right on the property. All marriages, of Hindus, Muslims or Christians, have to be registered before the civil registrar. Bigamy is an offence and one man-one woman is the rule.
The courts have consistently directed the legislature to enact a Uniform Civil Code. Our courts have unfortunately taken the view that personal law is not included in Article 13 of Part III of the Constitution. This has resulted in making human rights ineffective vis a vis a large area of discriminatory practices against women. The need of the hour is for the Supreme Court to advise the nation that holding personal laws which are in conflict with human rights are void under Article 13.
Women’s rights as declared by the Beijing Declaration are human rights. Let us do away with all discriminatory practices and laws against women, irrespective of religion.
In substance, the heart and object of Article 44 is the empowerment of women and gender parity and justice. No longer can our women, regardless of their religion, be denied their freedom to choose and their right to excel."

(representative image)
The All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) supported the demand of Muslim women for the abolition of the instant arbitrary triple talaq on Friday in a statement issued by AIDWA president Malini Bhattacharya. The statement says AIDWA strongly disapproves of the retrograde position taken by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in this regard in its petition to the Supreme Court, and that the Board’s position has nothing to do with religious beliefs as most Muslim countries do not have this obnoxious practice of instant and arbitrary divorce.

AIDWA condemned the efforts of the Modi Government through statements by ministers to bring in the issue of a Uniform Civil Code. They said the questionnaire issued by the Law Commission on Uniform Civil Code just at this point of time that has government backing is a great disservice to reformers within the community who are committed to reform in personal law but are against UCC.Pune NewsRailways moots use of automated scavenging mini truck to keep tracks cleanFire breaks out at gas pipeline in Pune’s Ambegaon Khurd area, brought under control swiftlyPune: Industries trying to set up Covid vaccination camps on their premisesClick here for more
Instead of sermonising and communalising issues concerning women’s rights, the government should urgently come up with a law against honour-killing which is being opposed by caste-based khap panchayats, the statement added. It also stated the government is not bringing reforms to ensure that unequal and unjust provisions in Hindu laws are done away with, and laws related to succession in property and land or those related to guardianship of children continue to discriminate against women. Women in India still do not have a right in marital property, said the statement."

Government has asked the Law Commission to examine the issue of Uniform Civil Code, an issue that is dear to BJP and the sangh parivar. The Department of Legal Affairs has asked the Commission, a recommendatory body, to submit a report on the issue.
The move assumes significance as the Supreme Court had recently said it would prefer a wider debate, in public as well as in court, before taking a decision on the constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, which many complain is abused by Muslim men to arbitrarily divorce their wives.
[related-post]
Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda had earlier said that the issue could be referred to the Law Commission for examination. Gowda had said “wider consultations” will be held with various personal law boards and other stakeholders to evolve a consensus and the process may take some time.

“…Even the Preamble of our Constitution and Article 44 of the Constitution do say that there should be a Uniform Civil Code…it needs to have a wider consultation,” he had said. A decision “cannot be done in a day or two. It will take its own time”, Gowda had said. Implementation of a common civil code is part of the BJP’s election manifesto. But the NDA, when it came to power in 1998 and 1999 and now under Narendra Modi, had kept contentious issues, including the UCC, on the backburner."

With the Narendra Modi government facing flak over its stand on triple talaq, BJP President Amit Shah today asked the partymen to make respect of women, besides development, an issue in the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Flagging off the third ‘Parivartan yatra’ from here, Shah said “There is another question to which people of Uttar Pradesh will have to give their verdict (in the coming Assembly polls).
“Should women in the country not get equal rights? SP, BSP and Congress will not speak on (triple talaq) but we do not have any fear. I want to say from this platform that in the coming polls, besides development and eradication of goondas, respect of women should be made a poll issue,” Shah said
He also asked the three parties to submit their affidavit on whether they back ‘triple talaq’ or not. Asking whether the Centre’s stand before the Supreme Court upholding the dignity and honour of the women and doing away with the triple talaq should have been taken or not, Shah said every single party worker will make women aware that Modi government is committed for their development, honour and rights.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Slamming Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Shah alleged that with his stand on the surgical strike, he has made a mockery of the bravery and sacrifice of army jawans.
“People of the country are proud of the army and the will power of Narendra Modi for carrying out surgical strikes in Pakistani soil and saving the borders,” he added."

The Kerala High Court on Friday observed that the apprehension that a uniform civil code governing marriage will offend the Sharia is a myth and underlined the need for a codified law for divorce.
Justice Muhamed Mustaque made the observation while hearing four petitions related to the divorce of Muslims. In one petition, a man had challenged a lower court order that asked him to pay alimony to his wife whom he had divorced through triple talaq. In three other pleas, the petitioners approached the court, saying that the passport office had not accepted their request to change the spouse’s name after they divorced through triple talaq. The first petition was dismissed, while the court asked the passport office to consider the plea of the other three petitioners.

“Apprehension of uniform civil code on marriage, that it will offend Sharia law, is a myth. The uniform civil code presupposes liberal multi-cultural society wherein one or more groups cannot hold unjustifiable consideration over others,” Justice Mustaque said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The court said the law governing marriage, especially divorce, needs homogeneity for sustenance of marriage as a social institution. “The state must strive to achieve meaningful action to sustain equilibrium towards national oneness in character of society, while giving freedom to keep different faith holders to identify themselves in individual and social life without limiting their right to remain as group,” the court observed.
The court said the State is being alerted that justice has become elusive to Muslim women and the remedy lies in codification of the divorce law.
“The law is required to be aligned with justice … It is for the law makers to correlate law and social phenomena relating to divorce through the process of legislation to advance justice in institutionalised form. It is imperative that to advance justice, law must be formulated without any repugnance to the religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India. It is for the State to consider the formulation of codified law to govern the matter,’’ said the judge."

Shayara hasn’t met her two children since she left Allahabad last April. (Express Photo by Ravi Kanojia)
The photograph of the bride in her wedding finery, her kohl-rimmed hazel eyes peering into the camera, bears little resemblance to Shayara Banu of today. The wedding album titled ‘Romantic Moments’ also features photographs of a two-wheeler, household furniture, utensils and jewellery that were given away at the time of the wedding.
Next to the album is a polythene bag with medicines for the “infections” Banu claims to have caught from multiple abortions and a heavy dose of anti-depressants. For the last 15 years of her marriage, she says, her greatest dread has been the word talaq being uttered thrice by her husband Rizwan Ahmed. Last year in October, while she was at her parents’ home in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur district, her fears came true: Rizwan sent her the talaq-nama from Allahabad.
On the advice of her family, the 35-year-old is using her case as a plank to challenge the triad of instantaneous triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and halala (a practice where divorced women, in case they want to go back to their husbands, have to consummate a second marriage). Her petition in the Supreme Court makes no mention of the contentious Uniform Civil Code, neither does it ask for codification of the Muslim personal law. She has sought equality before law and protection against discrimination on the basis of her gender and religion.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Soon after the wedding, they started demanding a four-wheeler and more money. But that wasn’t the only problem. From the very beginning, my husband would threaten to give me talaq each time he found some fault with me. For the first two years of marriage, when I didn’t bear a child, my mother-in-law would egg him on to divorce me,” says Shayara, who is today mother to a 14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, both of whom are away from her, in her husband’s custody.
Shayara says that a year after her marriage to Rizwan, a property dealer based in Allahabad, UP, she wasn’t allowed to attend her sister’s wedding in the same city. In the last 14 years, she says, she wasn’t allowed to visit her sister, who lives within a half-hour distance from her house in Allahabad.
She lost count of the number of abortions she was forced to undergo by Rizwan. “Six or seven times maybe. I would often plead with him to allow me to undergo tubectomy, but he wouldn’t relent,” she says.
Her mother Feroza Begum says the emotional and physical battering turned Shayara into a bundle of nerves. Until last year, she says, her daughter never uttered a word about her agony, not even about how he allegedly tried to throttle her once. “Dimaag kharab ho gaya tha Shayara ka tension le le kar. Yahan aakar hamne ilaaj karaya (Shayara had lost her mind with all that stress. We got her treated after she came here),” says Feroza.
Last year in April, when her condition deteriorated, Shayara says Rizwan asked her to pack a small bag and asked her father to meet them half-way in Moradabad, from where he could take her home. She was told that she could return once she recovered entirely. “As I regained my health slowly, I would call him and ask him to come take me back but he didn’t want me to come and wouldn’t let me speak with my children either,” she says. She waited restlessly for six months, and it was then that the talaq-nama came.
Rizwan denies having ever beaten Shayara, though he admits to keeping her away from her relatives as he “didn’t want anything to do with them”. He also admits to the multiple abortions. Vasectomy and tubectomy, he says, are considered to be “bahut haram”. “I have given her talaq the way Shariat and Hadith allow me to. I cannot take her back now, it will be against the Shariat. It is not good to go against what the religion has prescribed,” says Rizwan over the phone from Allahabad.

For over three decades now, the tiny Army quarter at the cantonment of RTSD-Hempur (Remount Training School and Depot) in Kashipur tehsil has been home to Iqbal, an accountant in the Army, and his family: wife, three daughters, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Today, in this cantonment, his daughter Shayara is insulated from censure that would otherwise have come her way for taking on the practices in her community. “I grew up in Allahabad where I have seen women around me being subjected to this, but they were all too poor to go to court. When my daughter fell in the same trap, I decided it was time to do something,” he says.
The family first met Supreme Court advocate Balaji Srinivasan for inter-state transfer of a case filed by Rizwan at the Allahabad family court. “In the meantime, her husband sent her the talaq-nama by post, which then became the basis of her writ petition,” says Srinivasan.
In her petition, she has challenged ‘instantaneous triple talaq’ and not triple talaq itself, which is allowed by the Quran as long as the three utterances are spread over 90 days. There have been PILs filed by NGOs and individuals in the Supreme Court but, he says, those didn’t stand as they weren’t filed by an affected party or because they pleaded that Uniform Civil Code be introduced. Shayara’s is the first such case where a Muslim woman has challenged a personal practice citing fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
***
Outside the Army cantonment, Shayara’s case is yet to make news in the rest of Kashipur. The religious heads of the small town got wind of the case only recently after local newspapers approached them for their views on the matter.
About 14 km away from her house lives 65-year-old Ataur Rehman, the imam of the town for 25 years before he retired two years ago. Scattered across his room, that doubles up as a unani clinic, are vials of pills and medicines. Having just gotten off the Persian rug on which he takes his afternoon siesta, before his next batch of patients start streaming in, Rehman is still heavy-eyed. But in a resounding voice, he explains that the courts or the State have no business interfering in religious matters.
He says that the recommended way of giving talaq is for a Muslim man to utter it once, give the woman some time to mend her ways, utter it again, give her some more time, before making the third and final utterance. “However, even if it is uttered thrice in one go, it is valid. Kami auraton ki bhi hoti hai. Bina wajah koi aadmi talaq nahi deta (Women are also at fault. No man gives talaq without a reason),” he says.
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, allows Indian Muslims to be governed by the Shariat. The absence of codification has legally allowed community leaders to hold the practices as sacrosanct. The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, however, codifies a woman’s right to seek divorce by approaching the court.
Rehman believes that a woman’s right to khula only allows her to plead with her husband for divorce and doesn’t actually give her the right to divorce her husband. “I don’t care what the Act says, but if the woman is given the right to talaq, she won’t live with her man even for six months, she will leave. Women can’t have the right to give talaq, it’s without doubt a man’s prerogative.”
Polygamy, Rehman says, is allowed as long as the man can take care of all four wives equally and halala is required as it will ensure that the man “thinks twice before divorcing his wife”.

A post-graduate in sociology, Shayara, the eldest of four siblings, is the most educated in the family. “Mujhe samaj ke bare mein seekhna tha (I wanted to learn about society),” she says. Her ambition was to teach, which she did very briefly for a few months before she got married.
If the court rules in her favour, holding triple talaq to be null and void, she will be faced with taking a call on whether she wants to go back to Allahabad. “I might go back, for the sake of my children, that is, if he shows an inclination to change,” she says.
Her family, however, is more determined. Their objection is to the manner in which her husband divorced her and not to the divorce itself. Her mother says that if the apex court holds her triple talaq to be invalid, they will approach the court to seek divorce through the legal route. Her father says, “A person who has brought her to this state, kept her like a prisoner all these years, why go back to him? But I always leave it to my children to take the final call.”
On her part, Shayara’s low-pitched voice wavers throughout as she talks about her past or her uncertain future. The only time it takes on a resolute tone is when she talks about the present. “Shah Bano got a ruling in her favour from the Supreme Court but it was later overturned by the government, denying divorced Muslim women their right to maintenance. Had her case been a success, it would have been one battle less for us,” says Shayara.
TAGGED ON
* Thirty-ONE years after the SC urged the government in the Shah Bano case to frame a uniform civil code, a two-judge bench in October 2015 suo motu ordered registration of a PIL.
* Justices Anil R Dave and Adarsh K Goel sought responses from the Attorney General and the National Legal Services Authority of India on whether “gender discrimination” suffered by Muslim women should not be considered a violation of fundamental rights.
* The bench was hearing a matter related to succession when it said it is time to focus on rights of Muslim women. The judges asked for the case to be placed before the CJI to constitute a bench. It is now being heard with Shayara Bano case."

Promising to turn Uttar Pradesh into the richest state, BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday said it could be possible only if people dumped SP and BSP and ushered in a government run by the saffron party. “Enough of SP and BSP. You have given them enough chance. Now please dump these two parties and usher in a BJP government,” he said at a ‘parivartan rally’.

“I promise you that UP will become the richest state in the country once BJP comes to power. There will be no loot of public money, no scams, as have been taking place all these years under Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party,” he said.
Shah said Bundelkhand, of which Jhansi is a part, was rich in natural resources and once BJP came to power there would be no illegal mining in the area. With BJP-led government at the Centre, the state can progress by leaps and bounds if there is a government of the same party in UP as corruption will become a thing of the past, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Even (BSP supremo) Mayawati says Samajwadi Party is not good…so give chance to BSP. But friends, SP and BSP are the two sides of the same coin and can never deliver the goods,” he said. Shah said no one could expect better law and order in the state under SP or BSP rule.
“Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had said he would give up his chair if gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s party QED merged with SP. The merger has taken place. Why is he continuing as CM? What happened,” he asked.
Shah said SP was studded with tainted people like Afzal, Ateeq and Azam, while BSP had Nasimuddin in its fold.
“But, there are no goonda elements in BJP,” he said.
On the issue of “triple talaq”, he said BJP was for Uniform Civil Code and filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court opposing the practice. He asked Congress, SP and BSP to clarify their stand on the issue.
Earlier, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said goonda elements ruled the roost in UP where law and order had touched the nadir.
“Let BJP come to power in UP. This situation will change,” he said, adding BJP alone can give a corruption-free government.
Union ministers Kalraj Mishra and Uma Bharti and BJP vice president Om Mathur and state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya also addressed the gathering."

Shia Personal Law Board member Maulana Yasoob Abbas on Saturday met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. “We had a courtesy meeting with the Chief Minister but a delegation of the Board will soon meet him in connection with our demands,” Abbas said. The delegation will demand setting up a separate committee or commission on the lines of Sachar Committee for ensuring development and welfare of minority Shia among the Muslims, he said.
The Rajinder Sachar Committee was commissioned in 2005 by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to prepare a report on the latest social, economic and educational conditions of the Muslim community.
On being asked about his take on ‘triple talaq’, the Shia leader said the practice should be done away with.
Responding to the Ayodhya issue, Abbas said, “The Shias want that the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue should be resolved through mutual negotiations and the government should assist in this task.”"

Accusing the BJP and the Centre of tinkering with issues related to Shariat, she said such matters should be left to the Muslim community and not raked up with an eye on the upcoming Assembly elections in some states for political gains.

“BJP and its central government led by Narendra Modi has now started a new controversy over Muslim personal law, triple talaq and common civil code before the Assembly elections in some states to serve its petty politics. BSP strongly condemns it,” Mayawati said in a statement.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The prime minister and central government instead of interfering in the issue of triple talaq should better leave it to the Muslim community to form a common opinion,” she stressed. Modi had yesterday denounced the practice of triple talaq among Muslims and deprecated attempts to politicise the issue.
The BSP chief said it is not right for the prime minister to “force his opinion and decision on the believers of any particular religion by following the RSS agenda”.
“It is not in national interest that BJP and prime minister indulge in petty politics in the matters of Muslims and their Shariat, especially before the coming Assembly polls in some states,” she added."

BJP MP Rupa Ganguly on Friday said there should not be different laws for different communities residing in the country and strongly advocated introduction of a uniform civil code. She wondered if Trinamool Congress MPs, who are supporting triple talaq, had any idea about the kind of harassment the Muslim women endured on account of the antiquated practice. Ganguly lashed out at the TMC for supporting triple talaq and opposing uniform civil code.

“How can you have separate laws for separate communities? Those who are supporting triple talaq, do they have any idea about the kind of harassment the Muslim women suffer after being summarily divorced?” she asked a rally.
The famous actress, who had mesmerised India with her powerful portrayal of Draupadi in the mega-serial Mahabharat, pointed out that in several Muslim countries triple talaq had been banned.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC was supporting the triple talaq and uniform civil code in order to appease the Muslim Community of the state for the sake of vote bank politics.
“The TMC is supporting the issue because they are not interested in the upliftment of women in the country but want to pursue vote bank politics. They are not interested in education, health of Muslim community but in the sermons of the fundamentalists,” Ghosh said.
The BJP’s public rally opposing the triple talaq and supporting the UCC was staged when a three-day convention of All India Muslim Personal Law Board started from today."

(File Photo)
Having earned the credit for securing the minority vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, firebrand leader Yogi Adityanath’s ascension to the throne of the state came as no surprise. But considering his old remarks, which managed to give enough fodder to the opposing parties to attack him on the lines of ‘divisive politics,’ it set many tongues wagging in the political circles.
While many leaders dubbed this development path-breaking calling it a master-stroke on the saffron party’s part, some expressed doubt over appointing a staunch-Hindutva leader in a state that boasts of a sizeable proportion of Muslim population – a double-edged sword that could go either way for the BJP, especially when the saffron party is keeping an eye over 2019. But considering the past one month, Adityanath has managed to keep people surprised, happily at that, even his detractors.
Some of the highlights of his tenure-till now include :-
Crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses: The ban on legal as well as illegal abattoirs was one of the main agendas of the BJP manifesto in the recently concluded elections. And keeping his word, a day after he took charge as the chief minister, illegal slaughterhouses were sealed in Allahabad and other places across the state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Following this, several BJP-ruled states followed suit and banned illegal abattoirs, establishing agreement with Adityanath’s way of functioning.
Anti-romeo squads: A move that invited wrath of many, the establishment of the security groups inspired Haryana to set up their ‘Operation Durga’ in the state.
Farmer loans worth Rs. 36,359 crore waived: Adityanath gave a big relief to small and marginal farmers in the state by waiving off farmer loans worth Rs. 36,359 crore.
Crackdown on VIP culture: Adityanath urged all his ministerial colleagues to shun siren and hooters and red beacons atop vehicles.
18-hour continuous electricity to rural areas: Adityanath promised to ensure a continuous supply of electricity to rural areas in the state, that would extend up to 18 hours.
Adityanath’s recent remarks about triple talaq have also stirred a positive storm in the state. He had said that those remaining silent are equally responsible as those practising the age-old tradition.
Several Muslim clerics and the people, in general, have rallied behind their Chief Minister after the statement made news for all the right purposes.
In wake of this, Adityanath’s ascension to the throne of the state has moved sideways from under the scanner, especially of those who have been accusing the saffron party of playing along divisive lines.
The Chief Ministership, starting from today – when Adityanath completes a month of his appointment, can be a redemption of abdication, in a way that the Muslims can find a safe abode for them in the north of India.
A lot was at stake at Adityanath’s promotion, and a lot remains; more so in consideration with the 2019 General Elections that stand to decide the fate of the BJP in the country."

It states that only the Talaq-e-Ahsan method should be followed.
In a move aimed at improving the conditions of Muslim women across the country, the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) has finalised a draft Muslim family law which does away with oral divorce, polygamy and also stipulates the mehr amount paid to a woman at her wedding.
The draft law called the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, will be released on Wednesday.
For the past seven years, the BMMA has been working on the draft law in which for the first time Islamic laws pertaining to marriage, divorce and maintenance have been codified. The BMMA is hoping the government uses this draft law to improve the condition of Muslim women in the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The draft stipulates that the bride should at least be 18 years of age while the bridegroom should be at least 21 years of age and neither of the two should have a living spouse, thus ensuring that polygamy is stopped. The Islamic laws allow a Muslim man to have upto four wives.
The draft also states that the minimum amount of mehr, which is the paid by the groom to the bride during the wedding, shall not be less than one full annual income of the groom. It further states that if the stipulated mehr is not paid within six months of marriage, then the groom will have to pay double the amount. Presently some grooms give an amount as less as Rs 786 as mehr.
The draft law virtually abolishes oral divorce and triple talaq. It states that only the Talaq-e-Ahsan method should be followed.
In this method once the divorce is pronounced the couple waits for three months in what is seen as a period to sort out differences. This keeps the option of a reunion open and the husband can reverse the process of divorce if both parties agree.
The draft also imposes heavy penalty on offenders, including cancelling of a qazi’s licence for repeat offences in failing to ensure fulfilment of conditions during marriage. It also calls for action under the Criminal Procedure Code for all those who fail to pay maintenance.
Muslims in India are governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1936. This law makes the Shariat applicable on Muslims. However this law is not codified and is open to interpretations by local clergy. Various women’s groups have been demanding that the Muslim Personal Law should be codified so that its provisions are clear to everyone.
However, conservative clergy has claimed the codification is tantamount to tampering with the Shariat and the Islamic way of life. The state is also not very keen on taking up the issue for fear of antagonizing the clergy."

The second-biggest Urdu newspaper in Mumbai, Urdu Times, has taken on poet-scriptwriter Javed Akhtar, questioning his credibility in the protest against triple talaq.
Akhtar is the head of Muslims for Secular Democracy (MSD), which proposed in a July 2 press conference that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board change the rules of talaq.
As the practice stands, a man may divorce his wife instantly by uttering ‘‘talaq’’ three times. The MSD instead urged the board to follow the Holy Quran, which says that talaq should be pronounced over a period of three menstrual cycles.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Calling him a munafiq (infidel), the newspaper has delved into Akhtar’s marital life. A July 11 story is entitled: ‘‘How can a person who gave talaq to Honey Irani fight against talaq?’’
The acerbic essay questions Akhtar’s credibility, saying: ‘‘You don’t consider yourself to be a Muslim, and therefore have no right to interfere in the affairs of the AIMPLB.’’ Akhtar says, the newspaper is using abusive language instead of creating an informed debate on the issue.
But the editors stand by their reports. ‘‘Javed humiliated the AIMPLB in his press conference. He has no right to criticise such a body of eminent ulema. We have done stories with the utmost responsibility,’’ says Saeed Hameed, features editor of the Urdu Times.
Backing the newspaper’s attack is the AIMPLB. ‘‘We agree with what the paper is writing. Javed should keep his hands off the issue,’’ says Haroon Mozawalla, a member of the AIMPLB.
The MSD plans legal action against the daily. ‘‘The reports are not only in bad taste, they are also inflammatory and provocative,’’ protests Javed Anand, the MSD’s general secretary.  The Urdu Times has faced charges of inciting public disharmony in the past. In 1996, the Press Council of India issued strictures against it for inciting its readers and creating disharmony.
Akhtarspeak
‘‘One could have ignored it, had it been just a personal attack. The rhetorical tone of the stories may create disharmony. The MSD held conferences in cities across the country, talking to predominantly Muslim crowds. There was an overwhelming support and agreement.’’"

Gulshan Parveen, 30, cannot figure out why her consent matters in nikah and why it is irrelevant when it comes to talaq.
After Shayara Bano, Gulshan of Rampur in UP has filed a petition in Supreme Court asking for abolishing the practice of triple talaq. The English literature postgraduate says her husband sent her a talaqnama after subjecting her to domestic violence for dowry for over two years.

“I had no say. My husband felt like it one fine day and suddenly both my two-year-old son Ridan and I were homeless,” said Gulshan, who was sent the talaqnama on a Rs 10 stamp paper when she was with her parents last year. She refused to accept it, following which her husband approached Rampur family court asking for dissolution of marriage based on the talaqnama.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Wednesday, Supreme Court clubbed her petition with that of Uttarakhand-based Shayara Bano after Gulshan had approached the advocates dealing with the latter’s case.
Gulshan, youngest of six, married in April 2013. Last year, her husband was arrested on charges of dowry harassment and criminal intimidation. “Even after receiving Rs 2.5 lakh, clothes, electronics, furniture and crockery, they weren’t happy. My husband worked in Noida while I stayed in Rampur with my in-laws who took away my jewellery and demanded a car. On the few occasions my husband came home, I was often beaten with a iron rod,” she said.
For now, Gulshan shuttles between a rented house in Delhi and her brother’s home in Ghaziabad. “The only reason I want to return to my husband is that my son can grow up in a family,” she said."

BSP chief Mayawati Wednesday said voting for a “divided” Samajwadi Party will help BJP, which, she claimed, will end reservation if elected to power. The ruling party “stands divided” due to the feud in the Yadav clan and Shivpal and Akhilesh camps will harm each other, she said at election meetings in Badaun and Shahjahanpur.
“Even the vote base of the Samajwadi Party has been split and your vote will go waste… You should vote for the BSP that alone can stop BJP,” Maywati said. “For the love of his son, Mulayam Singh Yadav humiliated his brother Shivpal at every step. Therefore, Shivpal’s supporters will defeat Akhilesh,” she said.

Attacking the SP government, Mayawati said it “renamed” the welfare schemes launched by her dispensation and presented them as theirs. The BSP chief said if her party came to power, it will not distribute laptops and mobile phones but provide financial help so that people could buy items of their choice and requirement.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The BJP has failed in finding a chief ministerial face. The SP is banking on the tainted face of Akhilesh Yadav, in whose tenure, the state saw riots, loot and goondagardi,” she said. “Crores of rupees spent on highlighting development under the SP could have been put to better use … for improving the condition of the poor and deprived,” she said.
Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said: “He has done only one special thing … He made rich people close to him richer. BJP will end reservation if it came to power.” She said BJP was an “anti-minority” party and had tried to interfere in issues like ‘triple talaq’, which is a matter of grave concern.
“Besides, minorities are concerned that they are looked at with doubt in the name of terrorism,” she said, adding that the Prime Minister failed to deliver on the promises he made in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.
She said if BSP came to power, it “will waive off loans up to Rs one lakh taken by poor people, give them land, set up a commission for entrepreneurs, clear cane dues, give employment to the jobless in place of allowance and ensure better price for crops”."

Former Supreme Court judge Asok Kumar Ganguly on Saturday said that he was positive about the outcome of the apex court’s ruling on constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, hearing of which will begin on May 11. “I think none is above the Supreme Court. The justice which will be delivered after hearing will be final. I am positive about the outcome,” Justice Ganguly told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on triple talaq. He had been asked about the Muslim Personal Law Board’s stand on the issue.
“I have full confidence in the constitutional accountability of the Supreme Court,” he added.
“I wonder for how long women would be considered as commodity in this society. I think the Muslim women don’t feel free under the present triple talaq system,” Justice Ganguly said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Justice Ganguly referred to the outcry when Rammohan Roy had spearheaded the ‘Satidaho Birodhi’ (anti-bride burning) movement and Iswarchandra Vidyasagar called for widow remarriage in Hindu society in the 19th century.
The Supreme Court on March 30 had decided that a Constitution Bench would hear petitions challenging the constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims from May 11.
The Secretary of Progitisil Muslim Samaj, one of the organisations of the seminar, Robiul Islam said, “We, the Joint Movement Committee will undertake a concerted movement against triple talaq in Delhi in the run-up to the SC hearing.
“Over 8000 signatures, mostly from Muslim women, against triple talaq have been collected to be taken to Delhi,” he said.
“Tin Talaq can’t be supported. If there is talaq, let it come through the judicial process,” a woman member of the Reformist Muslim Society, another organiser, said."

The Supreme Court on Wednesday adjourned hearing in the Triple Talaq Case till September 6. The court observed that “issue of triple talaq has to be examined on the touchstone of constitutional framework and earlier verdicts.”
The apex court also asked all the respondents to frame legal issues concering the matter. Chief Justice of India also observed that it was a serious issue, ANI reported.
A number of Muslims have been demanding a ban on practice of Triple Talaq and terming it as ‘un-Islamic’. Many claim that the practice has been used by misinterpreting the Sharia law and Quran.
Muslim men can divorce their wives by just repeating the word Talaq thrice. The case against the practice came into highlights after one Shayra Banu challenged the personal law justice citing her fundamental rights."

Whether the conversion was spiritually inspired or matrimonially motivated is irrelevant. Religion is a matter of personal choice. As is the decision to marry at 67. Age matters only to the couple concerned. People can lead their lives as they see fit, and this includes choosing companions.
Kamala Das has always been something of a cult figure in Kerala. She does have an impact. Women with literary aspirations still hope to write like her. In that sense, her private life cannot be completely separated from the public sphere. In any case, she has never been a private person and has always relished wearing her pet hates and desires on her sleeve.
She is a respected writer. Hailing from the illustrious Nalappat family; daughter of the well-known poet and Jnanpith award winner, Balamani Amma, and Mathrubhoomi director V.M. Nair, she grew up in a intellectual and literary ambience. Her felicity with words found expression in everyliterary form fiction, the short story, poetry, and journalistic articles.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She has in her writing explicitly and imaginatively dealt with the grey area of sexual relations — acquiring the label of a free, uninhibited spirit. She is a wizard at anatomising the micro-mechanics of mental life, at charting the quicksilver zig-zags of the mind. Her writing has a carnal lyricism that escapes being pornographic. She is a master craftsperson when it comes to depicting every day life, straddling both the English and Malayalam literary worlds. Says writer-critic M. Leelavathy, “She is easily the best writer in Malayalam. Her short stories are examples of creative suggestive writing. 
Her Balyakala Smaranakal (Childhood Memories) is unmatched in brilliance.”Her autobiographical work, My Story, which came out in 1976, demolished traditional sexual barriers by dealing in female sexuality. For the first time, perhaps, in the history of women’s writing in India, the “love needs” or unsatisfied sexual yearnings ofwomen were delineated. That a woman writer could dare to speak in this fashion of female sexuality was something that the Kerala psyche could not easily countenance. Indeed, the reaction that her work evoked locally made Kamala Das feel rejected and alienated.
She was in her sixties, when she took took up painting seriously. Once again she shocked polite society her watercolours were largely of female nudes. But they provoked critics to read new insights into them and they certainly sold well. And whenever she spoke publicly, she emerged an ardent advocate of freedom in love. The media quoted her and courted her. Many women were inspired to look at her as an icon.
Yet today, as Sorayya she seems to have renounced those old ideals, projecting herself as a woman who prefers bondage to freedom. Bondage, with love. There are many ways of looking at Kamala Das’s conversion to Islam. For some, the fact that an upper-caste woman can convert to a minority religion is evidence of a commendable courage, albeit onetinged with eccentricity. Especially now when a strong anti-conversion drive has been launched by certain extremist Hindu groups. But then that is Kamala Das all over again. All her life she has enjoyed defying taboos.
Certainly, her action has electrified Kerala’s somewhat moribund social scene. The state, many feel, is evolving into a land of widows, with women outliving men and depression stalking the land. In such a scenario, Kamala may even appear to provide an alternative. Whether her change of heart is hormonal or spiritual, her joyful decision to marry, adopt a new religion, explore new realms of a faith and preach it to the world, injects not only optimism but euphoria.
There are many others who find the transformation of Kamala Das difficult to stomach. They point out that Islam, as it is practised in the country, oppresses women. The Vanitha Commission is flooded with complaints from Muslim women complaining of the pernicious effect of triple talaq. Points out Sugata Kumari, the chairperson ofthe Vanitha Commission, “The Quran does not allow triple talaq, it does not allow dowry, it permits second marriage only with the permission of the first wife and never for pleasure.” Yet family court advocates admit that divorced Muslim women are flocking to family courts, pleading for a meagre maintenance.
What women activists in the state fear is that Sorayya, could undermine efforts at reform within the community. “Women are still fighting for the right to enter the mosque. Male-dominated vested interests deny women every right. Oppressive practices like talaaq, polygamy, child marriage and denial of property rights still characterise Muslim society,” comments Zuhara, who heads NISA, a progressive women’s forum.
The fear is Sorayya by equating the purdah with Islam, is limiting a great religion to a dress code. She has justified the Muslim’s right to four wives. She views this archaic practice, once justified in the context of a desert economy, as a generous gesture — a gesture where a man gives“life” to four women.
On the threshold of a new millennium, Sorayya alias Kamala Das straddles two worlds one representing freedom, the other bondage; one progress, the other regression. In the process, she has set the cat among the pigeons. As always."

Chief Justice J.S. Khehar said on Thursday that there would be a thorough hearing of three matters by constitution benches, each of which, if not heard now, would “not be decided for years together”. Also last week, the Supreme Court allowed its proceedings to be recorded on camera, albeit without sound. Given the gargantuan problem of pendency facing the judiciary and the questions raised about its opacity, the urgency and transparency displayed by the apex court is a clear signal that even as it shapes institutional reform in other branches of government, it is also amenable to, and eager for, internal reform.
The decision to work during its holidays on cases involving constitutional questions comes on the heels of an “action plan” framed by the Supreme Court last month for cases more ordinary. In April 2016, there were 2.18 crore cases pending across India’s courts. The apex court asked high courts to issue directions to lower courts that bail applications should be disposed of within a week and sessions trials where the accused are in custody be concluded within two years. These efforts are meant to clear the backlog of cases more than five years old, which numbered over 43 lakh at the end of 2015, by the end of this year. The Supreme Court’s own contribution to pendency was at about 60,000 cases. By following up its order to subordinate courts with a visible display of urgency, the SC has set an example that must be followed by the rest of the judiciary.
The three constitutional matters coming up before the court — the validity of triple talaq and polygamy under Muslim Personal Law and the right to privacy with respect to social media — are of deep importance, with large political and social implications. The highest court in the land is the only one with the legal and moral authority to deal with them. In showing urgency and leading by example, the court has taken an important step in the right direction."

Freebies galore in the manifestos of political parties in Uttar Pradesh where laptops and smart phones are being promised even as loan waivers to farmers remain the mainstay of the assurances. Taking a leaf out of populist schemes from the south, the ruling Samajwadi Party has promised pressure cooker, food grains for the poor and ghee and milk for students besides expanding pension benefits under different schemes to one crore people.
The Samajwadi Party (SP), which had caught everyone’s attention with its manifesto in the last elections that promised providing students with laptops and tablets, has tried to tame its horses this time. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had decimated all rivals in 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the state, has gone a step ahead, promising laptop to every student “without discrimination” along with 1 GB internet data every month for a period of one year.
Watch What Else Is Making News:

The SP has this time promised laptops to meritorious students and smart phones for all. BJP and Congress, which is fighting the polls in alliance with SP, besides parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have all promised free wi-fi internet services in all colleges and universities, apparently to cash in on the ‘Digital India’ wave.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Like in the past, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, has stayed clear of coming out with a manifesto this elections, with its supremo Mayawati stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but “acting” on them. Congress has promised to provide free school education for every girl child and give free bicycles to girl students from Class IX to XII.
BJP, on the other hand, has announced free school education to all students and extending it till graduation for the meritorious ones. Notably, to instill a technical approach and scientific attitude among the students who passed class XII the state government had launched a scheme to provide a laptop to them.
In 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, Rs 3,43,009.91 crore were spent and 14,82,093 students covered in the scheme. In 2016-17, it was proposed to cover 39,600 students, according to an official UP government data on planning. With nearly 20 crore people, Uttar Pradesh remains a populous state. It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly.
The state, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people. BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs 1 lakh, while BJP, Congress, SP and RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.
In a bid to woo farmers, parties including BJP and SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan “karza maaf, bijli half” (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).
The BJP, in its manifesto called ‘Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra’, has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto. SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs 7.5 lakh from present Rs 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.
The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the state, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents. BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks’ time.
Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale. Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.
BJP said that on lines of the central government’s decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power. BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.
Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.
The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression. Even as its ally SP stressed on “social justice” while boasting of all-round development during last five years, Congress has vowed to provide free legal aid to all members of the SC, ST, OBC communities and appoint Suraksha Mitra to assist in filing of cases committed against Dalits.
Uttar Pradesh, which has time and again drawn flak for its law and order issues, notably has a 50 per cent shortage of police staff. According to a recent Union Home Ministry report, UP Police has been working with 1.80 lakh personnel as against a sanctioned strength of 3.64 lakh.
While Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has promised three promotions to police personnel on meet basis during the service tenure, BJP manifesto states recruitment of 1.5 lakh personnel on vacant slots. RLD has made a general pitch for early recruitments on all vacant positions under the state government. To ensure the safety of college girls, innovative “anti-Romeo squads” will be set up near colleges to check eve-teasing, said BJP.
While BJP once again raked up the issues of ‘Triple Talaq’ and Ram temple, promising its construction through constitutional measures, Congress promised bringing in law against “hate crimes”. On “exodus” of people due to communal tension, BJP said a special team would be formed to check it at district level and the District will be held responsible in such matters.
The Ajit Singh-led RLD has notably made a pitch for setting up four new benches of the Allahabad High Court, a demand that has been echoing in far-off parts of the state. An interesting overlap in promises has been seen in BJP and SP manifesto, both of which promised expanding the metro rail network, upgrading 100 police service, 108 ambulance service, among a few others.
Framing of policies to ensure ease of doing business, job creations, promotion of local handicrafts, skill development of youth, establishing cold storages among others have found place in manifestos of all political parties.
Invariably all parties’ manifestos promise improvement in healthcare services with BJP and SP assuring establishment of more AIIMS-like institutes, even as the first two AIIMS in Raebareli and Gorakhpur which were approved for UP in 2009 and 2012 respectively are yet to go operational."

On May 8, 1971, on the request of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, eminent jurist Nani Palkhivala had written to the government to bring in a Uniform Civil Code. The Congress, which now sees politics in it, should first find out what fate that letter met. I have raised this to drive home the point that the issue of the Uniform Civil Code was in the mind of a Prime Minister even in 1972. Besides, we have now sent the matter to the Law Commission for a detailed study. The government will take into consideration the mandate of Article 44 of the Constitution, the Law Commission’s report and its relation to the integration of the issue. The government will examine everything in its entirety before taking a stand.

On losing NJAC after an aggressive legal battle and the way forward:
The Supreme Court did what it had to do and we did what we are supposed to do as the government — defend a law. But there is no question of the government playing politics with judges and the Supreme Court. We respect and trust the judiciary. This government is committed to upholding the independence of the judiciary and whatever we do from here, it will be well within the constitutional framework and our rights.
On allegations that the government has resorted to arm-twisting tactics by not clearing appointments of judges:
I don’t see any problems between the judiciary and government. I am definite that the appointments will happen. There are issues following the NJAC judgment but we both (government and judiciary) are trying to resolve it. I am sure the ice will be broken soon and proper appointments will go through.
On whether the NDA was right in aggressively pursuing laws to make the NJAC and National Tax Tribunal a reality:
The UPA government must also share the blame for laws having been struck down by the Supreme Court; we cannot solely be held accountable. Besides, what other alternatives did we have? We had taken over as the government and we had to defend these laws. And then not everything was wrong with these legislation.
On BJP MP Subramanian Swamy seeking Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s removal for losing important cases:
It may be Mr Swamy’s personal view. The government and the party have faith in Mr Rohatgi’s ability as the top law officer.
On Chief Justice T S Thakur’s plea to increase the number of judges:
You cannot blame the Centre for this. The sanctioned strength has to come from the states and only then the question of funds arises. It is for the states to first prepare the infrastructure and then send us their revised sanctioned strengths for disbursal of funds.
On CJI’s appeal to the government to not criticise the judiciary alone for pendency of cases:
We don’t blame the judiciary for it but what can we do if people complain against the judiciary for delay in deciding cases. The criticism is mainly from the people, not the government. I maintain that the government has complete faith in the judiciary’s ability.
On finalising the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges:
It’s a secret document till it is notified. The issue is presently between the government and the judiciary. Meetings are taking place and we are hopeful that common ground will be reached very soon. At the same time, I can assure you that all the flaws in the previous MoP shall be removed from the new document. It has to be transparent and capable of guiding to appointment of good judges.
On whether judicial appointments were discussed in his meeting with the CJI:
I met the Hon’ble CJI as a courtesy call after I took over. I have always respected him as a judge. There was no formal interaction between us. We discussed our career and lives as lawyers. It was a very pleasant meeting.
On his appointment as MoS Law:
I had no idea of my appointment; I did not meet the Prime Minister before my appointment. One day, I was informed about my elevation and was told to be ready for this responsibility. My 38 years of experience as a lawyer and two years in the government will come handy in performing my duties."

Sajid Rashid, editor, Hindi Mahanagar, a staunch critic of triple talaq, accused Sayeed Ahmed, editor of Urdu Times, after he was stabbed twice in the back outside his office in Mahim on Tuesday night.

Rashid—once don Dawood Ibrahim’s classmate and author of an acclaimed book on Mumbai’s seamy underbelly—was rushed to KEM Hospital in central Mumbai and is out of danger.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
‘‘As I came down from my office and was about to start my bike, a bearded, well-built man came up to me, asking: Tera naam Sajid hai? Tum Quran ki toheen karta hai (Are you Sajid? You insult the holy Quran),’’ explained Rashid. ‘‘Then he pushed me while his companion stabbed me twice in the back.’’

The police said they had identified one assailant and he was likely to be arrested soon. But Rashid has blamed Ahmed of masterminding the murderous attack.

Ever since Muslims for Secular Democracy, a progressive body (Rashid is its vice-president, poet Javed Akhtar, president), held a press meet on July 2 to express their views on talaq, Ahmed’s newspaper has been critical of Sajid. Akhtar and Rashid had asked the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to discuss triple talaq in its Kanpur session and drop it.

Rashid says the Urdu Times has instigated Muslims against members of MSD. However, Ahmed dismisses the allegations: ‘‘He has accused me because of a personal grudge. I am ready to face any investigation.’’

Rashid, as head of the Maharashtra Urdu Akademy, had held a seminar on Urdu scholar late Krishan Chander on June 12-13 where Ali Ahmed Fatmi, an Allahabad-based scholar, called the Quran “propaganda.”  It was nearly a month later, on July 14, that Urdu Times criticised Fatmi for ‘‘anti-Quran’’ utterances. The newspaper said it had targeted Rashid because he “sided with the scholar.”

Countdown to attack

On June 12 Rashid organises a seminar where a scholar makes anti-Quran remark

• On July 2 Rashid, Javed Akhtar and other members of MSD hold a press conference in Mumbai, asking the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to discuss triple talaq.

• Urdu Times carries a series of articles against Rashid.

• MSD files a complaint with Police Commissioner A N Roy against Urdu Times.

• Between August 9 and 12, Rashid is chased near J J Hospital. He files a complaint at Dongri police station on August 16.

Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would decide issues pertaining to “legal” aspects of the practices of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and would not deal with the question whether divorce under Muslim law needs to be supervised by courts as it falls under the legislative domain. “You (lawyers for parties) sit together and finalise the issues to be deliberated upon by us. We are listing it day after tomorrow for deciding the issues,” a bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud said.

The bench made it clear to the parties concerned that it would not deal with the factual aspects of the particular case and would rather decide the legal issue.
“We are not interested with facts at all. We are only interested in dealing with the legal issue,” the bench said.

The apex court said that the question whether divorce under Muslim Personal Law needs to be supervised by either courts or by a court-supervised institutional arbitration falls under the legislative domain.
The court, meanwhile, allowed the lawyers to file small synopsis of cases pertaining to alleged victims of triple talaq. The Centre had earlier opposed the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Ministry of Law and Justice referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries.
Responding to a batch of petitions including the one filed by Shayaro Bano challenging the validity of such practices among Muslims, the Centre first dealt with the right of gender equality under the Constitution.
All India Muslim Personal Law Board, however, had rubbished the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental rights like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
Another prominent Islamic organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind told the court there is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law in which triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy are well rooted and stand on much higher pedestal as compared to other customs."

With the battle against triple talaq gaining momentum day by day, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Monday said he awaits the verdict from Supreme Court for all Muslim women and wishes for improvement. “My concern is towards to the 10 lakh Muslim women in the country who face issues regarding the triple talaq. I’m totally against it and hope that Supreme Court comes out with a positive verdict,” Aiyar told ANI.
Aiyar further asserted that apex court should prohibit the word ‘triple talaq’. “I totally disagree and wish that apex court puts a ban on the word and act against triple talaq,” said Aiyar. Earlier this week, over a million Muslims from across India had signed a petition to end the controversial divorce practice of triple talaq.
The petition was started by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an Islamic organisation affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), adding that the positive response to the petition has been linked with the Bharatiya Janata Patry’s recent success in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Several women have filed a petition before the apex court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice. The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.

However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her.
Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that he favoured the discontinuation of ‘triple talaq’, stating that “lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be destroyed by triple talaq.” He also targeted the opposition for ‘politicising’ the issue and supporting a gender discriminatory practice to appease their vote banks."

Of the three issues relating to Muslim personal law in India — triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy — coming up soon for hearing before a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court, the first is an easy-to-pluck low-hanging fruit. Muslims who are hoping for a verdict that declares these practices not only unconstitutional but also “un-Quranic” confidently cite unambiguous verses from the holy scripture on the issue of triple talaq and even nikah halala.
But on the issue of polygamy, they dither in taking a head-on stand against the ulema’s centuries-old, male-centred interpretation of the Quranic injunction.
The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan’s affidavit in support of Shayara Bano’s petition, for example, seeks the declaration of triple talaq and nikah halala as un-Quranic, but is silent on the polygamy issue. Numerous articles penned in recent months by Muslims for the print media have also remained focused on triple talaq (instant divorce). The odd comment piece on polygamy by a Muslim has, if anything, sought to justify the practice among Muslims through a dubious reference to the plight of Hindu “mistresses” who are “denied the right that a second wife enjoys among Muslims”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even the late Bohra reformist, Islamic scholar and a tireless champion for gender justice, Asghar Ali Engineer, remained opposed to a total ban on polygamy since the Quran permits it under certain conditions. Over 20 Muslim majority countries have outlawed triple talaq in recent years. Many have also imposed strict court-supervised conditions before a husband takes a second wife. But most have yet to take the final step: Monogamy.
The ulema’s theological defence of polygamy hangs on a single verse of the Quran which reads: “And if you fear that you may not be just to the orphans, then you may marry whom you please of the women: Two, and three, and four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then only one, or what your right hand possesses (slaves)” (4:3).
The patriarchs of Islam forget to remind their flock of two other relevant verses of the Quran which read: “You will not be able to treat all women equally even if you wish to do so” (4:129), or, “Allah has not made for any man two hearts” (33.4). It has been left to women (some men too) scholars of Islam such as Amina Wadud, Asma Barlas and others to point out that the continued justification of polygamy is not a Quranic licence but a convenient male construct.
In her book Quran and Women: Reading the Sacred Text from a Woman’s Perspective, Wadud points to the verse preceding 4.3 to argue that both verses are specifically about the treatment of orphans, justice to orphans. Wadud challenges the ulema’s blinkered notion of “treating all women equally”.
“In fact, as far as they are concerned, the only measurement of justice between wives is material: Can a man equally support more than one wife? This is an extension of the archaic idea of marriages of subjugation, because (this criteria of) fairness is not based on quality of time, equality in terms of affection, or on spiritual, moral and intellectual support.”
As relevant is the context of the revelation of these verses. The male members in the then-miniscule Muslim population which was counted in hundreds was seriously decimated in the battle of Uhud. This created a major gender imbalance and the very survival of Islam’s followers was at stake. Wadud, among others, systematically demolishes the common justifications in support of polygamy of which there is neither mention, nor sanction in the Quran.
First, there is the financial argument. Since women are financially dependent on men, those who can afford it may marry more than one wife. This is not an argument based on the Quran. Besides, it is no longer true in today’s world that only men engage in paid work.
Two, the argument regarding women’s inability to bear children. This too finds no mention in the Quran. Moreover, with the advance of medical science, it is easy to establish whether infertility has to do with the husband or wife. Also, in today’s world, there are multiple options — adoption being only one of them — for a couple to raise children even if the wife is not able to conceive.
Three, the argument that men have a stronger sexual drive than women. This not only lacks Quranic sanction but, as Wadud argues, it is un-Quranic. “It is clear that the Quran does not stress a high, civilised level for women while leaving men to interact with others at the basest level”.
Four, it is pointed out that the Prophet himself had multiple wives. In a paper titled, ‘There are Worse Things Than Being Alone: Polygamy in Islam, Past, Present and Future’, Heather Johnson makes two points. One, all but one of Mohammad’s wives was a widow. “From all accounts his marriages were inspired not by lust or greed but rather by compassion and diplomatic design. Each of his wives came from a different clan or tribe, his marriages to each was a political alliance.”
Two, Johnson quotes verse 33.50 of the Quran to point out that certain permissions were specifically, “Only for thee (Prophet) and not for the believers (at large)”. In the mid-1990s, two judges from a division bench of the Dhaka High Court had ruled that in the modern context, the only possible interpretation of the Quranic injunction on marriage was monogamy.
It is another matter that in the changed political dispensation in Bangladesh a few days later, the Supreme Court had quashed the high court order. Whether our Constitution Bench should limit itself to the constitutional validity of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy, or whether it should also examine them in the light of Quranic teachings, as some petitioners have pleaded, may be a debatable question.
The point, however, remains that there are today Islamic scholars, women and men, who consider the current-day practice of polygamy as un-Quranic, in letter and in spirit."

RSS on Tuesday expressed hope that Muslim women who have moved the court seeking abolition of triple talaq would secure justice, even as it said it wants the community to give a serious thought to the issue. “The triple talaq issue is an internal problem of Muslims and in this context the Muslim community should seriously think over it. In the present era there should not be any kind of gender-based discrimination. On talaq issue, women have gone to court and we expect they get justice properly,” RSS All India General Secretary Bhayyaji Joshi told reporters.
“The Muslim community should also think and decide on it. We feel that there is a need that the court should also give (its) views on this matter through human perspective,” he said on the concluding day of the three-day All India Executive Council Meetings of RSS.
On Uniform Civil Code, Joshi said, “We have been stressing that to stop any kind of discrimination in personal life it should be done through law without disturbing social fabric. Law Commission has sought opinion on UCC and the Commission should consider the viewpoints (of public) and based on it, the Commission has to spell out its opinion..that is what we feel.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Reacting to a query on surgical strikes, the senior RSS leader said, “In our country we are experts in politicising on any issue. Government has to take a decision which it took and the Army has to take action which it did.”
“We need to appreciate the present (NDA) government for taking a decision for surgical strikes and at the same time the surgical strikes were conducted on Army’s might. Hence, the army and the government, both are commendable for the surgical strikes…that is what we feel,” he said.
Asked about RSS’ stand on Pakistan artistes, Joshi said “Iske sandharb me sabhi ko udarta aur pramanikta se sochna chahiye.” If the Pakistani artistes say that they don’t want to work in Indian movies then why India is so eager on welcoming them, he asked, adding, “Do we have scarcity of artistes in India?”. He said making movies with only Indian artistes is a welcome step.
“Moreover, why we should be dependent on others for artistes. I think this dependency has to get over.”
Reacting to another query, on call for boycott of Chinese goods on social media, Joshi said, “Our stand has been that we should buy only Indian goods. Why only Chinese? When the alternatives (of products) are available. But, there are certain products for which alternatives are not there and we don’t say.”
“We have been saying that not only Chinese products but people should purchase natural products made in India and that stand continues,” Joshi added."

(File Photo)
Amid the row over the government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court for abolishing triple talaq, senior BJP leader and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Sunday stressed that there is a “fundamental distinction between religious practices, rituals and civil rights”. In a Facebook post titled “Triple Talaq and the Government’s Affidavit”, Jaitley, a former Union law minister, said the government is of the clear view that “personal laws should be constitutionally compliant and in conformity with norms of gender equality”. He took a dig at previous governments for not taking a categorical stand on the issue.

“The government’s view is clear. Personal laws have to be constitutionally compliant and the institution of Triple Talaq, therefore, will have to be judged on the yardstick of equality and the Right to Live with Dignity. Needless to say that the same yardstick would be applicable to all other personal laws. As of today, the issue before the Supreme Court is only with regard to the constitutional validity of triple talaq. Governments in the past have shied from taking a categorical stand that personal laws must comply with fundamental rights. The present government has taken a clear position,” Jaitley said.
He underlined that the issue with regard to the constitutional validity of triple talaq is distinct from the Uniform Civil Code. “The academic debate with regard to the Uniform Civil Code can go on before the Law Commission. The question to be answered is that assuming that each community has its separate personal law, should not those personal laws be constitutionally compliant?” Jaitley said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said the framers of the Constitution had expressed hope in the Directive Principles of State Policy that the state would endeavour to have a Uniform Civil Law. He also referred to various changes brought by governments in the past in Hindu personal laws and provisions of marriage and divorce relating to the Christian community in order to bring about gender equality.
“Governments, legislatures and communities have to respond to the need for a change. As communities have progressed, there is a greater realisation with regard to gender equality.” he said."

AT A time when the BJP-led Central government has been raising the issue of triple talaq in the Muslim community, the Girls Islamic Organisation, a woman’s wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami-e-Hind, has launched a state-wide campaign in Gujarat to raise awareness among the Muslim community on Muslim Personal Laws, as well as started initiatives to “clear misconceptions” harboured by other communities, regarding the important issues pertaining to talaq and marriages.
On Saturday, members of GIO— Fatima Tanveer and Razia Shaikh—arrived in Vadodara to kick off the campaign, which will continue until May 7. Addressing the issue of triple talaq and marriages in Islam, Tanveer said, “We are planning to undertake mohalla meetings, public gatherings, table top discussions as well as door-to-door campaign to educate the Muslim community members about the issues of personal laws, so that they do not get swayed by the misconceptions that are being promoted these days such as triple talaq and polygamy.” Tanveer blamed the ongoing campaign against triple talaq as a “conspiracy” to influence Muslims who are unaware of the personal laws.
Speaking about Muslim women, who have reportedly supported Narendra Modi in public on his stand on triple talaq, Tanveer said, “We do not know if these women are really Muslim or not. Islam is a religion that does not believe in coercion. Anyone who wants to follow the tenets based on the commandments of Allah, is free to do so. None of us has the right to alter these tenets.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tanveer added that the Shariah law is sacrosanct and cannot be altered and said that the notion of triple talaq being torturous to a woman is wrong. “The Shariah law has provisions for the couple to mutually discontinue their marriage through talaq as well as to reconcile after the first and second talaqs if they feel they have fondness for each other. It is not to be uttered in one go, like many people believe. If it is spoken in one go, then the damage is done. We are trying to educate our community members about it,” she added.
The JIH will also hold signature campaigns across the country after the 15 days programme to sensitise people, especially women, in the community on the issues."

On March 7, the woman lodged a complaint of physical and mental harassment against her husband and seven others, including her in-laws, at the Wanavdi police station under sections 377, 498 (a), 323, 504, 506, 109, 342, 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

“We had gathered at a relative’s place for a discussion to settle the dispute… not for triple talaq. Believing that things would improve, I had also purchased new clothes and sweets for my daughter before going for the discussion….I have decided to fight against the injustice done to my daughter. I have contacted Pune Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla on WhatsApp. We hope that she will help us. We want police to take strict action against the accused,” said the complainant’s father.
The woman and her father have also sought help from the Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal (MSM), a non-governmental organisation fighting for the rights of Muslim women. MSM president Shamshuddin Tamboli said, “In this case, the woman has already filed a police complaint against the alleged criminal acts of her husband.

For those of us whose interest in Indian politics is as fleeting as a second, there was only one Yogi in our lives. That is, until Saturday afternoon. If you had asked us, “Yogi who?”, we’d have smartly and promptly replied, “Yogi Bear”.

As of last weekend, that’s the incorrect answer: The lovable cartoon character has been unceremoniously displaced by Yogi Adityanath, the newly appointed chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. And trust television to make a song and dance of him; throughout Sunday, we were shown people in Gorakhpur, and in his Uttarakhand village, contort their bodies to the beat of a dholak, while news channels like News State and Samay broke into happy song: “Yogi, Yogi, Yogi, ek naya armaan hai, Yogi, Yogi Yogi”. Or, “UP ke dhadkan mein Yogi, Yogi.” (NDTV India) This, to the same beat as “Modi, Modi, Modi” that rang out at Adityanath’s swearing-in on Sunday afternoon, when the PM took to the stage.

TV news red-carpeted Yogi Adityanath and carpet-bombed us with coverage of him, about him and his oath of office with such enthusiasm, in such detail, at such great length, you’d have thought Narendra Modi was being anointed. At the very least.
TV celebrated the “firebrand’s” elevation with pomp and show on “Coronation Sunday” (Times Now). News X grandiosely called it “Vijay Diwas” which, for those of us who can think back that far, referred to the victory in Bangladesh in 1971. And others acted like an airport loudspeaker announcement system: “BJP CMs reach LK” (India Today), “Advani, Manohar Joshi at Lucknow airport” (News X), “Amit Shah reaches Lucknow” (Zee News). “PM Modi has just arrived” (India Today) — for many minutes, we stared at the open door of an aircraft, waiting for the PM to emerge.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sure, this was a state visit, but TV was treating it like Donald Trump was about to land in India.
News channels interviewed ecstatic supporters who said that UP was celebrating the happy occasion (NDTV India); they interviewed happy new ministers. Swati Singh was asked what her children thought of her appointment: “My daughter is happy” (what else could she be?). They stood at Smriti Irani, sorry, Smriti Upvan, and laughingly showed us BJP-wallahs or supporters fighting to get a pass into the ceremony like it was the premiere of the latest Salman Khan blockbuster — “One hour to go” (ABP).
It was quite a moment for the “Saffron mascot” (Times Now) when the entire nation watched him take the oath. As the national anthem played, the energy out there for “Modi, Modi, Modi”, “Yogi, Yogi, Yogi”, was enough to light up all of UP’s powerless villages.
And did you see the official residence of “#NewIndiaYogi” being “cleansed” and blessed, as if the previous occupant had left behind contagious diseases (India TV)?
TV left nothing unsaid, unseen or to the imagination as it dogged Yogi’s every step.
It also questioned his appointment: “Is this choosing Hindutva or development?”. Or, “Is this Hindutva with development?”, asked Gaurav Sawant, who instantly took a commercial break after the question to figure out the answer (India Today). Since nobody on any channel really knew the answer, they went fishing, raising every issue they could think of: Ram Mandir, polarisation, the end of appeasement, election 2019, Yogi as a future PM, triple talaq, slaughterhouse politics, blah, blah, blah — everything flew around like hot-air balloons, needlessly raising the pitch in the TV studios when “YogiGetsUP” had still to get down to business.
By Tuesday evening, we’d had enough of “#YogiUPKaNath” puns and it was a relief to switch to CNN and BBC to catch the FBI Director and National Security Advisor being questioned by the House Intelligence Committee on Donald, Obama, Clinton about “those Russians”.
On an entirely different note, I watched Chitrahaar (DD National, Sunday) and was delighted to discover it still existed. It seems to have changed: It profiled Shashi Kapoor and featured songs from his films. Lovely. Also, watch out for Feud (Star Premiere HD), starring Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange as the famous actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, warring during the shooting of the film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. Deliciously vile."

BJP leader Shazia Ilmi on Wednesday alleged that her name was removed from a panel of speakers who were supposed to speak at Jamia Millia Islamia university, allegedly at the behest of the university Vice-Chancellor and the Provost.
Ilmi said she was supposed to speak at a seminar on women empowerment Tuesday but was not allowed to speak. The university has denied any involvement in changes in the programme. The seminar was organised by RSS-supported Forum for Awareness of National Security. The seminar was earlier on the topic of triple talaq, but was later changed to women empowerment.

“There was a lot of pressure on the organisers. First they changed the topic from triple talaq to women empowerment. Then they wanted me to be dropped from the speakers’ list. In the first invitation, my name was there but in the second card my name was removed,” Ilmi said. The university, however, said they had only rented the auditorium to the organisers.
“The event was not organised by the university or any of its department. The auditorium was rented out to an NGO and in such event, the varsity has nothing to do with either the subject or choice of speakers. It was not our prerogative,” a Jamia spokesperson said. Meanwhile, BJP Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari said, “The denial of permission to hold a seminar on triple talaq is in itself denial of freedom of speech, and it must be established under whose pressure the university authorities denied the permission.”"

This is the nub of the matter: Obliterate Muslim identity. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)
There is absolutely no case for enacting a uniform civil code. But there is an unanswerable case for abolition of the un-Islamic triple talaq. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech, at Mahoba in UP on October 24, professing profuse and unprecedented concern for “my Muslim sisters”, impressed none; UP goes to polls early in 2017.
For over half a century, the BJP, and the Jan Sangh before it, made the code a vital part of their election manifesto. In 1989, it was one of the three conditions that qualified its support to the National Front government. It has no issue on Article 371A on Nagaland which bars legislation by Parliament on “Naga Customary law and procedure” and “administration of civil and criminal justice” involving that law in Mizoram enjoys a similar “special status”.
Before Partition, Muslims were offered solemn pledges of respect for their personal law; by Gandhi on October 28, 1931, the Congress in October 1937 and by Nehru on April 6, 1937. Gandhi offered “protection by specific provisions” in the Constitution. Instead, Article 44 of the Constitution was enacted. “The state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
B. R. Ambedkar told the Constituent Assembly that this did not mandate legislation.
The BJP’s partner, the Shiv Sena, was candid. Its supremo Uddhav Thackeray demanded on October 22, “They (the BJP) should first announce that this country is a Hindu rashtra and impose the uniform civil code”. This is the nub of the matter: Obliterate Muslim identity.
Hence, the Muslims’ opposition. It is the lust for uniformity that alienates people. A small UK has two systems of criminal law. Scottish law recognises the plea of “not proven”, English law does not. There is no national bar; England has barristers, Scotland has advocates.
“National integration” is a red herring. Muslims are well integrated in Sri Lanka where they have their own personal law which a Supreme Court judge has praised. Quebec has its own legal system. Singapore and Israel accept Muslim personal law. Aharon Layish wrote a paper in July 1973 on “The Sharia in Israel”. The modern trend is for acceptance of diversity.
Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is party, concerns minority rights. Francisco Caportori’s report on its implementation (1977) says: “In Africa and Asia, particularly in the countries in which customary law is an integral part of the general legal system, various ethnic groups are still governed in matters of personal status and other fields of private law by their own rules. There cannot be any doubt that an effective and full protection of the culture of minorities would require the preservation of their customs and legal traditions, which form an integral part of their way of life.”
Sir Norman Anderson, an authority on Hindu and Muslim law, wrote, “It is the family law that has always represented the very heart of the Shariah for it is the part of the law that is regarded by Muslims as entering into the very warp and woof of their religion.” It has been “basic to Muslim society down the centuries”. A former vice-president of India and Law Minister, G.S. Pathak told the Lok Sabha, on May 17, 1966, that he appreciated that “personal laws are mixed up with religion” and that “we cannot coerce people to accept our views about their religion and customs”.
However, the Muslim law in force in India is Anglo-Muhammadan law based on English commentaries and translations. It is not based on the Quran, the Shariah. English judges on the Privy Council, ignorant of the Quran, held in 1897 that the courts in India should not “put their own construction on the Quran in opposition to the express ruling of commentators”.
In 1971, Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer ruled in the Kerala High Court that “the view that the Muslim husband enjoys an arbitrary, unilateral power to inflict instant divorce does not accord with Islamic injunctions… Indeed, a deeper study of the subject discloses a surprisingly rational, realistic and modern law of divorce… It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim male enjoys, under the Quranic law, unbridled authority to liquidate the marriage… Commentators on the Quran have rightly observed — and this tallies with the law now administered in some Muslim countries like Iraq — that the husband must satisfy the court about the reasons for divorce. However, Muslim law, as applied in India, has taken a course contrary to the spirit of what the Prophet or the Holy Quran laid down and the same misconception vitiates the law dealing with the wife’s right to divorce. After quoting from the Quran and the Prophet, Galwash concludes that “divorce is permissible in Islam only in cases of extreme emergency. When all efforts for effecting reconciliation have failed, the parties may proceed to a dissolution of the marriage by ‘talaq’ or by ‘khula’.”
Justice Baharal Islam of the Gauhati High Court took the same view in 1978: “In my view the correct law of talaq as ordained by the Holy Quran is that talaq must be for a reasonable cause and be preceded by attempts at reconciliation between the husband and the wife by two arbiters — one from the wife’s family, the other from the husband’s. If the attempts fail, talaq may be effected.” Both judges were elevated to the Supreme Court.
In Shamim Ara’s case (2002), the Supreme Court approved of the views of Justices Krishna Iyer and Baharal Islam. In Pakistan, the courts discarded the Privy Council’s view and began creatively to interpret the Quran on the triple talaq. Indian jurists and activists must not lay behind. They must formulate at least three texts as alternatives to that talaq and submit them to the Supreme Court.
They can adopt the rules in Pakistan’s Family Laws Ordinance 1961. It provides for an Arbitration Council to bring about a reconciliation and a 90-day period for retraction. Talaq must be pronounced by a notice in writing and communicated to the Council’s chairman. The wife can stipulate a right to divorce in the nikahnama (talaq tafuriz). She had additionally the right to divorce (khula). She can even add stipulations in the nikahnama on visits to her family, pocket money and a bar on a second wife.

Muslim women fighting to ban “triple talaq” divorce and polygamy from family civil law in top court condemned on Tuesday justifications given by Islamic clerics as “medieval” and “reeking of sexism”.

Supreme Court of India is currently hearing a petition filed by women’s rights activists who want the judiciary to declare triple talaq – where Muslim men can divorce by simply stating their intention three times verbally – as unconstitutional.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Constitution of India allows most religions, including Muslims – the biggest religious minority group – to regulate matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance through their own civil code.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), a non-governmental body which oversees the application of Muslim personal law, opposes any ban on triple talaq and polygamy.
It told the court on Friday that triple talaq was necessary, saying men have greater reasoning power compared to women, and that a man giving triple talaq to his wife was a better option than murdering her or burning her alive.
The AIMPLB also argued that polygamy was a “social need” and a “blessing” as a lawful second wife was better than an unlawful mistress and added that it gave divorced or widowed women more opportunity to remarry.
“Muslim women in the country have suffered because of triple talaq where arbitrary divorces declared over postcards or telegrams have been sustained,” said campaign group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), or the India Muslim Women’s Movement.
“AIMPLB’s argument that a Muslim man can delegate his power of pronouncing talaq to his wife is laughable – this can hardly be expected to happen in real life if the wife wants a divorce but husband doesn’t,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.
The group said the AIMPLB’s justification for polygamy was “bizarre” as it had suggested the practice of a man having up to four wives stemmed from a concern and sympathy for women.
“The truth is Muslim personal laws – like other religious laws – flow from patriarchy and relegate women to second class status,” said the BMMA.
It said triple talaq had been banned in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh while polygamy was prohibited in Turkey and Turkmenistan among other countries.
Muslims make up more than 13 percent of the country’s 1.2 billion people, yet they are among some of the most marginalised communities.
Social indicators amongst Muslim women such as literacy, mortality and employment rates are lower than the national average, say activists.
Triple talaq is unilateral, arbitrary and contravenes both the constitution and the principles of gender justice in Islam, BMMA said. In a secular and democratic country like India, religious laws could not overwrite the constitutional right to equality, it added."

In the face of strong opposition to Uniform Civil Code by Muslim outfits, Congress on Thursday said its implementation would be impossible while BJP asserted that the move is aimed at moving towards a progressive society. Other opposition parties like JD(U) accused the BJP-led central government of trying to polarise the people ahead of Assembly polls in several states, with leader of Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) Asaduddin Owaisi saying that bringing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will “kill” the diversity and plurality of India.

Earlier in the day, the All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board and some other outfits opposed the Law Commission’s questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code, including abolition of ‘triple talaq’ and announced their boycott of the move, accusing the government of waging a “war” against the community.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If you enforce something in the name of Uniform Civil Code, then it will kill the diversity and plurality of the country. It’s not right to look at it from a Muslim perspective because Indian diversity also comprises of Dalits and Tribals. There are different traditions in Hinduism as well,” he said.
Owaisi said the government’s “real agenda” was to focus on Muslims and polarise the society.

Reacting to the issue, former Law Minister and Congress leader Veerappa Moily said it will be difficult to implement UCC in a country like India where various communities and groups are governed by personal laws.
“In a country of this nature, implementation of Uniform Civil Code is next to impossible,” he said adding no one should take it as a communal agenda or a Hindu versus Muslim issue. He said 200-300 personal laws exist in India covering various communities.
BJP national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh said the Law Commission is taking opinion of all the stakeholders on the issue following which it will form a “considered opinion” and give it to the Supreme Court.
“Now it is for the Muslim Personal Law Board to consider whether they want to be part of the stakeholders or they want to be an individual identity… if Personal Law Board people are misinformed, I cannot do much about it,” he said.
Singh also referred to some international declarations and countries like Turkey, Iran and Indonesia saying they changed law to ensure gender equality. He said it was a move towards building a progressive society.
JD(U) MP Ali Anwar asked the government why it was only focusing on Muslims and said it is not the time to start such a debate. “They want to polarise the society.”
Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said “for how long the Muslims will stay away from the national mainstream. The Muslim Law Board should support the UCC as it will help the community, especially the women to come out of misery.
“Our party’s stand is ‘one code, one law’ and it should be viewed as a national issue rather than religious one.”
In his reaction, Owaisi said those pushing for UCC were not aware of India’s pluralism and diversity.
“They are not understanding India’s beauty where there is a different culture every 200-300 kms. If you make one culture to all, then its not going to work. MIM will certainly respond to the questionnaire,” he said.
He said, “We have given cultural rights to people of Mizoram and Nagaland. Are you going to end that?”
Making perhaps the first such move, the Law Commission had on October 7 sought feedback from public on whether the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional."

BJP will not project a chief ministerial candidate for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections which are a few months away, party’s state unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said on Monday.

“All political parties are waiting for the chief ministerial candidate of BJP…It is clear policy of our party that we will contest the Assembly elections without projecting anyone as our CM candidate,” he told news persons in Bareilly. “BJP had projected CM faces in Assam and Delhi Assembly polls…While we succeeded in the former, we lost the latter…We fought Haryana and Jharkhand without projecting any CM candidate and won,” Maurya said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said BJP will win over 300 of the 403 seats in UP and the party’s central parliamentary board will decide who has to be the chief minister. Earlier in Badaun, Maurya accused BSP chief Mayawati of degrading religious leaders for which, he said, the electorate will teach her a lesson in the coming polls.
Reacting to Mayawati’s charges that RSS and BJP workers were presented as Buddhist monks in the ‘Dhamma Chetna Yatra’ in Kanpur last week, Maurya said, “Her mental balance appears a little disturbed as a large number of her party men have deserted her.
“By making this statement, she has degraded religious leaders and Lord Buddha as well and she will see its result through the EVMs,” he said. To a question as to whether BJP will accept Akhilesh Yadav in its fold if he quits SP, Maurya said no member of the Saifai family has any place in his party. Saifai is the native place of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav.
When his attention was drawn to controversial SP leader Azam Khan facing sediton charges in a Badaun court, Maurya said only BJP government can arrest him in connection with various cases and charges. Terming ‘triple talaq’ as anti-women, he said it needs to be done away with.
Maurya also warned Pakistan to desist from anti-India stance or “else Indian forces will unfurl the tri-colour in Islamabad soon”"

An 18-year-old girl, Arshiya Bagwan from Baramati, who was divorced by her husband through ‘triple talaq as per the Sharia Law’, narrated her ordeal at a press conference in Pune on Friday. Bagwan, who got married at the age of 16, said to the media that she ‘refuses to accept the divorce’ and ‘plans to move the family court for justice’.

At a press conference organised by the Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal, an organisation that has been fighting for the rights of Muslim women, Arshiya said she got married on May 6, 2014 to Mohammed Kazim Salim Bagwan (23), a resident of Baramati and a vegetable trader at the local market yard.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Arshiya alleged that her mother-in-law harassed her a lot, even when she was pregnant. She has a son, who is now eight months old. Daughter of a vegetable vendor, Nisar Sikander Bagwan, Arshiya said, “My parents are not financially sound but still bore the expenses of my marriage and also gave dowry. The financial condition of my in-laws is good but still they harassed me…. While we were married, my husband and in-laws had promised me that they would let me pursue my studies. I had scored 74 per cent marks in SSC exams. In Class XI, I scored 78 per cent marks. But after marriage, they did not allow me to study further,” she said.
Owing to alleged harassment by in-laws, Arshiya said that she left her husband’s home, but tried to contact her husband repeatedly. According to Arshiya, he stopped taking her calls.
“My husband stopped receiving my calls. So I decided to meet him at his work place. He promised to take me back in two days and also assured me that we would stay separately to avoid further disputes. But he never came and on October 8, we received a notice from my husband giving me triple talaq,” she said.
In the notice, sent through a lawyer on a Rs 100 stamp paper, Arshiya’s husband has accused her and her family of misbehaviour and has cited that as one of the reasons for ‘talaq-ul biddat’ (triple talaq) ‘as per Sharia’.
He also alleged in the notice that various meetings were held with the family members to resolve the matter, but her family members ‘quarreled and ransacked’ his house, due to which he filed a non-cognizable offence against her brother and father at the Baramati police station. Arshiya’s family said these are false allegations. In the notice, Mohammed Kazim has mentioned “Arshiya maine tuze talaq diya” thrice. The notice dated October 5 also bears signatures of two witnesses.
“My husband said ‘Tu mazya manatun utarli ahes (You have no place in my heart)’ and gave this as the reason for giving me triple talaq. I refuse to accept this,” she said. Arshiya’s father, Nisar, said, “We were shocked when we saw the notice. We spoke to the Ulema and Jamaat members of our community. But they couldn’t help us as triple talaq was carried out as per the Sharia Law. This is injustice.” Mohammad Kazim gave Rs 3,000 as “iddat” (compensation) to Arshiya along with the notice. “I have returned this money,” said Nisar.Pune NewsRailways moots use of automated scavenging mini truck to keep tracks cleanFire breaks out at gas pipeline in Pune’s Ambegaon Khurd area, brought under control swiftlyPune: Industries trying to set up Covid vaccination camps on their premisesClick here for more
Mohammad Kazim was not available for comment despite repeated attempts to reach him. Meanwhile, Professor Shamshuddin Tamboli, president of Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal, said, “Arshiya approached us after reading newspaper reports about our organisation. We are protesting against the triple talaq.”"

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati, during an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, declared that her party does not agree with interference in the Centre’s stance on the Triple Talaq issue as well as the Uniform Civil Code. Attacking PM Modi and his sweeping statements made during the election campaign for the BJP in the state, Mayawati said in Fatehpur that the prime minister’s “drama” is not going to win him any favours. “People won’t bless BJP, no matter how much drama PM Modi does by calling himself an adopted son of UP,” the BSP chief said.

“People are angry with PM due to his wrong policies, in such situation BJP have not yet dared to project a CM face in UP,” Mayawati said, attacking the chink in BJP’s armour.
Targeting rival Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati said that his brother Shivpal Yadav can prove to be detrimental to the health of Samajwadi Party’s chief ministerial candidate Akhilesh Yadav and his fraction. “The way Mulayam Singh Yadav has insulted his brother Shivpal Yadav everywhere, Shivpal and his team will surely harm Akhilesh and his team,” she said.

Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional, the Law Commission had on October 7 asked the people seeking their response on these sensitive issues broached perhaps for the first time.
In a letter to all chief ministers written a few days back, Law Commission chairman Justice B S Chauhan (retd) has urged them to “encourage” the various stakeholders in their states such as minority groups, political parties, NGOs, civil society initiatives and even government departments and agencies to share their views and interact with the panel.
In an appeal issued along with the consultation paper, the Commission had said the objective behind the endeavour is to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices.
It has assured the people that the “norms of no one class, group or community will dominate the tone and tenor of family law reforms”."

Bai Tahira, Fuzlunbi, Zohra Khatoon, Shah Bano, Shamim Ara, Iqbal Bano, Khatoon Nisa, Shabana Bano, Shamima Farooqui. This is not a list of female Muslim names taken from Wikipedia but hapless victims of the Muslim law on “triple divorce” who have, since 1976, fought legal cases right up to the Supreme Court to secure measly amounts of money for their sustenance. The stories of their miseries are etched in the pages of the law reports of India.
The latest among the countless Muslim women in the country suffering the pang of “talaq, talaq, talaq” is Saira Bano, who is now before the apex court. Instead of traditionally invoking judicial mercy of ordering the divorcing husband to pay her maintenance, she has boldly challenged the constitutional validity of his action of kicking her out by using the so-called triple divorce formula. Entertaining her plea on February 29, the court has sought the government’s response.
The practice of talaq was most certainly not introduced by Islam; it was rampant in the Arab society of the time and Islam tried to gradually reform in a very humane way. There is nothing in the law of Islam that suggests that the husband is free to pronounce talaq in an irrational or unreasonable manner. It allows talaq, subject to several conditions that are of a dissuasive nature, their purpose being to discourage

the husband from exercising his right without careful consideration.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Quran enjoins men not to act in haste and to coolly think before deciding on talaq, since “you may dislike something about your wife but, maybe, God has put in her some good for you.” There is nothing in the holy book that shows this provision is discretionary.
Just like nikah, talaq too is not just a word the mere utterance of which will terminate the marriage, but a procedure which must be meticulously followed. Only if all the prescribed steps of this procedure have been duly undertaken will a marriage be dissolved. Unfortunately, traditional interpreters of Muslim law give effect to a talaq pronounced by a man even in sheer violation of the true Islamic law and procedure for divorce, calling it talaq-ul-bidat (innovative divorce). According to them, a talaq-ul-bidat is “sinful but effective” — a strange proposition rendered into English as “bad in theology but good in law.”
If, after pronouncing a talaq-ul-bidat, a husband wants to reunite with his divorced wife, a wholly unlawful practice, based on a very distorted view of the concept of halala, is to be followed. Halala is, in fact, a concept very different from what it is erroneously believed to be. The rule takes care of the rare eventuality of a thrice-divorced woman remarrying but ending up with a failed marriage once again. It is certainly not meant to force a divorced woman to suffer the indignity of sleeping for a while with someone else before returning to the man who has inflicted on her the cruelty of unilateral talaq not recognised by the Quran. Halala, as practised in India, is clearly repugnant

to the fundamental duty of citizens to “renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women” under Article 51A of the Constitution of India.
The laws in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, the UAE and Yemen have totally derecognised the concepts of triple talaq and halala. It is high time India followed suit and saved countless Muslim families from devastation. The judiciary must act in the matter as no legislative reform seems possible.
If Saira Bano’s plea, now before the Supreme Court, is accepted, there will be nothing “un-Islamic” about it. On the contrary, the court would be enforcing the true Islamic law on divorce and answering the Quran’s call for absolute justice and fairness in society."

Striking a defiant posture on the contentious issue of triple talaq, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) today asserted that it had the “constitutional” right to implement Muslim personal law. On the Babri Masjid issue, AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani said the board would accept the Supreme Court’s decision on the matter while stressing that “no outside settlement was acceptable”.
On the talaq issue, he said that the board has decided to issue a code of conduct and warned that those who give talaq (divorce) without ‘Sharia’ (Islamic law) reasons will face social boycott.

“A code of conduct for talaq is being issued. With its help, the real picture of Shariat directives will be brought out on the talaq issue. If talaq is given without Shariat reasons, those involved will be socially boycotted,” Rehmani told reporters here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The board is issuing appeals to all maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday ‘namaz’ and emphasise on its implementation, he said.
The Board has made it clear that it will not tolerate any interference in the Shariat laws, and claimed that majority of the Muslims in the country do not want any change in their personal law.
Rehmani had earlier said that in the recent signature campaign initiated by the AIMPLB across the country, both men and women have said that the Constitution of India guarantees them the provision to practice their own religion.
He had also urged that no roadblocks should be put in the implementation of the personal laws.
The Union government had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to advocate that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

BJP and RSS have raked up issues like Uniform Civil Code and triple talaq to “polarise the country” by making Hindus and Muslims fight each other, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said here today. The leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha asked the BJP-led Central government to let Muslims decide on the matter of ‘talaq’.
“The BJP and RSS want to make Hindus and Muslims fight each other. Issues like triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code are being discussed and debated on television channels. This (TV debates) is not being down due to any sympathy (for Muslim women), rather done to polarise the country through a well-planned strategy,” he said addressing a conference of Scheduled Caste and Minorities.

“Their (BJP-RSS) strategy is to make Muslims fight Muslims on triple talaq while Hindus fight Muslims on Uniform Civil Code. Let the matter of talaq be decided by the minorities themselves,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Azad, who inaugurated the conference organised by Bihar Congress, claimed that BJP and RSS were raising these matters to divert attention from issues plaguing common people like price rise, unemployment, bringing back black money etc.
He dubbed the BJP government’s regime worse than the British Raj, saying the latter never inspected the fridge or kitchen of an individual to check meat and or see what one ate in a university.
“Senior leaders of BJP always say that there is a Jungle Raj in Bihar. But today the ‘law of jungle’ is prevailing in the country under NDA regime,” he said.
People had been safe during the Congress regimes in states and at the Centre, but today they, specially dalits and minorities, are unsafe and insecure, he added. Commenting on the unrest in the Valley, the former Union minister said, “It is 101 days since the curfew was imposed in Kashmir. We have not seen such a long curfew anywhere in the world.”
The curfew was lifted across Kashmir on October 15. However, the unrest triggered by the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces in July, entered 101st day today.
“15.50 lakh children have not gone to schools since then. Buses are not plying. Tourism received a setback as no one goes there. But these things are not being discussed on TV or newspapers,” Azad said.
Meanwhile, Bihar Congress chief Ashok Choudhary asked Dalits and minorities to come together to give strength to their voice as they share common problems.
He also read out party vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s message appealing to Dalits and minorities to fight against RSS and BJP unitedly.
Mohammad Wali Rahmani, Amir-e-Shariat of social organisation Imarat-e-Shariah Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand, alleged that BJP has adopted the British policy of “divide and rule” by raking up such issues.
Congress needs to fight the BJP and RSS if it seeks to return to power, he said.
Congress Legislature Party leader Sadanand Singh moved a 16-point demand in the form of a resolution, which talked about increasing the reservation cap of Scheduled Castes from 16 per cent to 22 per cent, as the number of castes in the category has increased over the years."

With the third phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections closing in, the war of words continues between the major players in the state. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joined the campaign trail for the first time and took the opportunity to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally in Rae Bareli attacking him over his claims that Uttar Pradesh had ‘adopted’ him. She said that the state had no dearth of youth for an outsider to help its development. She joined her brother and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi at the rally.

Referring to Modi’s remarks claiming that he’s a son of Varanasi and a son of Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said: “…a thought came to my mind, does UP need to adopt an outsider?”
“PM had said UP has adopted him and that he will look after UP’s development. Does UP need to adopt anyone to look after its development?” Priyanka Gandhi said at the rally, adding: “Is there no youth here that can take UP forward? Each youth here has the potential to become a politician and work for the development of UP… every one has that hope.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rahul Gandhi also attacked the Prime Minister over his statements, saying that relationships don’t develop just by talking but by nurturing.
“He (Modi) makes relationships wherever he goes…He went to Varanasi and termed Ganga as his mother and said he was the son of Varanasi…In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, he promised to change Varanasi,” he added.
Both brother and sister also attacked Modi over ‘hollow promises’, with Priyanka Gandhi saying he has done nothing for Varanasi.
“Nothing but rhetoric by Modi government. PM has done nothing for his constituency Varanasi, he made hollow promises,” said Priyanka Gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi further criticised him over the same saying that the Modi government has not done enough for the poor and the farmers. He further put out the demands of the farmer saying,”Waive off farmers’ loans, slash electricity bill by half and give right price for produce.”
In another rally at Fatehpur, the Congress Vice President, using a Bollywood reference, took a jibe at PM Modi’s ‘achhe din’ promise and said that when people were expecting Shah Rukh Khan’s Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, people got Gabbar Singh from Sholay.
“Prime Minister Modi promised us Achhe Din. We were shown Dilwale Dulhania the movie. 2.5 years later, we saw Gabbar Singh come out,” he said.

Samajwadi Party leader Dimple Yadav too joined in the criticism of the Prime Minister slamming the Modi’s poll promise to waive off farmer’s loan.

BSP supremo Mayawati joined the chorus of voices attacking PM Modi over his ‘adopted son’ remarks and said that despite his ‘drama’ over it, the people of Uttar Pradesh would never vote the BJP into power.

She further added that the ongoing feud in the Samajwadi Party will only harm Akhilesh Yadav and his team.

UNION MINISTER for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said that triple talaq is a major issue in Uttar Pradesh and that non-BJP parties were keeping mum on it for vote bank politics. He termed triple talaq as a practice of harassment. In reference to a triple talaq case pending in the Supreme Court, Prasad told reporters here that the court has sought the central government’s stand on the issue.
He said that triple talaq was not a question of religion, but one related to dignity, justice and equality for women. He said it was not acceptable that a section of women get harassed after 70 years of freedom.

(A PTI report quoted Prasad as saying at a press conference in Ghaziabad on Saturday, “The government may take a major step to ban triple talaq after the UP Assembly polls…. We are the only party which respects women. Neither do other parties offer a good place to women nor do they respect them.”)https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Prasad said the BJP has regard for every faith and religion but every pernicious practice cannot become a part of religion.
He said that 20 Islamic countries, including Egypt, Afghanistan and Pakistan, have either completely stopped the practice of triple talaq or have controlled it.
He said when control on the practice was not considered against Sharia in these Islamic countries, then how can a discussion to control it could be against Sharia in a secular country such as India.
The BJP in its manifesto has promised that if it comes to power in UP, its government will take the opinion of Muslim women on the issue and present it before the Supreme Court.
Prasad asked Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati to spell out their stand on triple talaq and on the question of dignity, justice and equality for women.
“They will never take opinion because politics of appeasement is dominating,” he said.
When asked whether such an opinion was being taken in other BJP-ruled states, Prasad said in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the state governments were clearly against triple talaq."

WITH THE Centre celebrating the birth centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya as ‘Garib Kalyan Varsha’, the Adityanath government has asked its officials to suggest new schemes and projects, which can be launched in his name between May to September. Upadhyaya’s birth anniversary falls on September 25. In a directive, the government has asked departments to keep in mind Upadhyaya’s idea of ‘Antyodaya’ (uplifting the last person in the queue or the system), while submitting their suggestions. Officials have also been asked to suggest publicity ideas, which can take his thoughts forward.
While the state information department has been made the nodal agency to execute the plan, it has been asked to keep in mind the birthplace of Upadhyaya — Nagla Chandrabhan village in Mathura — while proposing events to mark his anniversary. Departments have been asked to chalk out programmes and schemes that could be organised and executed at the district level.

While Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma is heading the committee, the other members included Urban Development Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, Culture and Religious Affairs Ministers Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, Sports and Youth Welfare Minister Chetan Chauhan and Rural Development Minister Mahendra Singh.
Sources in the government said the first meeting of the committee is scheduled to take place on April 27 or 28. The departments have been asked to be suggest their ideas about the schemes and programmes before this.
When contacted, Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary said: “Programmes of public welfare will be organised in every district to propagate the ideology of Deendayal Upadhyaya. All departments will be part of these programmes.”
“Through these programmes, the government will send out a message that it was working according to Upadhyaya’s ideology to ensure that benefit of schemes reach every person in the society. Those from the poor and deprived sections will be made beneficiaries in welfare schemes to bring them into the mainstream,” said an official.
From April 24 to September 25, state BJP will hold seminars on triple talaq, create a directory of blood donors as well as organise sports competitions, programmes by young singers, writers, painters and musicians. Health camps for women and career counselling sessions for students in villages will also be organised. Besides, veteran leaders associated with the party since Jan Sangh will be felicitated, general knowledge competitions will be held in schools and Garib Kalyan Mela will be organised where stalls will be put up on welfare schemes of the state and central governments.Lucknow NewsClose aide of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari held in ambulance case‘Abducted’ Aligarh girl found living on rent in BulandshahrCovid resurgence: With nearly 4,000 cases a day, patient count climbs to 22,820Click here for more

Hailing the Allahabad High Court’s observation on ‘triple talaq’, BJP today said its stand on the issue has been vindicated, and asked political parties supporting the practise to “desist from dividing the society in the name of religion”. “BJP’s ideology of gender equality stands vindicated by the court’s observation which has termed triple talaq unconstitutional and violative of women rights. A progressive society cannot be subjected to a regressive religious practise.

“BJP welcomes the court’s decision and also warns those political parties who have supported triple talaq for their political expediency. Time has come for them to desist from dividing the society in the name of religion. No personal law can claim supremacy over the rights granted to individuals by the Constitution,” BJP National Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh said.
Expressing anguish over Muslim women being subjected to divorce over speed post, Skype and Facebook under the practice, he said it amounted to “disrespect towards women”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“India is one and the rights of women need to be one. Gender equality will be a major election issue, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, because time has come that people of India should know how these ‘secular parties’ have played with women rights through vote bank politics,” Singh said.
Coming down heavily on the practise of “triple talaq”, the Allahabad High Court today held that this form of “instant divorce” was “cruel” and “most demeaning” which “impedes and drags India from becoming a nation”."

For the first time, the AIPMLB has come around to addressing the issue in right earnest. It will peruse the draft document, based on recommendations of the National Commission for Women (NCW), to stop Muslim men from resorting to instant triple talaq (pronouncing divorce three times together at one instance to divorce a woman).
In addition, the AIPMLB meet will also initiate revolutionary changes in Muslim marriage law, sources discolsed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Once the draft gets the AIPMLB’s expected nod, it will signal the end of a long-standing tradition still being zealously preserved by some Muslim groups.
According to scholars, the original Islamic law (Shari’a) does not provide for such talaq. The practice of triple talaq was originally supposed to be used only in extreme situations.
The practice, however, was gradually allowed to be a tool for instant divorce, despite the Koran and Hadith explicitly ordering abundant caution and patience before divorcing. It had deteriorated to the level of many Muslim men effecting divorce without a notice or even without the presence of the wife herself.
A divorced or widowed Muslim woman faces other disadvantages too. A man can remarry soon after divorce or death of his wife but women have to complete the period iddat (four months and 10 days) for remarrying. If she was pregnant, the iddat period would extend till delivery.
The NCW report based on hearings all over the country on the status of minority women has indicated that the liberal provisions of divorce in Islamic law was being misused by many men just to oppress women. The report said that the stories of divorce and consequent sufferings are similar all over the country — only the people involved are different.
The NCW suggested that the Board make amendments to the Muslim marriage law so that the suffering of women was reduced. The Board considered the proposals and consulted various interest groups before deciding to put it up for discussion at its Bangalore meeting.
The backdrop to the nation-wide controversies over talaq had evolved during the Shah Bano case. In 1985, Shah Bano, aged 75, appealed to the Supreme Court for maintenance against her former husband, Mohamed Ahamed Khan. It was a rare case of a Muslim woman daring to take on the prevailing community system. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 was its fallout, which too courted controversy.
The NCW report has requested the Board to adopt a standard and foolproof nikahnama (marriage contract) and enforce it as a mandatory requirement for all Muslim marriages. The reasoning of the NCW was that a nikahnama, if proper and available, could be used as a proof in case of divorce litigation.
It has also underscored that existing nikahnamas are dubious and difficult to enforce, which a majority of married Muslim women would never see in their lifetime. This was in spite of the fact that Islamic law prescribes that marriage is a contract and both parties should have access to the contract document.
A contract presupposes that either party involved can divorce or seek other proper remedy if preferred. “But, it rarely happens the other way. The inherent power structure remains tilted against women” according to scholars requesting anonymity.
A suitably formulated draft nikahnama, which the AIMPLB had referred to various Mulsim outfits, is also to be discussed at its Bangalore meeting. Sources said that women members of the Board have also demanded implementation of a proper format for nikahnama.
The NCW report had underlined that a proper nikahnama was not a new concept. Several Muslim organisations and scholars like Maulana Asharaf Ali Thanavi (1936), Dr Mohammed Iqbal (1939) had suggested it. The Islamic Fiqh Academy too had proposed a proper and enforceable format for nikahnama in 1995.
The draft document also provide rights to women for divorce in the following instances: Husband’s whereabouts are not known for two years; husband refuses to provide maintenance for one year; husband becomes of unsound mind; the spouses are separated for one year; the husband suffers virulent venereal diseases or treats the wife cruelly.
The report also affirms that mehr (dower) and maintenance form part of personal law of Muslims but they were not recognised as important by men. The qazi (clerics) are forced by Muslim men to record a meagre mehr amount, to escape from paying maintenance. The draft also include rules for assuring adequate mehr and maintenance, sources added.
Sources in the AIMPLB said that there would invariably be some changes in the draft put up for discussion at the meeting. “But if it gets the green signal even with some changes, it would be a landmark event in the history of Indian Muslims”, they observed."

A newly-wed Muslim woman has divorced her husband by saying talaq thrice over the phone after her in-laws allegedly demanded a car in dowry. The incident has taken place at Daha village in UP’s Baghpat district.
The local Panchayat has approved the triple talaq and slapped a fine of Rs 2.75 lakh on the woman’s in-laws. Her husband’s family has paid the fine to the woman’s family. “My husband demanded a car within two hours of our marriage.I divorced him instead of fulfilling his demand. Other girls should take the same step ,” said Mohsina.
The woman was married to Arif, who hails from a nearby village, on July 21. Mohsina alleged that the demand for the car was raised soon after she reached her in-laws’ place. She then called her mother to her in-laws’ place who tried to reason with her daughter’s in-laws, but failed.
The issue went to the local Panchayat, which met on July 24. Village headman Sushil Rana said Mohsina was willing to live with her husband, but he was adamant on the demand. Eventually, Mohsina said talaq thrice over the phone and Arif followed suit, said Rana."

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, defending the validity of triple talaq before the Supreme Court, has said that if the practice is discontinued, a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her.
“If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive,” stated the AIMPLB’s affidavit, submitted in court Friday.
The board also said that divorce proceedings instead of triple talaq could damage a woman’s chances of re-marriage if the husband indicts her of loose character in court.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Granting a husband the right to divorce indirectly provides security to the wife. Marriage is a contract in which both parties are not physically equal. Male is stronger and female weaker sex. Man is not dependent on woman for his protection. On the contrary, she needs him for her defence,” stated the affidavit, adding that triple talaq wards off the possibility of a rise in murders of women whose husbands want to divorce them.
The AIMPLB asked the Supreme Court to keep its hands off the issue, saying that principles of marriage, talaq and polygamy are interwoven with religious and cultural rights of Muslims, which cannot be touched upon by any court on the ground of violation of fundamental rights.
“Personal laws of a community cannot be rewritten in the name of social reform,” said the affidavit, settled by senior advocates Yusuf Hatim Muchhala and Huzefa A Ahmadi. It also asserted that Article 44, which envisaged a Uniform Civil Code, was only a Directive Principle of State Policy, but was not enforceable.
Advocating polygamy, the AIMPLB said that polygamy was a “social need” and a “blessing” for women because “an unlawful mistress is more harmful for social fabric than a lawful second wife”. The affidavit argued that the death rate of men was higher since it was mostly men who died in accidents, and since women outnumbered men, not permitting polygamy would force women “into leading a spinster’s life”.
“Polygamy ensures sexual purity and chastity and whenever polygamy has been banned, it emerges from history that illicit sex has raised its head,” stated the affidavit. It added that if polygamy is not allowed, a man would divorce an ailing wife, or he might have an extra-marital relationship.
“In all above instances, polygamy is a blessing, not a curse for women… polygamy is the solution to the problem of divorced women and widows. Women should appreciate this point that if the ratio of women is higher, would they prefer wedlock for fellow women, or let them be illicit mistresses of men, without any of the rights which a wife gets,” said the AIMPLB, citing some surveys to claim that Muslims have the lowest rate of polygamy in India.
It also blamed “communal” organisations for running a propaganda regarding prevalence of polygamy among Muslims to instil fear in the majority community.
The affidavit called it “rather strange” that a law that recognises live-in relationships without marriage worthy of protection should frown upon a relationship which is formalised by the sanctity of marriage.
The board claimed that Muslim Personal Law, based on the Quran, adequately provided for the rights of Muslim women and formed part of the issue of freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion guaranteed under Article 25 and 26 read with Article 29 of the Constitution of India.
It stated that although pronouncement of triple talaq in one go was “undesirable and irregular”, various Islamic jurists and religious scholars have unanimously agreed that the effect of triple talaq in one go was that it effectively terminated the marriage. Also, even if divorce was pronounced irregularly without any valid reason, the affidavit said, it would still result in termination of marriage.
The AIMPLB sought dismissal of a PIL by a Muslim woman, who has challenged the validity of instantaneous and unilateral pronouncement of triple talaq, apart from a ban on polygamy. It is on her petition that the board was asked by a bench, led by Chief Justice T S Thakur, to submit its response."

Describing ‘triple talaq’ as anti-constitutional and anti-civilisation, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said its time the country should abolish this “gender discrimination”, in the light of principles of justice, dignity and equality.

“Triple talaq is anti-constitutional, against law, against the principles of democracy and anti-civilisation. This kind of opinion is on the rise. There is a discussion going on, on this subject. Already so much of time has been taken. It is time the country should move forward to abolish ‘triple talaq’ to end the discrimination and also have gender justice and equality before law. We should end this,” Naidu told reporters.
“Even Muslim women are demanding justice. There should not be any gender discrimination. There should be gender justice. All are equal before the Constitution,” he said speaking here on the sidelines of a programme organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
He suggested that as the Supreme Court is currently scrutinising the issue, anybody can go and voice their concerns.
On the Uniform Civil Code, he said, “the government will do everything in a transparent manner. It will take Parliament into confidence. Some sections are resorting to a false propaganda that the government is trying to implement Common Civil Code from backdoor.”
On October 7, the Centre for the first time, had opposed in Supreme Court the practise of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a re-look on the grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, referred to constitutional principles such as gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
The law panel’s move was significant as the Supreme Court had recently said it would prefer a wider debate, in public as well as in court, before taking a decision on the constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, which many complain is abused by Muslim men to arbitrarily divorce their wives."

BJP on Tuesday accused BSP supremo Mayawati of pursuing vote bank politics after she attacked the Modi government over its opposition to the practise of ‘triple talaq’ in the Muslim community. “It is unfortunate and ironical that despite being a woman Mayawati is not standing for the rights of Muslim women. She is doing so for vote bank politics,” its National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said.
With Samajwadi Party facing a grave internal crisis, Mayawati is aggressively wooing Muslims, a traditional SP support base, as their support to her party has the potential to prosper it to power in the assembly polls scheduled for early next year.
BJP had accused her of “communalising” the elections after she appealed to the community to vote for her party.
“BJP and its government led by Narendra Modi has now started a new controversy over Muslim personal law, triple talaq and common civil code before the Assembly elections in some states to serve its petty politics. BSP strongly condemns it,” Mayawati had said in a statement earlier in the day."

Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad Sunday said the NDA government was trying to divert attention from its “failures” by raking up issues like Uniform Civil Code and triple talaq. He also claimed that the “secular political parties and the media” had become “tools” by following the government’s agenda.
“I mean we are taking forward their agenda, their path and I will advise both media as well as secular parties that we should not fall prey to the political agenda of the NDA,” Azad told reporters at the AICC headquarters after announcing the induction of Maulana Obaidullah Khan Azmi, a three-time Rajya Sabha MP, into the party. Khan, who hails from Azamgarh, was with the JD(U) earlier.
Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government of having failed to deliver their election promises, Azad said “they have now decided to entangle and mislead the people in such issues”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“So that we keep discussing these issues round the clock.

Talking to The Indian Express later, Khan Azmi said the concept of triple talaq was being misused by some, but the course correction had to come from within and not by a law."

A prominent Muslim body on Tuesday vehemently opposed the scrutiny of the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy by the Supreme Court, saying it would amount to “judicial legislation” and personal laws cannot be challenged on the ground that they violate fundamental rights. All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), in a fresh affidavit, rubbished the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government that the apex court should re-look these practices as they are violative of fundamental right like gender equality and the ethos of secularism, a key part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

Stoutly defending the prevalent practice in the community, AIMPLB Secretary Mohammed Fazlurrahim said “if this court proceeds to examine questions of Muslim personal laws and lays down special rules for Muslim women in matters concerning marriage, divorce and maintenance, it would amount to judicial legislation and will be violative of doctrine of separation of powers.”
ALSO READ: A practice against modernityhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
AIMPLB has listed out grounds for its opposition to the judicial scrutiny of the practices. The questions raised in the petition are matters of “legislative policy” and, moreover, personal laws cannot be challenged as being violative of fundamental rights like right to equality under the Constitution, the affidavit said.
It also said the personal laws of Muslims cannot be “re-written in the name of social reform” and these practices are protected under Article 25, 26 and 29 (freedom to practice religion) of the Constitution. Opposing the Law Commission’s fresh endeavour on Uniform Civil Code, the body said it pertained to the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution and hence “not enforceable”.
ALSO READ: Triple talaq: Personal laws should comply with Constitution, says Arun Jaitley
Highlighting importance of religious scriptures, AIMPLB said the courts “cannot supplant its own interpretations over the text of scriptures” in a situation where “unique importance” has been attached to such texts. Government, for the first time, has opposed the practice and said, “the issue of validity of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy needs to be considered in the light of principles of gender justice and the overriding principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality.”
AIMPLB referred to a 2002 judgement in which the apex court had dealt with the issue of talaq and placed “explicit measures to check” the practice by laying down the test of “reasonable cause” and “prior reconciliation”. Opposing the reopening of the issues, the 69-page

affidavit said there were adequate remedies available to Muslim women under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the Muslim Women (Protection of rights on Divorce) Act.
It maintained that Muslim personal law provided for the practices to be followed on the issues of “marriage, divorce and maintenance” and were based on “holy scriptures – Al Quran and sources based on Al Quran”. It elaborated on the aspect that personal laws cannot be challenged on the ground that they are violative of fundamental rights under the Constitution. “Personal laws do not derive their validity on the ground that they have been passed or made by a legislature or other competent authority. The foundational sources of personal law are their respective scriptural texts.
“The Mohammedan Law is founded essentially on the Holy Quran and sources based on the Holy Quran and thus it cannot fall within the purview of the expression ‘laws in force’ as mentioned in Article 13 of the Constitution of India, and hence its validity cannot be tested on a challenge based on Part III (which deals with fundamental rights) of the Constitution,” the affidavit said. Personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reform, it said, adding, “the institution of marriage is differently looked upon by different religions, and consequently the issues of marriage, divorce and maintenance are dealt with in different manners by different religions.
“While one community might be prepared to accept and work social reform, another community may not be prepared for it.” “In any event, even while bringing in such a social reform, it is not permissible to change the entire practice or acts done in pursuance of such religion,” it said. “It is submitted that the issue of Muslim Personal Law is a cultural issue which is inextricably interwoven with religion of Islam. Thus, it is the issue of freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion guaranteed under Article 25 and 26 read with Article 29 of the Constitution,” the affidavit said.
The Muslim body supported the practice of granting right to divorce to husbands and said “all jurists unanimously agree that husband has the right to divorce. No jurist in Islamic history ever held a view to the contrary”. “Shariah grants the right to divorce to husband because men have greater power of decision making. They are more likely to control emotions and not take a hasty decision,” it claimed.
Supporting the practice of triple talaq, AIMPLB said that entrusting the responsibility of divorce entirely to court would increase the burden on judiciary. It further listed out certain disadvantages like delay in grant of divorce through judicial means. “Granting husband the right to divorce indirectly provides security to wife. Marriage is a contract in which both the parties are not physically equal. Male is stronger and female weaker sex. Man is not dependent upon woman for his protection. On the contrary, she needs him for her defence.
“If there develops serious discord between the couple and husband does not at all want to live with her, legal compulsions of time consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course….,” the affidavit said. The AIMPLB also said that the court should not thrust its views while dealing with religious questions. “Constitutional scheme clearly provides that judiciary which is one of the important organs of the State shall not lay down religion for any religious denomination or section thereof and whenever the Court is confronted with any religious issues, it will look to the religious books of a particular denomination held sacred by it.
“In other words, there is no scope for the Court to import its own views while dealing with religious questions or scriptures or beliefs of any religious denomination,” it said. It also said the sources of Muslim Personal law have been “approved and endorsed by Holy Quran and the practices of marriage, divorce and maintenance are based on such sources all of which flow from the Holy Quran itself”.
AIMPLB said though several leading Islamic jurists have opined that pronouncement of triple talaq in one go is “undesirable and irregular”, they have unanimously agreed that the effect of this is that it “effectively terminates the marriage”. “In addition to the above, it is pertinent to point out that it is a misconception that Triple Talaq is always a result of haste and is a power which is freely misused by a Muslim male.
“In fact, over the years, the practice in the community is such that usually the families of the spouses intervene in case of any marital discord and only when all attempts of reconciliation fail and when the spouses want instant dissolution, does the male resort to usage of Triple Talaq,” it said. Dealing with the practice of polygamy, it submitted that the Quran, Hadith and the consensus view allow Muslim men to have up to four wives.
“Though polygamy is permitted, it is not obligatory or desirable, rather, jurists regard monogamy as a better practice in usual conditions. However, Polygamy meets social and moral needs and the provision for it stems from concern and sympathy for women,” it said. Prior to this, the Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants,

religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
The apex court had also taken suo motu cognisance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in cases of divorce or due to other marriages of their husbands and a bench headed by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur is examining the issue. Subsequently, various other petitions including one by triple talaq victim Shayara Bano were filed challenging the age-old practice of ‘triple talaq’ among the Muslim community."

While the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is still struggling to find its Chief Minister candidate in Uttar Pradesh, the newly elected MLAs here are already prepared to table their proposals in the first assembly session. In one of such proposals, BJP MLA from Deoband, Brijesh Singh revealed that he will get the name of his constituency changed to ‘Dev Vrand’ as the town is more famous for its links to the Maharabharat than Darul Uloom Deoband, the Islamic school where the Deobandi Islamic movement has its roots.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Singh said: “Deoband is just a perception as this town is always famous as Dev Vrand only. We have Mahabharat’s Rankhandi here and the five Pandavas have worshiped here in Dev Vrand. Even the village named as Jarwala is actually Yakshawala and is the same place where ‘Yaksha’ has questioned Yudhisthir.”
Deoband is one of the five constituencies in Saharanpur district of North UP. With a population of 65 per cent Muslims, the region is home to one of the earliest Islamic revivalist movements in India. The newly elected BJP MLA, Brijest Singh defeated Majid Ali of BSP with 29,415 votes and secured 1,02,000 votes from Deoband. Singh, who made the announcement during a ‘Holi Milan’ event, also claimed that a majority of Muslim women have voted for him as they are happy with the government’s stance on the triple talaq issue. The MLA also claimed that he would not have won by such a huge margin had they not voted for him. “Meri Muslim behne Modi ji ke sath hai aur woh bhi chahti hain ki teen Talaq band ho,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Deobandi movement began a decade after the 1857 revolt against the British colonial rule in India. Founded by Islamic scholar Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, the movement was based on the rationale that the downfall of the Mughal empire was a punishment meted out to the Muslim community for having strayed from the true path of Islam. The religious seminary created by the founders of the movement, Darul Uloom Deoband, located in Deoband, propagates Islamic science and jurisprudence.
Since 2002, the Deoband constituency has been the stronghold of either the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party. Before that, the BJP had come to power twice, first in the 1993 elections and then in 1996. Earlier, Deoband was a stronghold of the Congress since the first elections in 1951. In 2017, BJP’s emphatic victory can be pinned down to the division of Muslim votes between the SP and the BSP, resulting in the saffron party’s victory."

This adverse reaction of the media is because the Congress does not want to be a victim of misunderstanding and is trying, on a war footing, to convert its unpopularity into popularity through a campaign led by Prashant Kishore. According to unbiased sources, these sabhas are getting a good response. The reason for this is the restlessness of farmers against the Central government which is turning a blind eye to their problems. Rahul Gandhi is raising very sensitive questions that are touching the hearts of the people. What he gains by such a campaign remains to be seen. But going by the reaction of the pro-BJP media, his campaign has created a stir in the corridors of power.”
Triple talaq debate
Endorsing the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court by the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) with regard to “triple talaq”, the daily Siasat, in its editorial on September 4, writes: “In 1985 when, in the Shah Bano case, maintenance was granted to a divorced Muslim woman by the Supreme Court, the Muslim Women’s Act, 1986, was enacted after protests from Muslims. Now, the case of a victim of domestic violence, Shaira Bano, has provided the communal media with an opportunity to launch massive propaganda (against Muslim Personal Law) using this case. By linking a case of domestic violence with talaaq-e-salaasa (triple talaq), the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and other women’s organisations have moved the real issue to the background. If a Muslim woman is a victim of domestic violence, it is seen in the light of divorce or talaq. When a Hindu woman is a victim of domestic violence, it is considered in a different manner. This is an attempt to provide an effective pretext to the Central government — working under the influence of RSS — to declare the uniform civil code as a pressing need.The fundamental principle connected with Islamic teachings is obvious to everyone: No change can be made in the system and laws of the Shariat. The stand that the AIMPLB has taken from the beginning, keeping this principle in view, has the support not only of Muslims but also of moderate members of other communities. Muslims themselves have no right to bring about any change or amendment in these laws. The government should understand that Muslims are bound by the Shariat. Talks of enforcing a uniform civil code are thus nothing but a regrettable effort to disrupt the communal harmony in the country.”
Salar, the influential daily published from Bengaluru, Hubli and Gulbarga, in its editorial on September 3, writes: “There is a need to create consciousness about the rights given to minorities in the Indian Constitution (Article 24 and 29), and about Muslim Personal Law, and strengthen the hands of AIMPLB devoted to protection and defence of Muslim Personal Law since 1972”.
What is sedition?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Jadeed Khabar, in its editorial on September 9, writes: “The Supreme Court, in a recent judgement, declined to accept criticism of the government as sedition, saying that it could be sedition only if a certain statement or action leads to violence. It referred to an SC judgement from 1962 in a case wherein one Kedarnath Singh, on May 26, 1952, had said to villagers in Barauni in Bihar that when they throw out the British, they should also target Congress goondas and throw them out because these Congress elements were sucking the blood of the labourers and farmers. The SC bench headed by Justice B.P. Satya dismissed the case of sedition against Kedarnath Singh. It said that a criticism of the government with the objective of improving the condition of lives of the people was not sedition. This was part of the freedom of expression.”
Inquilab, in its editorial on September 8, writes: “Even though during Congress rule there were numerous instances of people charged with sedition, under the current BJP rule, the law against sedition is being wrongly interpreted and used as a political weapon, whether it is against Hardik Patel or JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar and his associates.”
Sahafat, in its editorial on September 7, writes that some newspapers, especially Hindi papers, have described “sedition” as “ghaddari”, that is absolutely wrong.” “Sedition” (baghaawat) is not “treason” (ghaddari)."

I didn’t choose this date for the book launch. When I rang up I M Kadri of Nehru Centre, Mumbai, he told me that that was the only date available in the next two months. Then I contacted Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh and Mahrashtra’s Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. Not only did they promise, but also thrice confirmed that they would be there. Sadly, they couldn’t make it. They all had to be in Delhi for a meeting. I was reminded of a couplet by late Ali Sardar Jafri: ‘‘Is shor-e-siyasat se khamosh chalaja/ Jinki hai yahaan dhoom woh kam yaad rahenge.’’ (Pass quietly by this hustle-bustle of politics/ The once popular in this field will be less remembered).

• At the release, journalist M J Akbar differed with you as well as Goolam Vahanvati, Solicitor General of India, on the question of Muslims being in the mainstream.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It’s not a question of disagreement. Akbar gave the issue a different direction. He said Muslims were themselves mainstream. That’s an entirely different approach. You can’t have different mainstreams in the same country.

• So you believe that Muslims are out of the mainstream?
What I and Vahanvati emphasised was that Muslims need to become part of the mainstream. The fear that they will lose their identity if they join the mainstream is absurd. Akbar also refused to accept that Muslims were a minority. He said numbers didn’t matter as empowerment decided who was a minority and who wasn’t. Akbar said the Brahmins never felt they were a minority. True, the Brahmins are small in number, but they are powerful. But we shouldn’t forget that they are part of the Hindu religion. More than the Brahmins, the Parsis, a microscopic minority, have uplifted themselves and are dominant everywhere. Without confronting with the Hindus, they harnessed their energies, utilised the opportunities. I have always appealed to the Muslims to do the same. Confrontation brought disaster, before Partition and after it.

• You are very critical of the Muslim leadership.
The Muslim leadership has miserably failed in its duty. Both Sir Syed and the poet Iqbal told the community to embrace new education. Iqbal stirred his community: ‘‘Aaine nau se darna tarze kohan pe arna/ Manzil yehi kathin hai qaumon ki zindagi mein’’ (To fear the new rules and to be adamant about old mores/ These are the obstacles in the path of communities). I tell the same to the Muslims. Look at the Jews. No race was so persecuted for centuries as the Jews were in Europe. And then they told themselves that they had no friends, no well-wishers. They bounced back on their own. Today, they dominate every sector. Most of the Nobel prize winners are Jews. I believe the Muslims can do the same. They have that capacity. I feel that Indian Muslims can lead the Muslims of the world.

• In your book, you have likened Al Qaeda to the modern army of Halaku, the medieval marauders.
The so-called jihadis have done the greatest damage to Islam. Except for Hassan al-Sabbah who created assassins in the 11th century, no Muslim approved of terrorist activities. Even then, Imam Ghazali, a scholar, told Muslims: ‘‘If you don’t destroy these terrorists, they will destroy you.’’ It’s a very misguided movement.

• Some ulema don’t want to get rid of triple talaq.
How can you justify it when the Quran clearly lays down the ways to give talaq? It says that first efforts should be made for reconciliation between  husband and wife by an arbitrator. In the second stage, further efforts should be made, and then, if nothing works, talaq becomes the final solution. Triple talaq contradicts the message of Islam.

• A member of the Muslim Personal Law Board has suggested family planning for Muslims. Do you agree?
I welcome this move. Nowhere is it written that Muslims should have many kids. Somewhere, some mad mullahs say something, and the media highlights it.

• Some Muslims accuse you of being soft on Hindutva.
This is the biggest lie. It’s I who responded to the canard against Islam by the likes of Arun Shourie, Vidia Naipaul and Salman Rushdie. When Balasaheb Thackeray told Time that he wanted to throw the Muslims into the Arabian Sea, I told him: ‘‘But Balasaheb, Muslims will swim back.’’ He laughed and said, ‘‘Yes, we all should live in peace.’’

• So you believe unity will finally replace the discord?
Yes. There’s no other option."
"1617716977-20","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","Ban the triple talaq, it’s a sin","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/ban-the-triple-talaq-its-a-sin/","Ban the triple talaq, it’s a sin","June 17, 2004","Recently, several cases of instant triple divorce have been reported. In Bihar, just because a woman did not vote for the candidate of her husband’s choosing in the Lok Sabha election, he pronounced triple divorce and threw her out. There are several cases of talaq that are as absurd as this one, if not more so. Many others go unreported. Then there is this curious case from Kerala: members of orthodox Sunni groups are threatening to agitate if women are allowed to pray on Friday in the mosque.
What do such developments convey to the world? Do women have secondary status in Islam? Is it a sin to pray in a mosque on Friday? What sort of Islam is this? For many Muslims, orthodox customs have become more important than Qur’anic injunctions. They do not know that Islam was the first religion in the world to empower women and give them equal legal status. Commenting on verse 2:228, Maulana Azad in his Tarjuman al-Qur’an, says that it is a revolutionary declaration of equality of the sexes made 1,300 years ago. But Muslim society, under the influence of a feudal ethos, never realised this revolutionary potential.
But time is running out on such regressive attitudes. Even in conservative Saudi society, there are stirrings of change. Last week, 70 Saudi Arabian scholars and intellectuals participated in a national dialogue in Madina to address the issue of women’s rights. Several women scholars read out papers at the conclave, aimed at creating an environment conducive for Saudi intellectuals to discuss the position of women in Saudi society.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In India, too, Muslim women have become more conscious of their Islamic rights and are demanding changes in personal law in keeping with Qur’anic teachings. Take the issue of talaq, which is regarded as a highly sensitive issue. The Holy Qur’an is very cautious in matters of divorce. Yet, despite clear Qur’anic injunctions to the contrary, we approve of triple divorce in one sitting and destroy marital life in one breath. How can such an act be Islamic? It is the source of the greatest injustice, especially for women.
There are four key words in the Qur’an: adl, ihsan, rahmah and hikmah (justice, benevolence, compassion and wisdom). Triple talaq is against all these principles. It is not just, nor benevolent, nor compassionate, nor an act of wisdom. In fact, the Qur’an does not permit triple divorce at all. Among other injunctions, the three talaqs have to be spaced out over a period of three months so that the couple gets enough time for reconciliation through the intervention of relatives and friends.
Some Muslim women have devised a standard nikahnama (marriage contract) strictly within the Shari’ah framework and handed it to the Muslim Personal Law Board (MPLB) a couple of years ago. Since marriage in Islam is a contract, such a nikahnama is perfectly valid and was approved by a great scholar like Maulana Ashraf Thanavi. But the MPLB is hesitant to implement even this very modest reform that could give great relief to Muslim women.
All ’ulama agree that pronouncing triple talaq in one sitting is bid’ah (an innovation) and that bid’ah is a sin. Yet this sinful practice is enforced in the name of divine law. It’s time, then, to make every possible attempt to eradicate this sinful practice. The ’ulama, who are the guardians of Islamic law, should play a leading role in this process. I have talked with many of them, who privately agree that this form of divorce should be abolished but do not have courage to say so publicly.
Many men are Islamically illiterate and do not even realise that triple divorce is a sinful form of divorce. If the members of the MPLB do not have courage to abolish this form of divorce, they should at least have courage to launch an awareness movement on the issue and educate Muslim men on the need to desist from adopting this sinful form of divorce. As early as 1939, Maulana Ashraf Thanvi and others, took the bold step to draft the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, which gave great relief to the Muslim women of the day. Can the MPLB not show such wisdom and draft a comprehensive law codifying Muslim personal law on the lines of the 1939 Act? And even as the MPLB takes up this concern, can’t progressive and practicing Muslims also come forward and support this movement for reform?
If Maulana Ashraf Thanvi could take such a bold step over 60 years ago, why can’t our ’ulama in the 21st century do likewise? This will be not only in keeping with the true spirit of Islam but will also go a long way in improving the image of Islam in India. It is because of such un-Qur’anic practices that the image of Islam has suffered and the demand for a Uniform Civil Code periodically raised."

Amid a raging debate on triple talaq, senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar on Saturday described the practice as “evil” and used it as a metaphor to appeal to the youth of Kashmir to divorce the gun and shun violence. “Talaq is evil… and teachings of prophet also say no to it. So, if you want to say talaq, tell it to guns,” he told a gathering of Kashmiri students at a conference here organised by Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an RSS affiliate.

Why use it against the one who feeds you? Instead use it against the gun,” he added. Kumar, who has worked on Kashmir for years, exhorted the youth of the Valley not to take to the gun but walk the path of peace.
“Guns don’t give lives but take lives, it doesn’t educate you but snatches your education, it doesn’t give you comfort but fear,” he said.
Violent protests for months last year had hit hard the normal life and resulted in shutdown of schools and death of 86 people, in the wake of killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani."

The historic mandate in Uttar Pradesh is a watershed moment in India’s electoral history. The poisonous cocktail of caste and communal politics was swept away by the Modi tsunami, with the BJP’s landslide victory stunning political pundits and media commentators alike. Coming within months of the revolutionary decision to ban high-value currency notes, which many sceptics prophesied would lead to an electoral debacle for the BJP, the stupendous victory showed that the people are with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his war against black money and corruption. Demonetisation received a huge thumbs-up, even though it was disruptive in the sense that it caused some temporary inconvenience.
The verdict from Uttarakhand, and more particularly Uttar Pradesh, is a clear negation of the vote bank politics of the BJP’s opponents, and a complete endorsement of the development agenda of the NDA government. By shunting out non-performing governments, the voters sent out a clear message — perform or perish. The BJP’s performance is all the more remarkable in the backdrop of the pronounced caste-ridden politics in Uttar Pradesh, the state’s backwardness and in terms of the sheer number of its constituencies. Because of its geographical and demographic spread, the UP elections were a major test for demonetisation.
The verdict showed that the charisma of Modi, the meticulous political planning and social engineering by BJP president Amit Shah and the slew of pro-poor, pro-farmer and pro-women schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana have endeared the BJP to the electorate. People want good governance and development and believe that Modi alone can deliver, especially in the wake of a scam-free, corruption-free administration since the NDA assumed office in 2014.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The mindless opposition to demonetisation by various political parties, the attempts to openly appease minorities by depicting the BJP as a bogeyman, the lack of development, rampant corruption, absence of law and order, discrimination against a section of the people by the administration, the sidelining of SP patriarch, Mulayam Singh, the distasteful personal attacks on the prime minister, the inexperience of leaders of the SP-Congress alliance in contrast to the credibility and experience of PM Modi, are among the major factors that contributed to the BJP’s landslide win in UP.
The attempts by the BJP’s political rivals to create social tensions on university campuses, provoke some groups to launch agitations for reservations or strike fear in the minds of traders in the wake of demonetisation have all boomeranged. This is borne out by the fact that the youth, Jats and the business community clearly voted for the BJP.
The election verdict was a severe indictment of the opportunistic alliance of the SP and Congress, and a total rejection of the unscrupulous tactics of the BSP. The SP was handed one of its worst humiliations and was reduced from 224 seats in 2012 to 44 seats this time. The BSP and Congress are on the verge of extinction with the former securing 19 seats and the latter not able to touch double digits with only seven seats.
After having castigated the SP’s misrule and announcing Sheila Dikshit as its chief ministerial candidate, the Congress party’s unprincipled embrace of the SP and the claim that “UP ko yeh saath pasand hai” (UP favours this alliance) to checkmate the BJP proved to be a disaster for both parties. People also sent out the message that they want governments that deliver, not governments that work for family dynasties. The opportunistic stand adopted by the Congress, SP and BSP on major issues like triple talaq, surgical strikes and the open support by some of these parties to separatists and ultra-left Maoists seeking the disintegration of India have also contributed to the BJP’s victory. The perception that the SP was indulging in obstructionist politics by not fully cooperating with the NDA government at the Centre was also a factor that led people to support the BJP.
With the negative tactics adopted by the Congress, SP and BSP in blocking progressive legislation, like the GST Bill in Parliament, also not going down well with the people, the verdict will now pave the way for ensuring a smooth passage of PM Modi’s development agenda in the Rajya Sabha in the future. The BJP’s political rivals, rather than gracefully accepting the historic verdict, are stooping to a new low by making baseless allegations that the EVMs were tampered with. The Election Commission, of course, has rebutted these charges. The defeat of the SAD-BJP in Punjab due to anti-incumbency showed how meritless the charge is.
Another remarkable achievement of the BJP in this round of elections was the expansion of its footprint in the Northeast. After making huge inroads in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, the vote share of the BJP has increased from 2.12 per cent to 36 per cent in Manipur. In Goa, though the BJP secured less seats than the Congress, the party secured 31.6 per cent votes as against 26 per cent for the Congress. It should be noted that the BJP’s former partner, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, polled 11.6 per cent votes. The vote share went up from 15 per cent to 39.7 per cent in UP and from 33 per cent to 46.5 per cent in Uttarakhand. In all, the BJP secured a higher percentage of votes than its opponents in four states, while the vote share was reduced in Punjab due to anti-incumbency.
The results of these “semi-final” polls show that people want to go with Modi for faster development and corruption-free governance. It is evident that there is a new hunger among the people for development. The BJP has emerged as a common man’s pan-India party, with a nationalist outlook. My final conclusions are that development has emerged as the new religion and real social identity of the people. With this new religion, Prime Minister Modi has unified the country. Dynasty-based politics will soon become passé. The reforms process will receive a huge fillip and the obstructionist tactics of our opponents in the Rajya Sabha will lose steam. The NDA will definitely have a smoother process for the presidential elections. The ultimate message here is that people clearly want Modi for one more term."

When BJP president Amit Shah meets PM Narendra Modi, he is sometimes asked a question he struggles to answer: “What is behenji thinking?” By “behenji”, or “older sister”, Modi means Mayawati, the enigmatic politician and former Uttar Pradesh CM. Modi’s keen interest in what the 60-year-old is up to reflects concern about his political prospects, amid an economic recovery that many poor Indians have yet to feel and rising social tensions among sizeable minority communities.

With a near-devotional following from tens of millions of people who, like her, belong to the bottom rung of India’s social hierarchy, Mayawati is emerging as Modi’s chief challenger in a key state election set for early next year. “Mayawati is the biggest threat to our victory,” Sanjeev Balyan, a federal minister in Modi’s government, told Reuters. “The one who becomes the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh gets to be the most powerful political leader after the prime minister.” Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, in the 2014 general election, handing him the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades.
Also read |  Dalits are right: Enough is enoughhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A repeat of that success would help Modi, who remains popular among most Indians, wrest control of the federal parliament’s upper house, making it easier than it has been to pass key reforms. It would also significantly advance his chances of retaining power when India chooses its next prime minister in 2019. But violent attacks on Dalits, as those on the lowest social rung are known, are turning the opinion of some against the BJP and its Hindu nationalist supporters, giving Mayawati a new lease of life as she seeks a political renaissance.
WHERE ARE DALIT JOBS?
Mayawati is calling on minority groups to reject the BJP, whose roots are in Hindu nationalism that many Dalits and Muslims see as a threat to their way of life. “Communal forces are becoming stronger,” she told 300,000 cheering supporters, as she kicked off her election campaign at a sprawling park she built to honour lower caste Indians, previously known as “untouchables”, in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow. “I want to ask the prime minister … where are the jobs for Dalit boys and girls?” she said. “He will never understand the problems faced by us.” Speaking on the sidelines of the rally, Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) general secretary Satish Mishra said Dalits and Muslims “were totally unsafe” under Modi, a view that reflects Mayawati’s strategy to try and convince the two groups to vote as one.

Some lower caste voters deserted her BSP in 2014, allowing the BJP to win 71 out of 80 seats. But a series of attacks on Dalits this year has re-energised Mayawati. Self-styled hardline Hindu cow protectors have targeted Dalits and Muslims who make money skinning dead cows, accusing them of killing animals sacred to Hindus. In July, footage emerged of four lower caste men tied to a car, stripped and being flogged in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, triggering violent protests. Dressed in her trademark beige salwar kameez, Mayawati has sped across the country to appear at the side of victims. “Mayawati has herself a godsend,” said Ramesh Dixit, a former professor of political science at Lucknow University, referring to the attacks.
“FIRST-RATE EGOMANIAC”
Born into a family of leather workers and raised in a Delhi slum, Mayawati, unmarried and her private life fiercely guarded, lives in a windowless room in a palatial house with 20-foot boundary walls and a towering statue of herself in the garden. A “Dalit Queen” to the millions destined to a life sweeping streets or rag-picking under the Hindu caste system that defines people by job, critics have accused her of lavishing money on luxury homes and diamond necklaces while ignoring the poor.

During her 2007-2012 term as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, she spent millions of dollars on vast memorial parks with life-sized marble and sandstone statues of elephants, her party symbol, of Dalit icons and of herself – echoing the region’s 19th century Muslim rulers who built monuments to preserve their legacies. A U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2011 described her as a “first-rate egomaniac” and she remains unapologetic about her personal extravagance, although officials in her party say she has since reduced the level of public pomp. Mayawati declined requests for an interview.
BJP CHIEF’S 150 VISITS
Shah, one of Modi’s most trusted confidants and his chief election strategist, is betting he can expand the BJP’s appeal from its traditional base of prosperous and upper caste voters to less privileged Indians. In the past 24 months, Shah has visited Uttar Pradesh more than 150 times. Mayawati lost power in 2012 to the incumbent socialist regional party that is also expected to put up a tough fight in state elections provisionally scheduled for February.
But it is Mayawati whom Modi and Shah fear most, three sources close to the men told Reuters. Dalits account for 22 percent of Uttar Pradesh’s population, and Muslims, many of whom also feel disenfranchised by Modi, the BJP and their conservative Hindu backers, another 19 percent. Modi has condemned the recent attacks, but an influential hardline Hindu organisation reminded him that open criticism of cow vigilantes would send the wrong signal to his natural support base. The effort to win over Dalits gets to the heart of the dilemma facing Modi: he must placate wealthier and middle class Hindu voters while appealing to the broader electorate with a vision of a better future.
SHARING A MEAL
Caste remains a defining feature for people across poor and agrarian Uttar Pradesh, where India’s two-decade economic boom has barely been felt. No single community is numerous enough to win an election, forcing parties to widen their appeal. Starting with Shah sitting down to share a meal with a Dalit family in May, the BJP has tried to project itself as siding with the poor, even as attacks on marginalised communities capture the headlines. Shah has poached several high-profile leaders from Mayawati and plans to reserve up to half of Uttar Pradesh’s state assembly seats for Dalits, one source close to Shah said.

Modi has praised the work of Dalit hero B.R. Ambedkar, and the BJP also wants to mould new icons from that community. At this month’s annual meeting of Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the BJP which holds considerable sway over the party, the chief guest was a member of the dirt-poor Dalit street sweeping community.
RISING ASPIRATIONS
Not everyone from the lower castes is sure of who will best serve them. Fifty kilometres east of Lucknow, in Bedaru, villager Rampyari, illiterate and unsure of her age, is seeing the seeds of change that the BJP hopes will win votes. Upper caste Indians have begun to permit her family to attend the same temple, although not at the same time, while a gas canister will shortly replace her wooden stove under a scheme launched by Modi.
Still, her support of Mayawati is unwavering, and upon hearing the name, Rampyari said: “She has to come back. Dalits feel empowered when she is in power.” But in a central Lucknow slum, Shobha Valmiki makes $25 a month collecting waste, and feels let down by her. “Nothing has changed,” she said, as goats and donkeys wandered down her rubbish-strewn lane. “They address me as scavenger, not by my own name.”"

Talking about the rights of Muslim women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that the issue of Triple Talaq should not be politicised. “Female foeticide is a sin. So what if the sinner is a Hindu. My government has taken a number of steps (to stop this practice). Daughters, mothers, sisters should be protected. One should not consider religion. Mothers and sisters should be respected. We have raised the issue firmly.

“Now the issue of talaq has come up. Just like if any Hindu commits female foeticide he will have to go to jail, similarly what is the crime of my Muslim sisters that some one says talaq over phone and her life is destroyed,” he said addressing a “Maha Parivartan Rally” here in the Bundelkhand region in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Urging TV news channels to not turn triple talaq into an issue of Hindu versus Muslim or BJP versus other parties, Modi said that in its submission to the Supreme Court, the central government had clearly stated that there should not be any atrocity on women and there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion.
“In democracy, there should be discussion. The government has put forward its position. Those who want to digress from triple talaq are instigating people…in the country, lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be ruined by triple talaq,” he said.
In his speech, the Prime Minister asked the audience whether the rights of Muslim women should be protected or not and whether they should get equal rights or not?
“I am surprised that some political parties of the country in their lust for vote bank are hell-bent upon committing injustice to women in the 21st century. What kind of justice is this?
“Politics and elections have their own place but getting Muslim women their rights as per the Constitution is the responsibility of the government and the people of the country,” he said.

Asking the media to not turn the issue of triple talaq as a matter between the government and the opposition, Modi said, “The debate should be between knowledgeable persons from Muslim community knowing ‘Quran’. In Muslim community, knowledgeable and progressive people are there. There are educated Muslim women who can put their views forth.”
“When you do TV debate do not turn it into Hindu-Muslim issues. Debate should be between those who want change in Muslim society and those who do not want 125 crore Indians to know what is the issue,” the Prime Minister said.
He said in a democracy, there should be discussion. The government has put its position but there are people who want to digress from triple talaq and are instigating the people, he said.
The prime minister also expressed hope of BJP’s victory in the assembly elections in UP next year. “In the coming polls, the picture is very clear. Just like it was in Lok Sabha polls of 2014. People gave full majority to BJP,” said Modi.
He urged the nation to break the cycle of the two parties to make Uttar Pradesh an “Uttam Pradesh”.

“The Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party both loot in their own turns, and when the other comes to power they never take action against the other. SP-BSP-BSP-SP. The power keeps shifting, and in this game, this land never reached its potential. You have faced enough. If you want to escape this trap then you need to get out of this trap of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. Let’s break the cycle of SP-BSP and choose instead to make Uttar Pradesh an “Uttam Pradesh”,” Modi said."

We need a place to not just offer prayers, but share our feelings and rest,’’ declares 40-year-old Balkees Beevi at a jamaat in Pudukottai.
Her ‘‘blasphemous’’ statement is not greeted with angry shouts, instead there is applause. The reason: it’s the country’s first all-women gathering of its kind, the Tamizhaga Muslim Women’s Jamaat. For distressed Muslim women, tortured by in-laws or abandoned by NRI husbands, the all-women jamaat organised by STEPS, an NGO, has become a ‘‘platform for protest and relief’’.
Their next step: an all-women mosque, a demand that has been criticised by  orthodox sections. But that has not deterred women like Balkees, who approached the jamaat last year after her son-in-law was found to have undergone a ‘‘family planning operation’’ before his marriage.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the village jamaat ‘‘supported the boy’s family’’, she approached the women’s jamaat. ‘‘Now, my daughter is separated from him,’’ says Balkees.
There’s 29-year-old Rasheeda Begum who divorced her husband, who abandoned her and left for Malaysia, after giving her a son. ‘‘He returned two years later, but started torturing me. I decided it was not worth living with him anymore,’’ she says.
When she walked out, her in-laws approached the local jamaat and sought custody of the child. But Rasheeda, an M.Phil in Tamil Literature, declared ‘‘triple talaq’’ through the all-women jamaat. Now, she is a part-time college lecturer and is among the 25-member jamaat, supervising a home for children of ‘‘victims of triple talaq’’.
For STEPS founder Sharifa Khanam, the ‘‘shocking’’ findings of a survey in 1995 prompted her to create the all-women jamaat a couple of years ago.
The NGO’s survey found that every fifth woman in Pudukottai, with a Muslim population of five lakh, had been dumped through triple talaq. The more  alarming fact was that teenaged girls were being married off as second or third wives to elderly men.
The all-male jamaats, which assemble in mosques, would ‘‘sanction’’ triple talaq without hearing the women, who are not allowed inside. ‘‘They do not get back the huge dowry money’’ leave alone maintenance, says Khanam.
While Shariat insists that men have to pay mehar to the bride, most Muslim families in TN offer just about Rs 500 and demand a huge dowry, she adds. ‘‘We write to the boy’s family to return the dowry. If they do not, we approach the local jamaat. If there is no response still, we go to the all-women police station for intervention,’’ she says.
However, Khanam and her brigade still face resistance from clerics and jamaats. ‘‘I receive threatening calls asking me to stop this jamaat. But I tell them, if you adjudicate as per Shariat I will wind up my jamaat.’’
A possible solution, Khanam says, is a mosque run by women for women. But then, that’s not as easy as it sounds. Sherfuddin, a local cleric, did offer land at Parambur village, 20 km away. But he withdrew the offer within a month. Reason: pressure from ulemas in Delhi.
Argues Hyder Ali, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam: ‘‘Why do women need a separate mosque? Islam permits women to offer prayers at mosque and several mosques do often permit women. Some mosques don’t allow women, but that is a local problem.’’ Khanam counters: ‘‘Our concept is not just a house of prayer, it will create new social space for them within the community.’’"

Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi discussed the issue during an hour-long meeting.

Sources said no final decision has been taken by the Group of Ministers (GoM) and it will deliberate the issue further before finalising the government’s stand to be taken in the apex court.
The development came after a Muslim woman, who was divorced by her husband through a phone call from Dubai, challenged the Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and nikah halala, leading the Supreme Court to seek response from the Centre on her plea.
Talaq-e–bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing more than one talaq in a single ‘tuhr’ (the period between two menstruations), or in a tuhr after coitus, or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple talaq).
Nikah halala refers to the marriage of a woman with another man who subsequently divorces her so that her previous husband can remarry her.
While dealing with the plea of the 26-year-old woman from Kolkata whose husband divorced her by saying talaq thrice over telephone from Dubai, a bench comprising Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, had issued notice to the Ministry of Minority Affairs and others.
Petitioner Ishrat Jahan has sought a declaration from the court that Section 2 of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution “in so far as it seeks to recognise and validate talaq-e-bidat (triple talaq) as a valid form of divorce”.
“My husband and his relatives are constantly attempting to drive me out of my matrimonial home,” Jahan had said, adding that her four children were also forcibly taken away from her.
“The petitioner does not have any support as her parents are residing in Bihar. She is surviving with her sister’s help. The police are also not making any effort to trace her children,” the petition said while seeking urgent directions from the court for her and her children’s protection."

A DAY after West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said Centre had no right to decide on how a person will live with his wife, BJP moved the state Commission for Women accusing him of speaking “against the rights of women” and “demeaning the process of empowerment of women.” BJP also slammed the ruling Trinamool Congress for siding with Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in opposing abolition of triple talaq in the country, saying it was playing vote bank politics without considering the plight of 1.5 crore Muslim women in West Bengal.

“We strongly condemn comments made by the state Education Minister Partha Chatterjee during the event hosted by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind leader and TMC cabinet minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury,”said actor-politician and state BJP secretary Locket Chatterjee. Criticising Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for sending two of her senior ministers — Partha and Firhad Hakim — to the rally, Locket said BJP has sent a complaint to the state Women’s Commission against contents of their speech there.
Jamiat was joined by TMC on November 5 in a protest rally against the BJP-led NDA government’s stand on triple talaq issue in connection with a case in the Supreme Court. Addressing the rally, Partha had targeted Prime Minister Marendra Modi. “Who are you to decide how I will live with my wife. You will not be able to grow a lotus here. You will not be able to gain grounds in Bengal. I assure Siddiqullah that we will stand by him in the fight.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In its complaint, the BJP said: “They spoke openly against the rights of women and demeaned the process of empowerment of women”. Locket said the complaint was related to “their (the three ministers) alleged inflammatory advocacy of deprivation of women’s rights and publicly renouncing the proceedings of the Supreme Court in the matter of rights of women issue.”
A copy of the complaint has also been forwarded to the chairperson of National Commission for Women, she said. Locket also accused Mamata of playing votebank politics. “Chief Minister and her ministers are supporting triple talaq for vote bank politics and are using the sentiments of the minority community only for narrow political gains.
The CM, despite being a woman, is trying to push 1.5 crore Muslim women in the state into darkness and a life of uncertainty when BJP is trying to ensure equal rights for them,” she claimed. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “It is intriguing that a woman CM has taken a stand in favour of triple talaq against all Muslim women and their rights. Mamata Banerjee alleges that BJP is a communal party, but this goes on to show that it is the chief minister herself who is doing communal politics.” While the state Commission for Women chief Sunanda Mukherjee could not be contacted, Lalitha Kumarmangalam, chairperson, NCW, said that they have not received any such letter."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked for the issue of triple talaq not to be politicised for the sake of votes, telling a rally in Bundelkhand: “Is it fair for a man to say talaq thrice over the phone and a Muslim woman’s life to be ruined?”
Instantaneous talaq — or talaq-e-bidat — now faces a challenge before the Supreme Court. It is important to understand, however, that this is different from the practice of talaq uttered thrice by the man, over a period of three months.

Unlike Hinduism and Christianity where marriage has been traditionally viewed as a sacrament, under Muslim law, marriage is a civil contract based on consent as spelt out in the utterance of qabul. The ideal form of dissolution of this contract, based on the Prophet’s tradition, is considered to be talaq-ul-sunnat pronounced in ahsan form. Under this form, once the husband pronounces talaq, there has to be a three-month iddat period to factor in three menstrual cycles of the woman. This time is meant for reconciliation and arbitration. During this period, if any kind cohabitation occurs, the talaq is considered to have been revoked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, over the years talaq-e-bidat, a practice acknowledged to be bad in theology even by the clergy, has been upheld by the same clergy as valid and good in law.
Talaq-e-bidat has allowed men to pronounce talaq thrice in one sitting, sometimes scrawled in a written talaqnama, or even by phone or text message. Thereafter, even if the man himself perceives his decision to have been hasty in hindsight, the divorce remains irrevocable. The only way he can then go back to living with his wife is through a nikah halala. This requires her to go through the entire process all over again — remarry, consummate the second marriage, get divorced, observe the iddat period and then come back to him.
The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, has codified a Muslim woman’s right to seek divorce (khula) which she can do by approaching the courts. However, when it comes to all other personal law matters including talaq, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, states that the Shariat will govern Indian Muslims without specifying what exactly it is. Merely doing away with talaq-e-bidat may not entirely ensure absolute gender parity in matters of divorce since, unlike the woman, the man will still reserve the right to talaq without having to take the legal route.
For now, the overwhelming demand of women from the community is for doing away with talaq-e-bidat. “It’s one step at a time; we cannot expect a drastic momentum. Talaq-e-bidat is the most barbaric of practices. Once it is outlawed, gradually reform in all aspects of Muslim personal law can happen. This is the reason why we have been demanding a comprehensive, codified Muslim personal law,” said Zakia Soman, co-founder of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a mass organisation of Muslim women in India."

SAMAJWADI PARTY national president Mulayam Singh Yadav will hold his first public meeting for the 2017 UP elections on Wednesday from Muslim-OBC dominated Ghazipur district, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed BJP’s Parivartan Yatra on November 14.
The rally is being organised by jailed mafia don Mukhtar Ansari’s party, Quami Ekta Dal (QED), which had merged with the SP last month. It would be held on the RTI ground where Modi had also addressed his rally.
Watch what else is making news:

SP state president Shivpal Yadav, who had played a key role behind the merger, reached Ghazipur on Tuesday. Speaking to mediapersons, he said: “Tomorrow’s rally will be historic.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
With QED leaders, including Mukhtar’s brothers Afzal Ansari (former SP MP) and Sibgatullah Ansari (Ghazipur MLA), being key organisers of the rally, SP is expecting a huge gathering of Muslims.
The Ghazipur rally will be the first such public meeting of Mulayam.
He plans to hold 18 rallies — one in each division —- before the elections early next year. Ghazipur falls in Varanasi division and is adjacent to Mulayam’s Lok Sabha constituency of Azamgarh. Mulayam had earlier planned to hold his first rally in Azamgarh on October 6, but it was cancelled.
Local SP leaders said while they expect Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to attend the rally, they did not know whether Mulayam’s cousin Ram Gopal Yadav would also be present.
Till late Monday, the district administration and police denied having any information about Akhilesh’s presence in the rally.
“Several senior SP leaders and ministers will be present because it will be the first public meeting of the party chief before the elections. We have a target to gather 2.5 lakh people at least… we will give a befitting reply to the PM’s rally,” said SP’s Ghazipur district president Rajesh Kushwaha.
Afzal Ansari, who was the QED president before the merger, said that the rally will outshine Modi’s

public meeting.
“If I get the opportunity to speak, I will raise the issue of triple talaq and matters related to the Muslim Shariat… Netaji (Mulayam) will not let RSS agenda and Gujarat model applied to UP. RSS and BJP are trying to attack the laws of Shariat and kill innocent people in the name of beef,” he added.
Asked whether Akhilesh and Ram Gopal would attend the rally, Ansari said: “It is Mulayam’s public meeting and it is not necessary that all leaders campaign at one place.”
In Ghazipur district, Muslims are found in a sizeable numbers in four Assembly segments — Ghazipur Sadar, Zamania, Zahoorabad and Jangipur. Supporters from Azamgarh, Mau, Ballia, Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Jaunpur districts too are expected to attend the rally."

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for raising “religious” slogans, as he alleged that the BJP-led government’s real intention was to “convert India into a Hindu rashtra”.
“He (Modi) is the first Prime Minister since independence to use ‘religious’ slogans during a public rally…India had seen so many PMs and will see many more, but no Prime Minister has ever raised a religious slogan,” the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP said while referring to Modi’s ‘Jai Shri Ram’ greeting on Dussehra in Lucknow.

“All Indians think for a while, if anyone wearing a skull cap and sporting beard becomes PM and says ‘Allah-o-Akbar’, all channels will run (news) that India has become an Islamic country. (But) If Modi raises ‘majahabi’ (religious) slogan, no one will say anything,” he said.
Continuing his tirade, Owaisi said, “Aapka asal maksad ye hain ki Hindustan to Hindu Rashtra me tabdil kiya jaye. (Your real intention is to convert India into Hindu nation).”
The leader was speaking at a protest meeting organised by All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) at AIMIM party headquarters at Darussalam here, opposing the NDA government’s stand on Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and triple talaq.
Owaisi termed as a “joke” the affidavit filed by Union government on October 7 in the Supreme Court opposing the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favouring a relook on grounds of gender equality and secularism.
“If you really believe in secularism…why did you Mr Modi impose beef ban in Maharashtra and why does your government want to construct a museum in the name of Ram in Ayodhya? Then why do you (government) say state has no religion and the country has no religion?,” he asked.
“India is a secular democracy and the state has no religion. (But) your government is insulting Muslims of the country…your government has insulted the country by comparing Muslims of India with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka Turkey, Indonesia (in the affidavit),” the AIMIM chief said.
Taking a dig at RSS, he said, “After ninety years of wearing shorts, the kid has now grown up and wearing trousers. After ninety years, you realised now we will wear pants (trouser). Ok..you wore pants but you should have asked what the belt is made of? Is it buffalo’s (meat)?”
“I would like to tell the Prime Minister of India…If you really want to help Muslim women, please help Zakia Jafri whose husband (former Congress lawmaker) Ehsan Jafri was killed in front of her eyes, cut into pieces and set on fire. She is waiting for justice,” Owaisi added."

Part IV of the Constitution of India deals with the Directive Principles of State Policy, which aren’t enforceable by any court, but which are supposed to play a fundamental role in the governance of the country, with the government duty-bound to apply these principles in making laws.
Among other Directive Principles is Article 44, which asks the State to “endeavour to secure for citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India”.The Uniform Civil Code is currently at the centre of heated public debate, with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board accusing the government of attempting to sneak it in under the garb of promoting gender equality through its opposition to triple talaq in the Supreme Court.

In fact, Article 44 has always been contentious — as Article 35 of the draft Constitution, it was one of the most debated clauses in the Constituent Assembly as it set about the task of drafting a new Constitution for the recently-independent sovereign nation of India. The Constituent Assembly saw a division along communal lines among members, and the clause was adopted only after B R Ambedkar, Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, assured the minorities that the Article would not be thrust upon them.
On November 23, 1948, when the Article was being discussed, Mohamad Ismail, a Member of the Constituent Assembly from Madras, proposed that a proviso be added to Article 35, which, if adopted, would have allowed “any group, section or community of people” to decide against giving up its own personal laws in case it had such a law.
Ismail asserted that the right of a group or community to follow its own personal law was among the fundamental rights, since any tinkering with it would be “tantamount to interference with the way of life of those people who have been observing these laws for generations and ages”.He was followed by Naziruddin Ahmad of West Bengal, who argued that it was not just Muslims — “each religious community has certain religious laws, certain civil laws inseparably connected with religious beliefs and practices”.

When Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib Bahadur of Madras asserted that as far as the Muslims were concerned, “their laws of succession, inheritance, marriage and divorce are completely dependent upon their religion”, M Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, who went on to become the second Speaker of Lok Sabha, said marriages among Muslims are a “matter of contract”.
To this, Baig responded that this contract “is enjoined on the Mussalmans by the Quran and if it is not followed, a marriage is not a legal marriage at all”.Backing the motion moved by Mohamad Ismail, B Pocker Sahib Bahadur (Madras) referred to the questions being raised by some Hindu Members to the proposed Article.
Backing the motion moved by Mohamad Ismail, B Pocker Sahib Bahadur (Madras) referred to the questions being raised by some Hindu Members to the proposed Article.
“I know there are great differences in the law of inheritance and various other matters between the various sections of the Hindu community. Is this Assembly going to set aside all these differences and make them uniform? By uniform, I ask, what do you mean and which particular law, of which community are you going to take as the standard?” he asked.“What have you got in your mind in enacting a clause like this? There are the Mitakshara and Dayabhaga systems; there are so many other systems followed by various other communities. What is it that you are making the basis?”

He received support from several other Hindu Members.

“Are we going to permit this piecemeal legislation on the ground that it affects the personal law of the country? It is, therefore, not merely a question for minorities but it also affects the majority. I know there are many among Hindus who do not like a uniform civil code because they take the same view as the honourable Muslim Members who spoke last. They feel that the personal law of inheritance, succession, etc. is really a part of their religion,” Munshi said.Ambedkar too opposed the amendments, pointing out that in North Malabar (Kerala), “the Marumakkathayam Law applied to all — not only to Hindus, but also to Muslims”. And, “it is to be remembered that the Marumakkathayam Law is a matriarchal form of law and not a patriarchal form of law.”

Babasaheb then went on to reassure Muslims, saying that “they have read rather too much into Article 35, which merely proposes that the State shall endeavour to secure a civil code for the citizens of the country.
“It does not say that after the Code is framed the State shall enforce it upon all citizens merely because they are citizens. It is perfectly possible that the future Parliament may make a provision by way of making a beginning that the Code shall apply only to those who make a declaration that they are prepared to be bound by it, so that in the initial stage the application of the Code may be purely voluntary. Parliament may feel the ground by some such method.“This”, Ambedkar said, “is not a novel method. It was adopted in the Shariat Act of 1937 when it was applied to territories other than the North-West Frontier Province. The law said that here is a Shariat law which should be applied to Mussulmans who wanted that he should be bound by the Shariat Act should go to an officer of the state, make a declaration that he is willing to be bound by it, and after he has made that declaration the law will bind him and his successors. It would be perfectly possible for Parliament to introduce a provision of that sort; so that the fear which my friends have expressed here will be altogether nullified.

“I, therefore, submit that there is no substance in these amendments and I oppose them,” Ambedkar said."

With the Narendra Modi government facing flak over its stand on triple talaq, BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday asked the partymen to make respect of women, besides development, an issue in the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Flagging off the third ‘Parivartan yatra’ from Sonebhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, Shah said “There is another question to which people of Uttar Pradesh will have to give their verdict (in the coming Assembly polls).
“Should women in the country not get equal rights? SP, BSP and Congress will not speak on (triple talaq) but we do not have any fear. I want to say from this platform that in the coming polls, besides development and eradication of goondas, respect of women should be made a poll issue,” Shah said.

He also asked the three parties to submit their affidavit on whether they back ‘triple talaq’ or not. Asking whether the Centre’s stand before the Supreme Court upholding the dignity and honour of the women and doing away with the triple talaq should have been taken or not, Shah said every single party worker will make women aware that Modi government is committed for their development, honour and rights.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Slamming Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Shah alleged that with his stand on the surgical strike, he has made a mockery of the bravery and sacrifice of army jawans.
“People of the country are proud of the army and the will power of Narendra Modi for carrying out surgical strikes in Pakistani soil and saving the borders,” he added."

Its internet department answers queries from Muslims across the world and sends out fatwas
Its a small room,cobwebs hanging from the ceiling,dysfunctional CPUs tucked away in the corner and stacks of programming books in Urdu and English. To think that here,in the internet department of the second largest Islamic seminary in the world,amid the gleam of computer screens and the workaday rhythm of a nondescript office is where the Darul Uloom Deoband madarsa declares what it thinks is every Muslims guide to the pious life. 
Four menMuhammadullah (30),Salahuddin (28),Abdul Hadi (32) and Hussain Ahmed (30)employees of the 140-year-old seminary maintain darulifta-deoband.org,an online question-and-answer platform on which anyone can ask questions,in English and Urdu,on a variety of issues from international relations and womens issues to clothing,lifestyle,food and marriage,among others. The answers to them are known as fatwas,which,contrary to popular belief,are not diktats but only opinions based on Islamic jurisprudence. 
We get some 600 questions each month by e-mail,40 per cent of which are in English, Muhammadullah says. Earlier,the website would allow users to send questions 24×7,now it accepts questions only four days a week. Otherwise,the waiting time for an answer would be two months, he says. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The four men are intermediaries between the audience and the darul-ifta,an eight-member mufti council that issues the fatwas. They copy-paste each English question on to a document in Inpage (a software),type its translation in Urdu,print it and send it to the darul-ifta. The council takes a week to give an answer,which they translate into English and upload on the website. 
Some questions deal with serious issues such as triple talaq but most are bizarre. Sample these: Is it a sin to wear trousers and shirts?,Can a necktie be worn while offering namaz?,Can Muslims celebrate birthdays? The answers,if you were wondering,are a no,in each case.
Muhammadullah disagrees that the questions are too trivial. If a Muslim wants to lead a lifestyle in a pure way,whats wrong with that? We have an answer to every question, he says. 
Irony is not a strongly developed sense in Darul Uloom. Ties and trousers are written off as ways of the debauched Westerners but the computer is a born Muslim; photography is unlawful but video-chatting is perfectly fine,and while fatwas are doled out against unveiled Muslim working women who interact with men,clerics interact with this correspondent,an unveiled Muslim working woman,with ease.
The internet team also maintains and writes the content of darululoom-deoband.com,which is in English,Hindi,Urdu and Arabic. It was designed by Jitender Kumar,owner of a local cyber café,and has pieces about the seminarys history,its founders bios,a photo-gallery (no human images,only the seminarys building) and Islamic articles in Urdu. The team writes the articles and uploads them. None of us are into programming. We write content,maintain websites and fix hardware, says Salahuddin. So,are they maintenance engineers-cum-content writers? We keep away from fancy designations, he says.
They keep away from being photographed too. They had uploaded a fatwa some time back which called for burning all photographs. But we notice a webcam on Muhammadullahs desk. Yes,I chat with my friends on Yahoo!,MSN and GTalk, he says. But doesnt that involve human images? They are moving,live images,which are temporary. Its like looking at yourself in the mirror. Human photographs can be stored,thats why they are prohibited, he says.
Muhammadullah also has an account on Facebook (he has no female friends) and runs a blog. Are any of the websites blocked,like Youtube or Orkut? No,not a single website is blocked,not even the pornographic ones, says the head of the internet and computer department,Maulana Abdussalam Qasmi. We only discourage our staff and students to surf immoral content. They have been mentally conditioned not to go near such websites. When we have blocked their minds against them,why block websites? he says. 
The seminarys leading authority,deputy vice-chancellor Maulana Abdul Khalique Madrasi,discourages his students from unnecessary surfing. I know how to use the computer and e-mail. But I dont like the advertisements that pop up and have images. Ive even stopped watching cricket after it has introduced cheerleaders in its tradition, he says. Students may be careful in the use of the computer but they have no option when it comes to watching cricket. Television is prohibited on the campus. 
But the computer is a born Muslim unlike television or other Western things,such as trousers,ties and birthday partiesdenounced as the ways of the debauched Jews and Christians. The computer doesnt understand a third thing,besides 0 and 1. A true Muslim believes that there is no god (0) but Allah (1). That way,computer ek paidaishi mussalman hai, says Qasmi,with a laugh. Theres nothing wrong in adopting Western inventions which can be put to good use,he says. 
Qasmi learned how to use the computer at an American company in Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,where he worked for 20 years before joining Darul Uloom in 1996. When computers were installed at his company in 1980,he learned how to use them and later began teaching trainees on AutoCad,Word and Excel. In 1990,he,along with an Indian and a Pakistani,created an Urdu pagemaking software called Sadaf and exported it to US,Canada,UK and Iran. When the business wound up,Qasmi saw Darul Ulooms vacancy for computer teachers in an Urdu newspaper. I felt I was the best person fit for the job. I was educated in Darul Uloom,had knowledge of computers,and wore a kurta,pajama and beard, says Qasmi. He says he left his job of Rs 80,000 a month for his current position as the only computer teacher at the seminary,which offered him Rs 4,000 monthly pay in 1996,and since then,has increased it by five per cent every year. 
Theres a lot of demand for computer courses among madarsa students,he says. In 1996,there were only three computers. We needed 10 students for our one-year diploma and got 250 applications, he says. Today,there are about 30 students,and 12 computers, he says. 
Inside the lab,boys,in their late teens and early twenties,are busy Photoshopping covers of Urdu books or making newspaper pages on Inpage,as part of their one-year diploma. Where would they go from here? Well teach computers at a madarsa or if our parents can afford to,well study computers further, says Mohammed Qasim. Would he work in a company,if it offers him a better salary than a madarsa? Only if they let me wear what I am wearing, he says. In any case,its the madarsas where we want to teach,a lot of them are setting up computer classes and theyd need teachers. Teaching in a madarsa will benefit Muslims.
The four internet workers,who earn Rs 7,000 a month,agree. The computer for us is just a tool to spread our message to Muslims, says Muhammadullah,who after passing out from Darul Uloom,enrolled in a two-year English course. Hadi worked as a maintenance engineer in Aligarh,Salahuddin did an MA in Islamic Studies and Ahmed worked as a TV journalist in Mumbai. All returned to help in its mission with the help of new technology."

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s party manifesto released for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections is heavily tinged with communal tones. While the documents speaks extensively about certain issues, it gives a miss to some issues which in the past have been vocally advocated or criticised by BJP leaders, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Firstly, there is a lot of focus on the alleged exodus of Hindu families from western Uttar Pradesh’s Kairana due to communal tension. The manifesto promises to set up a department led by the deputy collector in every district to ensure this doesn’t recur, especially in western UP. Secondly, a clear stand has been taken on the Ram Mandir issue, which is not entirely unexpected. While the issue used to be the party’s top agenda, it found only a half-hearted mention in BJP’s manifesto released for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
The issue of exodus has been raised as a superficial law and order issue, claiming that police stations in the state do not register complaints and FIRs in the state and such areas, which results in migration of families. Criticising the state’s law and order situation, the document holds it responsible for the alleged exodus.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, a strong message that all legal ways will be explored to resolve the Ram Mandir issue and to ensure its construction has been sent out. This comes out as a strong attempt to consolidate the Hindu vote but it also reflects the party’s equally shrewd move to keep hold of some of the Muslim vote bank. 
At the same time, the election manifesto is silent on justice for several thousand victims of Muzaffarnagar riots who have been moved from now-disbanded relief camps to settlement colonies. 
But choosing to tread a middle path, the party, in its manifesto, promises to take up the issue of triple talaq though the matter is in a legal logjam and no state-level solution is possible, either in the legislature or in the judiciary. 
The BJP has also not hesitated in using politics of freebies it so staunchly criticised as followed by AIADMK, SP, BSP and such parties. Free laptops and free internet, free insurance for government employees, free vikas bonds, 90 per cent reservation in all industries for youths, scholarship of ₹500 crore under the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, free assured electricity and LPG connections consist of all the freebies the party announced in its manifesto document."

THE Hyderabad Police on Thursday helped two daughters reunite with their mother, 28 years after they were separated. Nazia Sayeed, now 60, last saw her daughters Ayesha (33) and Fatima (32) before her UAE-based husband divorced her in 1988 and handed her an air ticket to Hyderabad.
In January, the two Dubai-based women reached Hyderabad and met DCP (south zone) V Satyanarayana. They requested him to help them trace their mother.
“They brought old photographs and sought our help. I promised to try our best. We circulated copies of the photos in the old city area. After asking hundreds of people and following many leads, we traced this woman,” Satyanarayana said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
UAE-based businessman Rasheed Obaid Masmary came to Hyderabad in 1981 in search of a bride. He married Nazia and a few months later, the couple went to Fujairah. On reaching there, Nazia found Rasheed was already married to another woman. She, however, decided to live with him.
Ayesha was born two years after her marriage and Fatima a year after her. In 1988, Rasheed gave her a triple talaq and sent Razia back to India. The daughters stayed with him. He later married another Hyderabadi woman and took her to UAE. The family later settled down in Dubai.

Two years after her return from UAE, Nazia’s family fixed her marriage with a fruit vendor from Bidar in Karnataka. She has two sons and a daughter from the second marriage.
The DCP said Additional DCP K Babu Rao met old Qazis and officials at shadi khanas with Nazia’s photos. “Her parents had passed away but one person remembered that a woman named Nazia was married to a rich UAE man by a qazi in Barkas. The qazi died years ago, but his son, who signed as witness, named two relatives of the bride as Ismail and Salim. After nearly three months, we found the duo. They led us to Nazia,” he said.
When an inspector met Nazia at her home, she could not recall much about her daughters. But she remembered that her younger daughter had six fingers. Police cross-checked the information and Fatima confirmed that she had a sixth finger that she got removed surgically a few years ago.
Following the confirmation, a meeting was fixed at the DCP’s office at Purani Haveli.
As Nazia waited there Thursday, Ayesha, her husband, their 10-year-old son, and Fatima reached the office. What followed was an emotional reunion as the two women embraced their mother. “We didn’t let go of her for half-an-hour or so,” they said.
“We never thought we would meet our mother in our lifetime,” Ayesha said.
“We did not even know which part of Hyderabad she was from. But, south zone police managed to find her. It is nothing short of a miracle,’’ Fatima said."

The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday released its poll manifesto named ‘Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra’ (Pledge for People’s Welfare) for UP Assembly polls. Speaking on the occasion, BJP President Amit Shah today said BIMARU (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, UP) states have improved, but not Uttar Pradesh. “Centre sanctioned Rs 1 lakh crore to UP, but no development is seen on ground. Law and order is at its nadir,” he said.

Slamming the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party for the state’s shoddy state of affairs and crumbling law and order situation, Shah said, “UP has been plundered by SP, BSP for 15 years. We have come with a pledge to transform state.” He also took on state CM Akhilesh Yadav and said he will have to answer for problems faced by

state where “ruling party goondas have grabbed land”, merely entering into alliance will not hoodwink people.

Shah also announced a slew of measures that will be taken by the BJP in UP, such as free laptops to all students ‘without any discrimination’, free wifi in all universities; special focus on Bundelkhand for its all round development, BJP to form teams at district levels to check exodus of people due to communal tension, food processing park to be set up in UP, 24 hours power to be supplied, slaughterhouses to be closed down in the state among others.
When asked about Triple Talaq, Shah said after eliciting views of women, BJP government will put up its opinion on the issue before the Supreme Court.

The BJP chief also said efforts will be made to ensure that Ram Temple is constructed under constitutional provisions, adding that a Special Task Force will also be set up to put an end to illegal mining in the state. Reacting to this announcement in particular, SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary told news agency ANI that Babri Masjid issue is still pending in the Supreme Court. He further added: “BJP needs to understand that UP cannot be turned into Gujarat; BJP has never done anything for the farmers; UP only trusts SP.”
Taking a cue from ruling Samajwadi Party, Shah promised to upgrade the Dial 100 of the state police to ensure police

help in 15 minutes all over the state. Stressing that if voted to power, his party will take one step ahead of the Samajwadi Party’s laptop distribution scheme by providing 1 GB free data for one year besides free wi-fi in universities.
To ensure the safety of college girls, innovative anti-Romeo squads will be set up near colleges to check eve-teasing. Besides, three women battalions will be raised for security of women, the document said."

Jamaat-e-Islami Hind chief and All India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-president Sayed Jalaluddin Umri today said the nationwide debate on the triple talaq issue was “unnecessary” and there will be no dispute if Muslims follow the Sharia law.
“There will be no dispute or discord if Muslims follow the Sharia law in true spirit with regard to the issues of marriage, divorce, inheritance, Mehar (right of a wife) and Nafqa (monthly stipend). The debate is unnecessary,” he said.
The muslim personal law is “balanced and justified” and it helps and promotes healthy family traditions, the Jamat chief told reporters here. It not only gives respect and freedom to women but also protects their dignity and rights, Umri said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Jamaat has set up 11 counselling centres and a helpine in Bihar to provide advice to Muslims with regard to marital problems.
“Jamaat has set up a helpline 0612-2370863 and also set up 11 counselling centres in Bihar, including in Patna to provide counselling to the people with regard to all types of marital and other related problems,” he said.
The centres will provide counselling to Muslim couples before marriage to make them aware about the Islamic laws on marital life, about provisions of muslim personal laws and related issues.
As part of the counselling programme, Jamaat’s volunteers and members will tell couples about the rights and duties of men and women and how to lead a marital life as per the Sharia law so that they can find solution as per it if problems arise, the Jamaat chief said.
Umri, who was accompanied by Jamaat’s Bihar unit chief Nayyaruzzma, was here as part of the organisation’s nationwide awareness campaign on the muslim personal law. The campaign was launched on April 23 and will come to an end on May 7 and workshops are being held as part of it."

Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin has welcomed the Allahabad High Court’s observations on the practice of triple talaq. “Islam as a religion does not sanction practices like this. Basically all religions, whether its is Hinduism or Islam, have discriminatory practices against women,” Taslima said in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday. “I also support the implementation of uniform civil code in a country like India,” Taslima said. She was speaking on the occasion of the launch of her new book “Exile: A Memoir”, which was held under high security.
Watch what else is making news:


“Governance and systems of justice have to be completely secular in content and practice. There should not be any controls for women at places of worship,” Taslima said. “I believe those women who wish to visit Sabarimala be allowed to worship at the temple. Why should menstruating women be discriminated against?”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She also commented on the recent controversy of whether to allow women wearing churidhar to enter Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala’s capital. “Why should there be dress code for women alone in temples and mosques?”
The exiled writer said: “I am not just secular, but am an atheist too. In a democracy, if people belonging to different religions can co-exist and have equal rights, why can’t atheists be granted the same status?”
“I have been travelling from country to country as I have been denied entry to my motherland. India is like an aunt. If you cannot be with your mother, the next best option is to be with your aunt. India with its colours, people and diversity is my home now. I want to live, work and die here. I could never relate to Europe and could not live there.”
She was critical of communists and the Trinamool Congress-led governments in West Bengal. She alleged that both had succumbed to pressure from ultra religious and radical groups and thereby denying her permission to live in West Bengal. “I have written a will stating that after my death, my body should be given to Kolkata Medical College, so that my mortal remains continue to be in Bengal,” Taslima said."

Just last week, he was stabbed in the back. There are many who bay for the blood of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s former schoolmate, mostly those who regard his liberal views on triple talaq as heresy.
The threats to Rashid and colleague Wagle—they edit the Hindi and Marathi editions of the same fiesty paper, Mahanagar—is evidence that Mumbai’s hardline edge is alive and sharp, even if it hasn’t been seen lately.
It’s been 11 years since Mumbai’s last full-blown murderous riots. Time and the great economic explosion—or so the theory went—was the great healer.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
‘‘Creative licence does not mean you insult the Holy Quran or our Prophet,’’ explains Sayeed Noorie, head of the Raza Academy, which is opposing a municipal proposal to make Vande Mataram a requirement in civic schools. ‘‘Mera mulk mujhe mehboob hai, lekin yeh mabood nahin ban sakta (my country is dear to us, but it cannot be our God),’’ declares Noorie. Sayeed Ahmed, editor, Urdu Times, whom Rashid blamed for the murderous attack on him last week, criticises attacks on journalists. 
Then, Ahmed asks: ‘‘Why are journalists like Wagle and Rashid targetted? There is certainly something wrong with them. They write with malicious intent — and inevitable dangers.’’ Ahmed’s newspaper has been targetting poet-scriptwriter Javed Akhtar for demanding the abolition of triple talaq. ‘‘The Urdu Times termed me an ‘enemy of Islam’ and wrote that I could harm the religion,’’ says Javed. 
Urdu commentator Hasan Kamal calls the attacks on Wagle and Rashid and—the generally hardening public stances—as a sign of coming elections and fundamentalist frustration with a peaceful status quo. Ranu Jain, a sociologist at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, believes the rise in fundamentalist noise is a complex issue, but stems in part from Mumbai’s collapsing support system."

Nor could there be any curb on the practice of triple talaq.
The board executive committee, meeting in Kanpur, decided to continue with the family laws adhered to so far while recognising the fact that triple talaq was a social ill which could not be corrected legally.
Speaking to reporters, Board president Maulana Syed Rabey Al-Hasani Nadvi said: ‘‘Our laws are based on divine inspiration and triple talaq comes from the same inspiration, that is, Shariat. We have no powers to amend or abolish it. So the triple talaq is irrevocable.’’https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
‘‘We did not take up the issue of right to divorce to a Muslim woman as five of the seven female members had objected to its inclusion in the nikahanama at our Bangalore meeting in 2000.’’
The Board members, who are all in their sixties (barring spokesperson Qasim Rasool Ilyas), held a closed-door meeting for nearly 10 hours. Eight of them — this did not include the lone woman member Dr Naseem Iqtidar Ali — sat to address the social reform issues pertaining to Muslim women.
The Board issued a curt statement on social reforms: ‘‘The executive meeting decided to launch a intensive campaign, appealing and persuading the community to follow the rules of Shariat in matters of marriage and termination of marriage by talaq, rights and obligation of husband and wife and inheritence.’’
‘‘The Board will take stock of the situation at the general body meeting which will be held in Calicut in Kerala in December 2004 and will decide about the targets and topics of reformation.’’
Nadvi, on his part, said: ‘‘You cannot codify human behaviour for every social ill. We had abolished untouchability by making a proper law over 50 years ago. Have we been able to abolish untouchability?’’.
He said the Board recognised the fact that triple talaq is bad but the Muslim society can find a solution to it only through social reforms. ‘‘Legal reform is not an answer to every social ill,’’ he maintained.
The Board also advocated that problem of talaq could effectively be handled, if both the parties — husband and wife — approach Darul Quza. Nadvi said that in Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand, the Darul Quza solved 18,000 talaq cases and in most, Muslim women benefitted.
Nadvi made it clear that the draft nikahanama was under consideration, but it would neither abolish the triple talaq nor grant Muslim women the right to divorce.
‘‘A Muslim woman has many other ways to part with her husband. If she proves atrocities of her husband before Darul Quza, she can easily get rid of him,’’ Nadvi said. Meanwhile, on the Babri Masjid issue, the Board has decided to wait for the court verdict. ‘‘The Supreme Court’s verdict will be binding on the Board and all the Muslims,’’ Nadvi said. On CBI cases, in which Advani was given a clean chit, the Board president said they may give their representation to the Union government.
The Board also decided that the UP government be approached to amend Zamindari Abolition Act to give rights of inheritence to daughters and mothers."

It says that “the revelation” that P. Chidambaram had “signed both the affidavits, claiming Ishrat to be JeM operative and later changing that stand, has just ratified that grand design”.
It asks “who were the unseen hands in hatching this conspiracy, were they limited to Congress” or do “the links go beyond”? The editorial says the NIA’s clarification that there is no evidence against Colonel Purohit in the train blast case is “startling”. About Purohit, it says that an “upright and able officer” has been in jail for more than seven years without trial.
Immediately after the incident, “the government had blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba”, but at a later stage “the names of some members of Hindu nationalist organisation called Abhinav Bharat cropped up”. The US Treasury department “declared Arif Qasmani”, an LeT operative, “to be involved in the attack”, but the UPA government overlooked these developments or deliberately concealed them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The editorial slams UPA’s home minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde, for coining “terms like ‘Hindu Terror’ or ‘Saffron Terror”. It also criticises Rahul Gandhi, who had “allegedly” told the then US ambassador that “radical Hindu groups may pose bigger threat than LeT in India”.
Muslim Reform

An article in the Organiser criticises the practice of divorce among Muslims, under which three words can be uttered by a “male chauvinist” to keep “an average Muslim woman enslaved and subjected… to the whims and fancies of her inconsiderate husband for centuries”. It underlines the struggle of Shayara Bano “who was given talaq after 13 years of married life”, after which she has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court. The petition says that “the custom of triple talaq is abominable and abrogates the fundamental rights of the Muslim women as citizens of Bharat”.
The Muslim women “always remain under psychological stress for the fear that they would be divorced on flimsy pretexts”. The article notes that even if the husband relents later, the woman “will have to face the ignoble situation” of “sleeping with someone else before returning to a man”. It criticises former PM Rajiv Gandhi, who “had virtually undone the Supreme Court verdict which could have brought about progressive changes in Muslim society” and “pushed the Muslim male society on the regressive path”.
Bharat & Mata

An article in Panchajanya underlines the custom of chanting “Bharat Mata ki Jai in ancient India” and slams “Muslim leaders”, especially historian Irfan Habib, who said that the idea of considering Bharat as Mata has “come from Europe”. It quotes a couplet of the Atharva Veda in which “a Hindu is asked to be completely dedicated towards Bharat Mata”. “I am the son of the earth, the earth is my mother,” it says. Any person can live in India and worship any god as this free-thinking is based on “progressive Vedic ideology”.
But how could anyone love this country if he rejected its culture, asks the article. “The Sanskrit word rashtra is a political-cultural concept that is different from the Western notion of nation and state,” it says, and quotes Sanskrit texts like the Vishnu Purana that says that “this land, which is created by gods and is spread from Himalaya to the Indian ocean, is Hindustan.”
“Our glorious rashtra is founded on spiritualism since time immemorial,” the article says and quotes Swami Rama Tirtha that “patriotism is practical Vedanta”. He had said, ‘’Bharatbhoomi is my body. Kanyakumari is my legs. Himalaya is my head.”"

OBSERVING THAT the judicial conscience is “disturbed”, the Allahabad High Court has held that triple talaq is “cruel” and asked whether the Muslim Personal law could be amended to alleviate the sufferings of Muslim women. The court has held that this form of “instant divorce” is “most demeaning”, which “impedes and drags India from becoming a nation”. “The question which disturbs the court is — should Muslim wives suffer this tyranny for all times? Should their personal law remain so cruel towards these unfortunate wives? Whether the personal law can be amended suitably to alleviate their sufferings? The judicial conscience is disturbed at this monstrosity,” a single judge bench of Justice Suneet Kumar said on November 5.
The court made the observations while dismissing a petition of one Hina (23) and her husband, who was 30 years her senior, and had married her “after effecting triple talaq to his wife”. “Muslim law, as applied in India, has taken a course contrary to the spirit of what the Prophet or the Holy Quran laid down and the same misconception vitiates the law dealing with the wife’s right to divorce,” said Kumar. He added: “The purpose of law in a modern, secular state… is to bring about social change. The Muslim community comprises a large percentage of Indian population, therefore, a large section of citizens, in particular women, cannot be left to be governed by archaic customs and social practice under the garb of personal law purportedly having divine sanction.”

“India is a nation in the making, geographical boundaries alone do not define a nation. It is to be adjudged, among others, on the parameter of overall human development and how the society treats its women; leaving such a large population to the whims and fancies of a personal law which perpetuates gender inequality and is regressive, is not in the interest of the society and the country. It impedes and drags India from becoming a nation,” the court remarked. It observed that “divorce is permissible in Islam only in case of extreme emergency”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“When all efforts for effecting a reconciliation have failed, the parties may proceed to a dissolution of marriage by Talaq or by Khola… The view that the Muslim husband enjoys an arbitrary, unilateral power to inflict instant divorce does not accord with Islamic injunctions. It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim husband enjoys, under the Quranic Law, unbridled authority to liquidate the marriage,” the court said. “The whole Quran expressly forbids a man to seek pretexts for divorcing his wife, so long as she remains faithful and obedient to him… The Islamic law gives to the man primarily the faculty of dissolving the marriage, if the wife, by her indocility or her bad character, renders the married life unhappy; but in the absence of serious reasons, no man can justify a divorce, either in the eye of religion or the law,” it added.
Hina and her husband, hailing from Bulandshahr district, had moved court seeking a direction to the police and Hina’s mother that they stop harassing the petitioners and their safety be ensured. The court made it clear that it was not disputing the contention of the petitioner’s counsel that the couple “are adults and are at liberty to choose their own partner” and they “cannot be deprived of their right to life and personal liberty”. “Nor difference in age is an issue”, it said.
However, it added: “What is disturbing is that the instrument of instant divorce (triple talaq) has been used for ulterior purpose (by the man) for divorcing his wife… first petitioner (the woman) left her family and joined the company of the second petitioner and consequently the second petitioner decided to get rid of his first wife.” Stating that it would “not like to say anything further as the Supreme Court is seized of the matter”, the court added that “the legality of the marriage or divorce and rights of parties is kept open”. It went on to dismiss the petition."

Vaidya claimed that the younger generation was getting attracted towards the RSS as it had received nearly 65,000 online requests to join the organisation in the last six months, which he said was 35 per cent more, compared to the same period last year."

The Supreme Court on Thursday referred the triple talaq issue to the constitution bench. The hearing in the case will begin on May 11. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi plea to hear the case before the summer vacation was rejected by the apex court. A five-member bench will be constituted by the top court to hear the matter. A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud said the petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy practiced by Muslims will be head by the larger bench during the summer vacation.
The controversial divorce practice involves the husband repeating the word “talaq” three times. The Supreme Court will be hearing a clutch of petitions demanding a ban on the practice. Earlier, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) opposed the petitions, claiming that it would infringe their religious beliefs. The said the petitions were not maintainable as the issues do not fall under the ambit of judiciary. According to news agency ANI, the practice has been abolished by many Muslim-majority countries such as Pakistan and Indonesia.

Last year, the Centre had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims. The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court. The apex court had taken suo motu cognizance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in the event of divorce or due to other marriages of their husband.

The JD(U) Sunday accused the BJP of raking up the triple talaq issue “just to communalise” UP Assembly polls, adding that it could also attempt a “shila poojan” even though the Ayodhya temple and Babri Masjid dispute was before the Supreme Court.

On the opening day of its two-day national council meet in Rajgir, the JD(U) formally endorsed the selection of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as party national president. Describing Nitish as “mahanayak (super hero)” of 2015 Bihar Assembly polls, the party authorised him to explore ways to “replicate the Bihar Grand Alliance model at the national level”. It also authorised Nitish Kumar to bring about necessary amendments in the party constitution to help expand JD(U)’s base beyond Bihar.
Speaking to the media after the first day’s session, JD (U) national spokesperson KC Tyagi said: “We have endorsed selection of Nitish Kumar to the party national president’s post. We discussed several issues confronting the country. We want to ask why the BJP has been discussing triple talaq. There are ways to discuss it internally among the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), clerics and cultural and social bodies. Why is the BJP discussing it now? They just want to communalise UP elections.”
“The atmosphere in UP is communally charged. There have been talks of shila pujan even when the Ayodhya matter has been before Supreme Court. Why have there been no talks on unemployment in states like Bihar and Chhattisgarh?” he said."

The Delhi Police have reportedly not found any comprehensive evidence to pursue its sedition case against former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar. On February 9 last year, Kanhaiya was jailed on charges of sedition, along with JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, who are currently out on bail. The police, however, are likely to indict Khalid and Bhattacharya, according to a draft charge-sheet accessed by The Times of India. (READ MORE)

A day after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board slammed the government for its stand on the practice of triple talaq, Congress leader and former Law Minister M Veerappa Moily Friday asked the Muslim community to “think of reforming themselves” so that the “axe of law” does not fall on them. He said religions will have to introspect and reform in every field “civilisation warrants” and “triple talaq is one such area where reform is necessary”.
Moily’s party has been cautious about taking a stand on the triple talaq issue, realising it could be on a slippery slope, especially in Uttar Pradesh where assembly elections are due early next year. The Congress merely said it has full faith in the Supreme Court which has always safeguarded rights of women.
Maintaining “it is impossible to implement” a uniform civil code “in a multi-cultural, multi-racial and multi-dimensional country like India”, Moily, however, told The Indian Express that rigid practices should change as time advances.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Any reform in any religion will have to come from within. It is always difficult to impose it by law. I think as civilisation advances, each one and each religion will have to introspect and make reforms in whichever field civilisation warrants. I don’t think we can have very rigid practices. Triple talaq is one such area where reform is necessary,” he said.
“It is a question of humanity. Having three wives, I don’t think, any religion can propagate it. Even in so far as Islam is concerned, they are also not propagating it. Many Muslim countries don’t practice triple talaq… So, instead of waiting for a public debate and waiting for a law to tell us what should be done, it is high time our Muslim brothers and sisters think of reforming themselves, so that the axe of law will not fall on them,” he said.
On the uniform civil code, Moily said it was not implementable. “It is impossible to implement it in a multi-cultural, multi-racial and multi-dimensional country like India. And anybody who thinks it is a communal agenda, then they are wrong. This cannot be a Hindu-vs-Islam or Islam-vs-Hindu. Multiple practices are available… Any number of tribals we have in the country, they have their own personal laws. Many of the backward classes… for example, some of the families, in fact a majority of the families in my district that is Dakshina Kannada, and Udupi and also in coastal Kerala, we have the marumakkathayam (matrilineal inheritance) practice… through a uniform civil code, you cannot bulldoze them,” he said.
He said the uniform civil code cannot just be viewed in the context of Muslims. “This is a question of practices of many communities, hundreds of communities in India. So when you address uniform civil law, you cannot just limit it only to Muslims. Or the Hindus only. Hindu, as such, is not a religion in our country. Hindu consists of components of various communities… So there is no such thing… a clear demarcation of Hindu vs Muslim. Within Hindus, there are many practices. It has to be acknowledged.”
“Even though, we have incorporated it in the Constitution of India… we could not implement it. Many debates have taken place. It is not the first time the Law Ministry has come out with it. Even during B R Ambedkar’s days as Law Minister, he wanted to do this. But he could not do it. Because the social landscape is such… the country should think of its priority. If you really want to reform the country socially, the first thing to be addressed is a casteless society. If you are bold, as a reformer in Hindu. Hindus should also be very reformative,” he said.
“Peaceful reforms have taken place in the past. Many bad practices like Sati have been given up. But there are still more fundamental bad practices like casteism. Basically, our Hindu society itself is unequal. Suppose, had Buddhism prevailed all over the country, casteism would have gone long back. But Buddhism was resisted only for these reasons. So that is why today we need to think of creating an equal society. Equal society cannot be done by enforcing a law like uniform civil code. And ironically, we often call it is not a union of states, but a union of castes. It is true also… I don’t think uniform civil code is a priority today,” he said.
Hitting out at the BJP, he said the ruling party wants to “communalise” the country to hide the government’s “failures” on development, defence and economic fronts. “So they think that for UP, they have issues like this. Even though they know very well that it cannot be implemented. They will not do it. This is not the first time these debates are coming up. It has been debated and debated and put to rest. People should understand the game of the present government. There is no sincerity on their part. They believe in fragmentation of society, not unity of society,” he said.
At the Congress briefing Friday, party spokesperson Shobha Oja avoided taking a stand. “As far as triple talaq is concerned, the matter is sub judice. And we have full faith in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has always safeguarded the rights of women of our country. So we will wait for the decision of the Supreme Court. We have full confidence in the Supreme Court,” she said."
"1617716992-25","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","All eyes on the Muslim law board","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/all-eyes-on-the-muslim-law-board/","All eyes on the Muslim law board","July 3, 2004","Wonders never cease. Suddenly, hard-as-nails maulanas, who had declared that the Shariat was immutable, dismissed the demand for maintenance to divorced wives with a curt “we don’t pay service charges”, and decried the fuss about instant talaq as a non-issue, are endorsing a standard nikahnama which makes talaq conditional, and proclaiming that Islam is a flexible religion, in which the only immutable component is the Koran.
It has taken a long time. In 1994, shaken by the 92-93 riots and faced with yet another controversy on the validity of instant talaq, a group of Mumbai Muslims started working on a model nikahnama, or marriage contract. Their aim was to ensure that the wife got the rights guaranteed by the Koran, but denied to her under the Indian version of Muslim Personal Law.

They were a diverse lot: an ex-judge, senior lawyers, a qazi, academics and activists, all rooted in their community, two of them even members of the Muslim Personal Law Board. The group took pains to draw upon nikahnamas already existing among various sects, and involve respected ulema in the framing process so that all possible religious objections could be countered. Getting ulema to discuss the Shariat with Muslim women who didn’t wear purdah (except one) wasn’t easy. But the women found the ulema more than co-operative, once they were convinced about the group’s Islamic bona fides.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This entire time-consuming and delicate exercise was conducted without the media getting wind of it. Even a single sensational headline on triple talaq would have triggered off a defensive wall, blocking access to the entity the group hoped to reach: the Muslim Personal Law Board. Once the Board publicly endorsed the nikahnama, it would be easier for the qazis, who perform marriages, and the imams, who deliver Friday sermons, to push it. When it was finally ready, the nikahnama was a truly inspiring document, which not only broke the impasse on Muslim Personal Law created by the fallout of the 1985 Shah Bano judgment, but also resolved all contentious issues: polygamy, talaq, mehr and maintenance, without deviating from the Koran. In its long journey to its destination, it had been sent  to over 1,000 ulema, approved by the Aligarh-based Fiqah Academy, had its approval challenged, presented wherever Muslim women had converged.

All these years, this nikahnama has been discussed at every important meet of the Board at the exhortation of its women members. Yet, when the Board meets on Sunday, the document they will hopefully ratify won’t be the 1994 nikahnama, but one drafted by the Board itself. Why wasn’t the ’94 nikahnama accepted? The reasons range from the dominating presence of women among the framers, to the threats it posed to the prerogatives taken for granted by Muslim men, simply by treating women as the Koran had ordained: as human beings with human rights. Some ulema insisted that instant talaq — howsoever deplorable — remained a valid form of divorce; others feared that delegating to women the right to divorce would make them licentious; yet others declared that the right to marry again could not be made conditional.

Then there was the practical difficulty: how could subjects such as divorce and polygamy be discussed while entering into a marriage? The girl’s family could not mention such matters, and the boy’s family never would. Ironically, the one man convinced that the nikahnama’s time had come, was its chief from 2000-2002: Maulana Mujahidul Islam Qasimi. Pessimistic about it being approved by everyone, he advised the group to start using it. But without the Board’s official approval, nobody was ready to bell the cat. How is it then that the Board has itself come out with a nikahnama which includes two of the most controversial points: replacing instant talaq with the phased-out consultative procedure advised by the Koran, and giving women the right to divorce without losing their mehr, albeit through a qazi?

The catalysts for this change have been many: the 1998 meeting with the National Commission of Women, of which Syeda Hameed was a member; the spate of judgments upholding the rights of Muslim wives; and last year’s debate over a Uniform Civil Code in which, for the first time, mainstream Muslim men asked for reform. But none of these would have worked had one long awaited development not taken place: the ordinary Muslim woman had at last gained the confidence to be vocal about her rights.

Now, the usual suspects have already started making the expected noises against the nikahnama. Even if the Board caves in once again, Muslim women will ensure the retreat won’t last too long."

Noted Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen on Wednesday slammed those who are boycotting Pakistani artistes, saying terrorists should be banned not artistes, and cautioned that such actions were similar to Hitler’s idea of ‘blood purity’. In a series of tweets, Taslima, who is living in exile in India after facing death threats from fundamentalists in Bangladesh, said, “Ban terrorists. Don’t ban artists. Artistes belong to the places where art is honoured.

“Today you ban Pakistani artists. Tomorrow you ban Bangladeshi writers. You will live with yourselves. ‘Pure Indian’ blood. Hitler’s idea of ‘blood purity’.”
Hitler, who led Germany during World War II, propagated the idea of a “pure Aryan race” supremacy under Nazism, leading to the killings of millions of Jews and ban on mixed marriages.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tasleema’s came a day after filmmaker Karan Johar said he will not “engage with talent” from Pakistan in future and made a fervent appeal against stalling his upcoming film ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ that features Fawad Khan.
In the aftermath of the Uri terror attack last month in which 19 Indian jawans were killed, the MNS issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave India. They also threatened to stop the screening of films featuring artistes from Pakistan.
Subsequently, Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association passed a motion to ban the artistes from the neighbouring country.
The Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India recently decided not to screen the films with Pakistani actors in four states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa.
On Tuesday, Taslima had also tweeted on the issue of triple talaq saying, “No religious law is good. Better to have strict separation between religion & state. Uniform civil code based on equality & justice urgently necessary.”"

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Saturday alleged that attempts are being made to “interfere” in Shariat laws through courts and appealed to the NDA government to maintain the stand of “non-interference in such matters” as was adopted by the previous governments.
The AIMPLB working committee passed a resolution to this effect in a day-long meeting at Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Lucknow. The board will send the resolution to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for continuing with the stand of “non-interference by courts and government in Muslim personal law” in two cases currently pending in the Supreme Court, board member Zafaryab Jilani said.

His remarks comes weeks after the Supreme Court sought the Centre’s response in a plea challenging the constitutionality of Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and nikah halala (by which a Muslim man is not allowed to remarry his divorced wife if she did not marry another man after she was divorced). The plea has been moved by one Saira Banu who wants triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy declared illegal, calling them in violation of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Constitution.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Jilani said the board will also prepare its stand with the help of Ulamas (Islamic law scholars) and submit it before the Supreme Court. He said the board will inform the apex court that Islam allows women to remarry, allows widow remarriage and has even regularised divorce.
To a query, Jilani said issues like chanting of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” were not discussed as they are not related to the personal law. He, however, added that Deen Bachao-Dastoor Bachao (save religion and constitution) campaign started by the board last year against the “imposition of surya namaskar and yoga” in Rajasthan government’s schools, will continue. He said wherever there are any such attempts to force the education of a particular religion in the government schools, the board will campaign there.
He said earlier programmes under the campaign had attracted a large number of non-Muslims who are not in favour of changing the secular nature of education in government schools.
Responding to a question, Jilani said the decision to run the campaign started over the apprehension that there could be interference in the Muslim personal law after the formation of new government at the Centre. He said uniform civil code is often advocated by BJP spokespersons and this raises the fear that the government will also support it.
Jilani said officiating AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani was elevetaed as general secretary in the meeting, which was presided by its chairperson Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadwi and also attended by All India Muslim Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of the board’s working committee.
Meanwhile, responding to a question about BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj reportedly comparing Muslim women “to shoes”, which can be removed anytime, Jilani said though such personal statements are never discussed in board meetings, his personal view is that the Unnao MP does not have any knowledge about Islam.
Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali said the BJP MP’s remarks are unfortunate and shows that he does not know about the pro-women nature of Islam. He said it is expected that the BJP leadership will ask its members to not make such comments."

Speaking at a seminar organised by Majlis, member of the MPLB, Uzma Nahid today said that while a rough draft of the nikahnama has been formalised, a few issues still needed to be discussed with the religious leaders and ulemas of the country.
“One of the major concerns of the ulemas is that this nikahnama will be delegating to the woman the right to divorce, albeit on certain conditions. Though within the tenets of Islamic law, this was not in common practice till now. What worries them is that the provision could be misused just as men too are misusing it,” said Nahid, later speaking to Indian Express.
The progress – what is being talked about as a major achievement- towards a standardised nikahnama comes after, as Nahid informed, almost twenty to twenty five years of work in this regard. It is expected that the nikahnama would specify a talaq-e-ehsun procedure for divorce, where talaq is pronounced in three sittings over a three-month period, so as to give the couple time to reconcile. This is expected to be an effective way to wipe out the malaise of the itriple-talaq procedure, where talaq is pronounced thrice in one sitting. Most Muslim women today find themselves hapless victims of the `triple-talaq procedure, which though sanctioned under the Islamic law, say Muslim scholars, is being used irresponsibly, leaving women with no scope for arbitration or reconciliation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Triple-talaq is not banned since no Islamic tenet can be banned by any authority” said Nahid, “but with the procedure of pronouncing talaq over a three-month period being stipulated, it is expected that the practice of giving talaq in one sitting would fade away”.
While all Muslim marriages have a nikahnama, these clauses that have the sanction of the MPLB, would be incorporated for the first time. Till now, most nikahnamas did not go beyond the question of mehr. Though that could be changing. At the seminar, High Court advocate Niloufer Akhtar narrated how she had recently drawn up a contract between two parties where the wife kept a condition that she would divorce if the husband migrated to another country.
“Right now, we are concerned about the basic stipulations that should be there in such contracts, later if individuals want, they can add to it,” said Nahid. She remarked that under the format being formalised, they would like to give options to the bride on the form of mehr she wanted – whether in gold or silver, cash or property.
The nikahnama is also expected to safeguard the interests of the first wife if the husband decides to go in for a second marriage. This will include conditions that a husband will have to meet, like giving the matrimonial house to the first wife and that her children be paid the same attention as was before the second marriage.
As for seeking arbitration on a matrimonial dispute, Nahid said that the MPLB has set up three Islamic courts – Darrulqaza – in the city of Mumbai, where muftis, would settle disputes. There is scope for lawyers to intervene and she is trying to have a woman counsellor on the premises of the court so that women find it easier to speak in confidence."

These and countless such testimonies recorded during nation-wide public hearings by the National Commission for Women (NCW) over the past 18 months, are contained in the first-ever national status report on the condition of Muslim women released by the NCW last week.
Entitled `Voice Of The Voiceless’, the report authored by NCW member Syeda Hameed, lays bare the double exploitation suffered by Muslim women in India. On the one hand, their educational and employment status is among the lowest in the country and on the other, they are denied their rightful due under the Muslim Personal Law, either through misinterpretation of the law by the conservative sections or through ignorance of their rights.
""We want to hold up a mirror to the Muslim society and jolt the enlightened sections into doing something about the injustice done to often poor and illiterate women in the name of the personal law,"" Hameed said.
In major recommendations forwarded to the Centre, the NCW has advocated immediate banning of the verbal triple talaq, stringent provisions to curb polygamy and measures to correct the ""injustice"" done to Muslim women by the 1986 Muslim Women (Protection Of Rights On Divorce) Act.
Describing the educational status of Muslim women as among the worst in the country, with even Dalit women doing better, the NCW has called for imparting education and creating awareness on a war footing.
""In hearing after hearing, the Commission observed that the abuses of personal law and bruises of family violence are ultimately rooted in their (women’s) lack of education. No education and widespread ignorance has made them blind to the abuse of their personal laws which are used as instruments of torture rather than as celebration of their rights,"" said Hameed in the report.
Stressing the need to reform the implementation of the Personal Law, the report noted that while several Muslim countries had moved to prohibit or restrict verbal triple talaq, the practice continued unabated."

(File)
Ban triple talaq, punish men who give divorce arbitrarily and allow women to seek divorce–these are some of the demands over which the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) has decided to petition the Supreme Court.
Underlining that instantaneous talaq is in contravention of tenets of Quran, President of AIMWPLB Shaista Amber has sought punishment for those men who give triple talaq so it could act as a deterrent.
“Quran says there must be time for reconciliation between partners. It says when a man gives talaq he must pause and consult his wife. Otherwise, triple talaq is like a hanging dagger for muslim women,” Shaista said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

AIMWPLB has also sought a ban on “nikah halala”, where a woman who has been divorced through triple talaq has to marry another man and consummate her marriage with him before being eligible to remarry her ex-husband.
The board is also in favour of women being allowed to practise Khula- a form of divorce initiated by the wife, which is effected with the return of her husband’s wedding gift.
Shaista said while Quran gives the right to divorce to women, there is a need for greater awareness among muslim women about it.
The President of AIMWPLB also hit out at All India Mulsim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) for defending triple talaq in the Supreme Court. The AIMPLB had told the SC recently that triple talaq was “better than murder” as otherwise husbands could kill their wives in order to get rid of them.
“The intent behind their petition lacks empathy, fairness. They should have said that they are in favour of giving justice to women,” said Shaista.
Shaista said her organisation was opposed to a Uniform Civil Code. “When we have Sharia, there is no need for a Uniform Civil Code”."

(File Photo)
Praising Assam’s teen singer Nahid Afrin for standing up to a ‘fatwa’ asking her to stay away from performing in the public, the Shiv Sena said Friday such diktats sprang from a “medieval and pervert mindset.” In an editorial in the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said, “The courage shown by Nahid has to be appreciated. But, appreciation alone is not enough. All sections of the society need to come together and back her stand.”

It said that ‘fatwas’ issued in Islamic countries have also proved to be irrelevant as women are working in the fields of theatre and cinema there. “Fatwas, which are a result of medieval and pervert mindset, have darkened the lives of women in Islam. Triple talaq has reduced women to mere maids and have rendered them helpless,” the Sena said.
“The Sena, along with nationalists, will surely back Nahid. But we are surprised at those who talk of freedom of speech and tolerance, have nothing to say about this incident,” it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even Bollywood, that is the first to give its opinion, does not speak anything for Nahid, the edit said.
16-year-old Nahid made her Bollywood singing debut for Sonakshi Sinha in 2016 film ‘Akira’.
The fatwa, issued earlier this week, asked the reality TV show ‘Indian Idol’ junior finalist to keep away from a music programme on March 25, saying that the event is “against Sharia”.
The diktat was circulated through pamphlets which was widely distributed among public across Hojai and Nagaon districts in central Assam.
Printed in Assamese and carrying names of 46 clerics, organisations and individuals, the leaflets had asked Nahid to keep away from entertainment events saying they “corrupt” future generations and make them liable to “Allah’s wrath”.
Nahid, however, has maintained that music is God’s gift to her and she “will never bow to it (such warnings) and never leave singing.”
The Class X student from Assam is scheduled to participate in a music show to be held at Udali Sonai Bibi College in Lanka area of Nagaon district on March 25.
Several prominent personalities from the minority community, students and ethnic organisations as well as ULFA faction in peace talks with the Centre, have condemned the ‘fatwa’ and urged Nahid to continue singing fearlessly."

In a bid to lure voters in the five states which are going polls, all the top political parties have promised various schemes in their manifestos. Unfortunately however, in most of their proposed pledges, women’s issues have been dwarfed in their importance and have barely received attention. When it came to addressing what the parties would do for women, most of them displayed lack of originality. They all echoed one prominent feature: providing a 33 percent reservation for women in government jobs. Besides this, freebies from cooking stoves to bicycles have been offered to women and girls respectively.
Here’s a snapshot of the key things each party promised women in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
UTTAR PRADESH
Uttar Pradesh, currently run by Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, has been notorious for its abysmal law and order situation. Violence against women is at its peak, and a CAG report showed a 61 percent spike from 2011-2015 in UP, where according to the state and union-territory data, the state had reported a high women’s rights violation in 2015, with 6,110 reported incidents (http://bit.ly/2lfvsNM). Safety for women therefore, is a crucial concern in Uttar Pradesh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Samajwadi Party – Congress

In the aftermath of the father-son battle within the Samajwadi Party, an uncanny alliance between SP and Congress emerged. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav released the SP’s manifesto in January. In its manifesto, Akhilesh has promised that self-defence training institutions for women will be set up and that all districts will have women police stations. Along with this it has promised free bicycles to girl students between classes 9 and 12. For working women in particular, hostels would be built in many cities.
The party has also promised that Rs 2 lakh (along with a house), would be given to those who’d marry “orphans, disabled and widows”. Rather than giving men what practically seems like a bribe, this money should be invested in setting up skill development centers for women who are socially or physically unaccepted by society.

Bharatiya Janata Party

In its manifesto called the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra, BJP has promised a referendum of sorts over triple talaq. BJP’s President Amit Shah voiced that if the party comes to power, it would conduct a survey, asking all the Muslim women in UP about their stance on triple talaq. “The issue is pending in court,” he said. “However, once the BJP comes to power, the state government would take opinion of Muslim women on the issue and, if need be, would become a party in the ongoing case, presenting the opinion of the Muslim women from the state.” In addition, in its manifesto, the party also mentioned that as state government, education will be provided for free to girls till graduation. For protection of women, a special women police force will be put together and it would also establish 100 fast-track courts to address women’s concerns.

*Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party has decided not to release a manifesto yet, claiming that its fulfillment of the previous promises it made validated the party’s expertise in running for governance and winning.
PUNJAB
The 2011 Census showed that Punjab has an alarming sex ratio – 895. With regard to crimes against women, the situation in Punjab is worrisome (http://bit.ly/2kmzItr). Back in 2015, till August 31, there were 1,054 dowry cases reported in Punjab, along with 826 molestation incidents and 597 rape incidents.

Congress

In its 120-page manifesto, apart from suggesting that it will provide 33 percent quota to women for government jobs as well as educational institutes, the party stated that “reservation for women in PRIs and ULBs (PLEASE EXPAND) would be raised to 50 per cent” as well. Focusing on education, it mentions that education would be provided for free to girls from class I to PhD level. Farmer suicide is a grave issue in Punjab. Tying that with women’s concerns, Congress states that if voted to power, the widows of suicide victims will be taught and equipped with skills for employment, while their children will be provided with free education (including hostel lodging).
While it has mentioned that it will “ensure safe cities for all women”, it hasn’t outlined precisely how it will go about doing so. Domestic violence victims however, will be given free psychological counseling, legal and medical services by establishing Crisis Centers in all districts.

On January 24, 2017, the Shiomani Akali Dal unveiled its pledges to voters. In its 52 page manifesto (http://bit.ly/2kgVpZJ), women’s issues do not have a separate, dedicated section – while there are separate chapters dedicated to reiterating and restating the importance of “Preserving Our Rich Sacred Heritage” and “Promotion of Punjabi Language and Culture”.
While, through its manifesto, the Akali Dal assures an increase in its women empowerment’s Shagun scheme from Rs 15,000 to Rs 51,000, it also promises to provide a 33 per cent reservation to women in government jobs. If voted, the party would also raise the funds for girl child assistance from Rs. 61,000 to Rs. 1,25,000.

Branching out of Delhi and contesting for state elections in Punjab and Goa for the first time, AAP has promised that it would provide 33 per cent reservation for women in government jobs. For women’s safety, it proposed opening training centers which would equip women with skills to join the state and central police forces.

Looking at the competitive industry for women entrepreneurs, it also stated that a five-year tax holiday would be given to them. Acutely aware of facing a stiff competition from both the Akali Dal-BJP alliance and Congress, AAP’s women wing chief, Baljinder Kaur told The Indian Express that women safety and other concerns would play a significant part in AAP’s agenda. “From safety and dignity of women to making her financially independent, we will include everything in our women’s manifesto. Unlike Congress, our manifesto hasn’t been made sitting in AC rooms but by talking to women at grassroots. It will be launched after Dalits’ manifesto and we are still in process of holding dialogues with women. Like Delhi, installing CCTV cameras in buses and other places will be top priority,” she said."

For the first time in over 15 years, the Uttar Pradesh BJP unit is holding a state executive meeting in Lucknow in May as the ruling party. “It has yet to be decided whether the meeting will be held on both May 1 and 2, but it is sure that it will be held on May 2 because party national president is reaching Lucknow to address the gathering,” said a senior BJP leader.
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath — who earlier used to skip state executive meetings — will attend the meeting this time, as will party national president Amit Shah, who will be there to address the concluding session. The party has decided to hold the meeting at the Scientific Convention Centre in the old city area, for which Union ministers from the state, MPs and state Cabinet ministers have been invited.
The previous executive meeting was held in Jhansi in August last year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In the meet, state executive members will be told about the resolutions passed in the party’s recent national executive meeting, concluded in Bhubaneshwar earlier this week. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged in that meeting to work relentlessly for socio-economic transformation of society and address the concerns of Muslim women not by creating conflict but through discussions, the state executive may also pass a resolution in this regard. The Adityanath government already has decided to start an exercise for collecting opinions from Muslim women on triple talaq.
“The political resolution in the meeting will be related to preparations for upcoming local body elections, and praising the decisions that the Yogi Adityanath government has taken to fulfil promises made in the BJP’s Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra,” said a BJP leader. Another leader said executive committee members will express gratitude to workers across the state for their contribution in Assembly polls success, as it will be the first meeting after the elections.Lucknow NewsClose aide of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari held in ambulance case‘Abducted’ Aligarh girl found living on rent in BulandshahrCovid resurgence: With nearly 4,000 cases a day, patient count climbs to 22,820Click here for more

Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said BJP would not “fish in troubled waters” of Uttar Pradesh and dismissed as “totally false” allegation that his party had a hand in fueling the ongoing feud in the ruling Samajwadi Party. The Minister for Urban Development and Information and Broadcasting said Samajwadi Party is suffering from its own internal bickering, infights, family trouble, and is not able to control its own leaders and “it’s a battle within the family for supremacy.”

“….(SP is) not able to control their own party and sort out their problems, they are dragging the name of BJP into the controversies that BJP is hand-in-glove with some leaders of Samajwadi Party. This is totally false. We do not believe in fishing in troubled waters,” Venkaiah told a press conference here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He likened the developments in SP to “how dynasty can become nasty” and added that (a film) picture is going on in Uttar Pradesh for the entire country to see.
The senior leader also alleged that seeing the growing popularity of the BJP in UP, both SP and BSP are not only rattled and jittery, but are indulging in false propaganda against his party.
“Now, BSP Chief (Mayawati), who thrives on communal and casteist agenda criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP and alleged that we are trying to impose ‘Sankirna, Sampradayak va Kattarwadi’ (narrow, communal and fundamentalist) agenda of the RSS,” he said.
“It is in everybody’s knowledge that this description suits BSP better than anybody else as it thrives on caste and communal calculations and combinations,” he alleged.
“Is the BSP opposed to ending discrimination against Muslim women? Is it opposed to the rights of Muslim women? Is it against equal treatment of Muslim women? Is freedom of conscience, free profession, practice and propagation of religion means injustice to women of a particular community,” the minister asked.
“Let the SP, BSP and the Congress come clean on their stand on abolition of Triple Talaq,” he said."

“Do we admire them for their patience, or do we lament their acceptance?” he said, while delivering the 10th V M Tarkunde Memorial Lecture in Delhi. The lecture was instituted in the memory of the human rights activist and the eminent lawyer who defended many activists and journalists jailed during the Emergency.
During the lecture titled ‘India versus India’, Gopalkrishna said we are now “living in a country where the State is extremely sensitive to criticism and where intolerance seems to be a miasma that rolls down from the houses of power in Delhi to the gullies of all its cities.” He said that an intolerant state can be opposed “with great difficulty” but an intolerant society “has to be opposed with even greater difficulty”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said various divisions that have existed within the country were signs of India versus India. “Partition redrew India’s map. Polarisation is redrawing India’s mind,” he said.
“The extremists of the both sides of the Hindu-Muslim divide are at it, and vigorously.”
He said “India versus India” is nowhere more visible today than in the demands for the uniform civil code. “The surge in the Hindu right’s compassion for Muslim women will sound less unconvincing if it is accompanied by simultaneous concern for gender rights in India across religions,” he said.

The opponents of triple talaq, he said, should also oppose “the obscuring of Muslims, the dispelling of Muslims, the expelling of Muslims” from the Indian polity and society.
“Homogenising diversity is not a step in equality, it is a design in domination,” he said."

BJP PRESIDENT Amit Shah on Saturday hit out at the Opposition for opposing demonetisation, accusing them of stalling the Winter Session of the Parliament just to sidestep discussion on funding of political parties.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured discussion and change in fund raising process of political parties during the all-party meeting at the beginning of Winter Session and said all elections from panchayat to Parliament should be held on the same day,” Shah said at his party’s Parivartan rally in Shahjahanpur.

He added: “But the Opposition did not allow a discussion in the entire Winter Session. They do not have any intention of wiping out blackmoney from politics. Modiji has put forward a view, and I want to appeal to leaders of all Opposition parties that and we should accept discussion on it to bring probity in politics.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Continuing his attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said only those whose “billions have been reduced to trash” are feeling the pain. “Have you seen the faces of Mamata (Banerjee) and Mayawati… their faces have lost glow, they have started looking 10 years older in a day,” he said. In one stroke of the PM, drug dealers, fake currency racketeers, naxalites and terrorists have been set right, he added.
Shah went on to list BJP’s “achievements” at the Centre, including power to villages, LPG connections to women and reducing cost of fertilizers.
Speaking on tripal talaq, Shah said: “For the Modi government, religion comes after women’s security and triple talaq should be banned.”
“After the Centre clearly stated its views in the Supreme Court against it, the SP, BSP and Congress have all gone silent,” Shah said while appealing to women voters to question these parties on what they are doing for women’s rights and whether they agree on triple talaq when they come seeking votes.
“Should Mulsim women get their rights or not? Modi has worked towards securing the rights of women in the country,” Shah asserted.
Attacking the ruling SP and Congress’ possible alliance for the 2017 state polls, Shah said: “Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has been saying for a month that SP will get majority in alliance with Congress… This indicates that Akhilesh is feeling defeated. He is dreaming of winning with Rahul baba, who will set up potato factory in western UP.”
“Even if all parties come together, the people of UP have decided to vote BJP to power,” he added.
Stressing that development of UP is possible only when BJP is voted to power with a two-thirds majority, Shah termed SP and BSP as family and caste-based parties, which cannot work for development of the entire society. “It has been either ‘chacha-bhatija’ or ‘bua-bhatija’ who have been harming the state’s development in the past 15 years,” he said, referring to UP SP chief Shivpal Yadav, Akhilesh and BSP supremo Mayawati.
Akhilesh was not allowing the benefits of the central schemes to reach the people as it would increase the popularity of central government, Shah claimed. “The benefits of Fasal Bima Yojana could not reach the beneficiaries as there was a tiff for commission between the chahcha and bhatija,” he claimed."

Filed by senior advocate Badar Sayeed,who was a Tamil Nadu MLA from 2006 to 2011,the petition argues for the need to codify Muslim personal law,calls for arbitration and witnesses before a marriage can be declared annulled,and challenges the triple talaq tradition.
The court has sent notices to the Centre,the secretary of the Tamil Nadu backward classes and minorities department,and the chief qazi of the state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sayeed has been under tremendous pressure to withdraw the petition and not undermine qazis publicly. With the petition she has appended several certificates issued by qazis in Tamil Nadu that arbitrarily decreed talaq as certified and formal. She has stressed that there should be a Muslim Marriage Bill like the Hindu Marriage Bill,so that Muslim women are no longer at the mercy of qazis. She points out that in no other faith can the priest solemnising a marriage simply nullify it.
I am not asking for a uniform civil code. But in my experience with several women as an MLA,as head of the state minorities commission and with my social work, says Sayeed,also the first woman to head the state Waqf Board,I see Muslim womens Achilles heel as being the ability of the qazi to simply,sometimes without even her knowledge,let alone with due process,decide that her marriage has been annulled. 
Since her petition,some 100 persons have picketed outside her house in Alwarpet while several delegations from Muslim organisations have been pressuring her to withdraw it,anxious that the debate about qazis and Muslim womens rights doesnt play out in court.
I have been asked not to wash our dirty linen in public, she says. She adds that she has made it clear that she is keen that anyone who has arguments against her petition should take these up in court.
Her eight-page petition argues that the lack of codification has meant no set rules and convenient interpretations have enabled Muslim men to easily divorce without any consideration for the women they marry. The argument that it is anti-Shariah to question the triple talaq or procedures of divorce is an excuse for men to carry on.
How is asking for equal and a proper system for divorce for Muslim women and contesting the triple Talaq anti-Shariah? she says. I have been told by several people that asking for this codification means its a first step towards a uniform civil code. They have not understood what I am trying to do. 
In 1986,when the Supreme Court ruled for extra maintenance for a Muslim divorcee,Shah Bano,Parliament came under severe pressure from Muslim clerics and was forced to overturn the judgment on the plea that it amounted to interference in Muslim personal affairs. The matter snowballed into a major political fault-line,coinciding with a BJP rath yatra.
Earlier this year,a group of lawyers and activists including the late Asghar Ali Engineer had argued for a fair and standardised nikahnama,which would take care of the concerns of Muslim women,often made to accept less favourable terms before the marriage,and later should it come to divorce. Sayeed says she was not part of that effort. But the scores of documents I have got,showing how qazis randomly accept whatever the mans side tells them and make divorce and abandonment of the woman so easy,have prompted me to ensure that Muslim women have access to the same legal safeguards as other women have. The Shariah is to be followed,but not randomly interpreted by qazis,but by courts, she says. The Qazis Act says clearly that they have no judicial powers, she adds.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is treading with caution. Says its spokesman,S Q R Ilyas,The petition is probably seeking to address problems that arise when some qazis behave inappropriately. The board will discuss what can be done. But we do not believe in codification as there is already a Shariah Application Act of 1937,which says that in all personal law matters it is the Shariah that will be applicable to Muslims. We do not want anybody to have the right to amend the Shariah,so we do not believe in codification by Parliament or any other body. Instead,we want a compilation of Islamic law. We brought out a compendium of Islamic law in 2001,which we are translating and which we want judges to consult before pronouncing on matters of personal Islamic law.
The board does not believe in arbitration or witnesses being mandatory for divorce. It is silent on the validity of the triple talaq,a matter that divides the community.
The petition wants this to be struck down as un-Islamic and invalid. But,says senior advocate M R Shamshad; Islamic law sets out preconditions for pronouncing talaq,and these need to be satisfied before the husband finally pronounces talaq."

The CPI(M) leader said the Left Front parties will contest for selected seats in Uttar Pradesh, where the Left movement has had its impact on the public to “defeat communal parties and ensure that the voices of the deprived are raised in the assembly.”
“Our main aim is to prevent communal forces of BJP and its allies from coming to power and work with secular forces wherever the saffron party is strong,” Yechury said.
The Left leader said BJP desperately wanted to win the upcoming state polls, especially for 2019 Lok Sabha polls, for which “new problems have been forced on the common man”, while comparing notebandi (demonetisation) with nasbandi (sterilisation).
Yechury also blamed RSS and BJP for a series of attacks on Left cadres in Kerala.
“RSS and BJP are instigating violence in the name of Hindutva and to expand their base in north Kerala after they won an assembly seat in the state polls last year,” he added."

With this statement, communal elements have got an opportunity for not only making noise but also for unhesitatingly cashing on the surgical strikes.

It should not have got the opportunity that it got due to Rahul Gandhi’s statement.On the one side, the Prime Minister is instructing his party’s leaders and supporters not to make the surgical strikes an issue for celebration.

Roznama Khabrein,in its editorial on October 8, writes: “The government’s ministers ignored the instructions of the PM and kept making provocative statements and the BJP has started using the surgical strikes for its political campaign. The Prime Minister should discourage all such steps that give the feeling that the sacrifices of our army are being used politically. Only then would the country speak in one voice.”
Triple talaq and beyondhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Despite expression of dissatisfaction and even criticism of the affidavit filed by the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board in the Supreme Court on the issue of triple talaq in a section of the Urdu press, there is a sense of unanimity in support of the Board and for not allowing any interference in personal law by the government. Editor of Roznama Khabrein, Qasim Syed in a signed front page commentary on October 9, writes: “Following the country’s independence, the greatest challenge to the protection of the Muslim Personal Law Board is before us. Some weaknesses and shortcomings in the Board’s affidavit can be of benefit to its opponents. Some senior members of the Board and active leaders of different religious organisations had, in a letter to the Board’s president, Maulana Rabey Hasani, expressed their apprehensions on this score. However, this is not the time for an emotional offensive (ishteyaal). It is a time to convert the legal battle into victory by a patient approach. Among other weaknesses, in an effort to justify triple talaq, the traditions of four sects of Muslims have been mentioned in the affidavit, but there is no mention of the Ahl-e-Hadees and Shia sects (which have reservations about triple talaq). Views of all sects should have been included and it could be argued that everyone has the liberty to follow the traditions of their own sect. The question here is not only of the controversy about triple talaq but of protection of Muslim Personal Law which is guaranteed in our Constitution.”
Rashtriya Sahara (October 11) has highlighted the unanimous opinion of some very eminent Ulema and scholars that “All-India Muslim Personal Law Board alone is the representative organisation of Indian Muslims.” Its report has quoted the elucidation of the chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Maulana Jalaluddin Umri, detailing the long process of talaq as prescribed by Islam and the provision of khula for wives too can also ask for talaq if they find it impossible to live with their husbands on account of misbehaviour and ill-treatment. “The country’s Constitution has given every citizen the right to follow his/her religion and disseminate its teachings. This has been considered a fundamental right.It is the belief of Muslims that no change is possible in the principles of the Quran, Hadees (traditions and sayings of the prophet) and the Shariat till the end of the world (qayamat). The Jamaat whole-heartedly supports the stand of the Personal Law Board on these issues, Maulana Umri has stated.
Other eminent Ulema, including Congress MP, Maulana Asrarul Haque Qasmi, and others have expressed the same sentiments about protection of Muslim Personal Law at all cost. Darul Uloom asserts that talaq and polygamy are parts of personal laws and merit protection.
No-booze Bihar
Rashtriya Sahara, in its editorial on October 8, writes: “After the imposition of prohibition, there has been a considerable decline in criminal incidents and road accidents. Cases of domestic violence caused by consumption of alcohol have also recorded a very significant decline.”
Jamaat-e-Islami’s bi-weekly, Daawat, in a front page commentary (October 7), writes: “When Gandhi ji had, during the freedom movement, launched a war against alcohol, his main argument was that this evil destroys the human values of good behaviour. It makes human beings barbarous. But the Judges of Patna High Court had said that ban on consumption of alcohol and strict laws against it were against a ‘civilised society’”."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the use of technologies to ease judicial processes and Chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar spoke about expeditiously dealing with cases related to triple talaq at the valedictory function of the 150th year celebrations of Allahabad High Court on Sunday.
The Prime Minister assured the CJI of complete cooperation from the government to strengthen the judicial system.
Modi said the use of technology would save time and ensure that lawyers made arguments in court with sharpness that would help judges in taking decisions faster. In his speech as the chief guest, Modi said the “janjaal” of laws were created by governments earlier and the common man suffered its burden.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said he was happy that even before completing the term, his government had scrapped around 1,200 laws. Modi stressed on the use of advanced technologies in the judicial system and suggested why dates for cases could not be given on mobile phones and how use of video conferencing for asking questions from a government official would save time if that officer has been transferred to another place.
“Expenditure is made on security as well as while taking prisoners from jails to the courts. Aur us marg mein kya kya nahin hota hai, yeh sab jaante hain.. ab Yogiji ayen hain, toh shayad woh bandh hoga (On this path what all happens everyone knows. Now that Yogji has come, maybe all that will be stopped),” Modi said.
In his speech, CJI Khehar said three Constitution benches had been formed for the coming summer vacation. There were so many serious cases which will make impact on the life of people. One case was of triple talaq, he said. “Do not know what will be the judgment but rights of the people will be defined,” the CJI said about that case.
The CJI further said, as on January 31, 2017, there was pendency of 7 lakh cases in Allahabad HC whereas pendency of 2 lakh cases in its Lucknow bench. The CJI said the Prime Minister speaks his Mann ki Baat and the entire nation listens to him. Today he was there to tell his ‘dil ki baat’ to the PM, he said.
Union Minister for Law & Justice, Electronics and Information technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said the government and judiciary would function in coordination for faster justice delivery. The government was close to finalising the National Litigation Policy and he had written to CMs of all states on the directive of the PM to make efforts that government litigation be reduced to minimum, Prasad added.
The minister further said that digital governance was good governance. There were 2.5 lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) across the country and a paralegal entrepreneur will be trained to be associated with these CSCs so deprived sections could get pre-litigation legal advice. On a pilot basis, it will be started at 200 CSCs each in UP and Bihar, he added."
"1617717140-64","https://indianexpress.com/page/120/?s=Triple+talaq","Where’s her choice?","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/wheres-her-choice/","Where’s her choice?","July 17, 2007 11:53:34 pm","In May 2005, when the Muslim women of the country were looking up to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) to come up with a model nikahnamah — or marriage contract — that purported to reform marriage practices in the community, they were in for a huge let-down. The AIMPLB’s document ensured neither equal rights for women within marriage nor addressed the vexatious problem of adequate maintenance. On the extremely retrograde and tragically prevalent practice of triple talaq it did little, apart from pronouncing in the meekest of tones that it was “avoidable”. The All India Women’s Muslim Personal Law Board had, at that juncture, spoken for many voiceless women within the community when it rejected the entire exercise.  
Given this unfortunate history and the well-known reluctance of the stalwarts who comprise the AIMPLB to alter in the slightest degree the existing gender status quo in the community, the Board’s latest decision to keep Muslim women from taking recourse to secular law should not surprise. But there can still be no getting away from the irony that the Board’s ostensible agenda of “social reform” in the first decade of the 21st century does not include increasing choices for the women of the community. Muslim women may opt to approach the Shariat court or they may not, but the right to choose their legal recourse must be theirs and theirs alone. 
There is another irony that needs to be flagged. If the secular courts of the land can be trusted to dispense justice when it comes to cases involving riots and the like — the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Best Bakery case, for instance, was widely applauded by Muslims — why cannot they be trusted to dispense justice when it comes to matters pertaining to the private sphere? This is a question that the AIMPLB cannot but confront."

Objecting to Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu’s comments that ‘triple talaq’ has no sanction in Shariat, MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday accused BJP leaders of being “selective” in talking about rights of Muslim women. He alleged the BJP was raising the issues like triple talaq with a motive of keeping the “communal pot boiling”.
“Talking about Muslim women’s rights, why Naidu is not speaking about rights of Pehlu Khan’s (who was allegedly lynched by cow vigilantes in Alwar) blind mother?
“Why Naidu is not speaking about rights of Zakia Jafri? (widow of ex-Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots)…So, this selective talking about rights is not acceptable to us,” Owaisi told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Though Prime Minister spoke against politicising (triple Talaq issue), Naidu and a minister in Uttar Pradesh still talked about the matter, he said.
“Basically, BJP wants to keep this communal pot boiling. On 11th of May, supreme court is going to start hearing. So, why is BJP talking before supreme court? If they have (something to say), let them go and speak in the supreme court. But, they want to keep the communal pot boiling,” the Hyderabad MP said.
Naidu yesterday said here that triple talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in Shariat.
“Triple Talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in Shariat. It is a matter of right of equality and right to live with dignity of Muslim women along with other women.
“Why this discrimination…this must be put to an end and it should not be politicised,” the minister said."

(Source: PTI)
Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday questioned BSP supremo Mayawati, Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav and Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi over their “silence” on triple talaq and said it was “not an issue of religion, but of gender justice, gender equality and gender dignity”.
He was in Gandhinagar on Saturday to attend the eighth convocation of Gujarat National Law University (GNLU).
While talking to the media on the sidelines of the event, he said it was unfortunate that Mayawati, Dimple Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi were silent on the issue of triple talaq. “The central government has placed a strong argument against the practice before the Supreme Court, as it is not an issue of religion, but of gender justice, gender equality and gender dignity.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said more than 20 Islamic-majority countries have either limited the practice or abolished it. “Even Hinduism has abolished the wrong practice of untouchability since it is against the Constitution.”
Prasad claimed a large number of Muslim women, affected by the triple talaq, were also among those who voted BJP to power in Uttar Pradesh. “The state has highest number of victims of this practice,” he said.
On building Ram Mandir in Ayodhya following the thumping majority in the UP, Prasad said:“The temple will be constructed legally. We want the apex court to decide on the issue soon.”
On Congress’ performance in the recent Assembly elections, Prasad said that the biggest problem of the grand old party was Rahul Gandhi.
Earlier during the convocation, Prasad, also IT Minister, urged the students to use social media like Facebook and Twitter boldly. “If you tweet on issues you feel strongly about, be bold. That’s the India we want to create where students are forthright.”
The minister added India was at the cusp of a big digital revolution. “Some of the transformative programmes that we have started under the guidance of Prime Minister – Digital India, Make in India, Stand-Up India, Startup India and Skill India – are all designed to empower the country.”
He said that out of a population of 1.25 billion, India is home to 1.8 billion mobile phones, 1.12 billion Aadhaar cards, 50 crore Internet and landline connections and 35 crore smart phones.
Prasad further said that India’s digital economy would become a trillion-dollar economy in the coming years, which would create new avenues for legal redressal. “Communication, IT services, digital delivery, e-commerce, cyber security, digital payment, are going to create new avenues for legal redressal,” said Prasad.
As many as 221 PhD scholars, postgraduates and graduates among other students received their degrees. Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh of Supreme Court, Gujarat HC Chief Justice R Subhash Reddy and Gujarat minister Pradipsinh Jadeja were also present at the convocation."

Had Akhilesh Yadav become the UP chief minister again, the Samajwadi Party’s reins could have been given back to Mulayam, but since the party lost the state polls, the former would remain the party president, its leader Ram Gobind Chaudhary on Sunday.
In a bitter power struggle within the SP, Akhilesh was anointed the party president at its national convention on January 1, upstaging his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. Akhilesh had reportedly said, “I have asked him (Mulayam) to give me authority for three months. After returning to power, he may decide whatever he wants.”
Chaudhary today said, “Had the Samajwadi Party got majority in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, then Akhilesh Yadav would have become the chief minister, while handing over the reins of the party to Mulayam.” “However, the SP lost the Assembly election. Hence, there is no need to hand over the national president post to Mulayam Singh Yadav,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the Samajwadi Party’s drubbing in the Assembly polls, voices of handing over the party’s reins to Mulayam has started gaining momentum. Senior leader Shivpal Yadav has said Akhilesh should handover the reins of the party back to his father. “He (Akhilesh Yadav) should unite the family and the party by fulfilling his promise. He should show some morality. He should follow what he had said before the election and should make Netaji (Mulayam) the national president of the party,” Shivpal had said in Mainpuri on April 18. On triple talaq, Chaudhary termed the issue as “irrelevant” and asked, “Why does the BJP not raise issues concerning Hindu women?”
Accusing the BJP of indulging in fake ‘Gau Seva’ he said, “The BJP leaders only offer green fodder to the cows, while the actual fodder of cows is hay.” Reacting to Chaudhary’s comments, state BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said who becomes the president of SP is its “internal matter”.
“It is not Samajwadi Party, it is Pariwaarwadi Party. Akhilesh has failed as the party president and it is quite possible that the SP workers want a person to be the party’s chief under whom they could have won the election,” he said. The Samajwadi Party, which had fought the Uttar Pradesh election in alliance with the Congress, had managed to win only 47 of the 403 seats in the Assembly. The Congress won in only 7 Assembly constituencies.
On triple talaq issue, Tripathi asked, “If the Samajwadi Party was really concerned about the Muslims, then why did it choose to overlook the plight of Muslim women.”"

(File Photo)
Amid the ongoing debate over ‘Triple Talaq’, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said the government is of the clear view that personal laws should be constitutionally compliant and in conformity with norms of gender equality and the right to live with dignity. In a Facebook post titled “Triple Talaq and the Government’s Affidavit”, he said that governments in the past have shied from taking a categorical stand that personal laws must comply with Fundamental Rights but the present one has taken a clear position on the issue.

“Personal laws have to be constitutionally compliant and the institution of Triple Talaq, therefore, will have to be judged on the yardstick of equality and the Right to Live with Dignity. Needless to say that the same yardstick would be applicable to all other personal laws,” he said.
Observing that the constitutional validity of ‘Triple Talaq’ is distinct from the Uniform Civil Code, he said as of today, the issue before the Supreme Court is only with regard to the constitutional validity of Triple Talaq.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
	
	
		
			
In its affidavit in Supreme Court on October 7, the Law Ministry argued that polygamy and Triple Talaq should be done away with, and said that such practices “cannot be regarded as essential or integral part of the religion”.
“The academic debate with regard to the Uniform Civil Code can go on before the Law Commission. The question to be answered is that assuming that each community has its separate personal law, should not those personal laws be constitutionally compliant?” Jaitley said.
He said there is a fundamental distinction between religious practices, rituals and civil rights.
“Religious functions associated with birth, adoption, succession, marriage, death, can all be conducted through rituals and customs as per existing religious practices.
“Should rights emanating from birth, adoption, succession, marriage, divorce etc. be guided by religion or by constitutional guarantees? Can there be inequality or compromise with human dignity in any of these matters?” Jaitley said.
Some people may hold a conservative, if not obsolete, view that personal laws need not be constitutionally compliant, he said, adding “the Government’s view is clear. Personal laws have to be constitutionally compliant…”."

Muslims of the country will not tolerate an “interference” with their personal law and give a “suitable” reply to the BJP in the coming Assembly elections on the ‘triple talaq’ issue, the leaders of All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam (AITUI) said on Tuesday. “The (Narendra) Modi government is trying to push the country towards the RSS agenda. Sunni Muslims oppose the Law Commission’s move to seek public opinion on abolishing triple talaq,” said president of AITUI Mufti Ashfaq Hussain Qadri, adding that the minority community will give a “suitable” reply to the saffron party in the upcoming Assembly polls in a few states.

The body of Sunni Muslim scholars will take out a ‘Parliament March’ from Jantar Mantar on November 18 to express its opposition to the Centre and Uniform Civil Code (UCC), he told a press conference.
“Thousands of Muslims will gather at Jantar Mantar on November 18 and march towards Parliament in protest against the attempts of the Modi government to impose UCC. They oppose the proposals of the government to bring changes in the Shariat in the name of women’s safety,” said Qadri.
The issues of missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed and rights of Palestinians will also be included in the agenda, said Shujat Qadri, general secretary of the Muslim Students’ Organisation of India."

Even as the last day of JD(U)’s two-day national council meet saw most leaders projecting Bihar CM Nitish Kumar as “future PM”, Nitish made no direct mention of his desire for the top post, but said that he would spare time from his current duties to work in other states.
“Gadhe ke upar jo bhi bhaar laad diya jaata hai wah usko dho leta hai — chhe man laad dijiye ta aath man. Mai to mehnat karne wala aadmi hoon, din bhar me 15 ghante kaam karta hoon. Jis din kaam nahi rehta hai us din achccha nahi lagta hai (A donkey carries whatever load it is given to carry. I am used to working hard and can work for 15 hours a day. On days that I do not have much work, I do not feel good),” said Nitish in his 85-minute speech.
Interestingly, senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav was the only one who did not make any mention of Nitish Kumar’s leadership and his national role. He instead exhorted party workers to make party so strong that it can wrest power in Delhi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This was also the first time JD(U)’s top leaders spoke with clarity on Nitish’s national role. The presence of former Jharkhand CM Babulal Marandi as chief guest at the event outlined JD(U)’s attempt to emerge as the main force behind creating a non-NDA front with Nitish at its centre.
Party spokesperson KC Tyagi said Nitish Kumar had “delivered for Bihar and now the country is looking up to him amid vitiated social atmosphere”.
In his speech, Nitish endorsed the Centre’s stand on terrorism, but said: “PM must ensure that no political party should try to take mileage out of it and advertise it. I had congratulated Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on success of military operation (surgical attack) and our party has passed a resolution on being with Centre on its stand on terrorism.”
Apart from his government’s “success stories” in Bihar, Nitish touched on issues dominating the political discourse in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. About JD(U)’s stand on triple talaq, he said: “Our stand on such issues is well know since we had become part of NDA in 1996. Let Muslims decide. Let Centre not impose it, Muslims should take a decision keeping in mind progress of their womenfolk.”
Targeting BJP for raising emotive issues before every election, the Bihar CM said: “Creating religious frenzy can give them some temporary gain, but ultimately there is no gain.”"

After stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but acting on them, BSP president Mayawati on Saturday vowed to waive farmers’ loans up to Rs 1 lakh per head and extend quota benefits to the poor among the upper castes.

“The reservation facility to Dalits and backwards will come to an end in case BJP, which is working on RSS agenda, comes to power in UP….With BSP in power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition,” she told a public meeting here.
“When voted to power, BSP government will waive loans up to Rs 1 lakh to poor farmers,” she said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Addressing a press conference on her birthday last month, Mayawati had stated that unlike other parties offering allurements in manifesto which they do not keep, BSP does not believe in having such a pledge document as it wants to work instead of making tall promises.
Alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped his confidants adjust their black money in 10 months prior to note ban, Mayawati said BJP has realised the extent of anger among people on the issue and that is why no one has been projected as its chief ministerial candidate.
She accused the SP government of indulging in politics of vendetta and said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail. She promised that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed.
Mayawati said that after the Yadav family feud, minorities have become totally disenchanted with SP and feared that the SP-Congress alliance would indirectly help BJP.
“Mulayam Singh humiliated his brother Shivpal due to his love for his son Akhilesh, now Shivpal’s supporters will not sit silently…SP is divided into two parts…if minorities do not sit up they will have to face problems,” she said.
Cautioning minorities against BJP, Mayawati said Modi government is looking at them with doubt and they are being meted step-motherly treatment in the country.
“Modi government is interfering in common civil code, triple talaq…minorities are being troubled in the name of gauraksha, love jehad and terrorism,” she added."

There should be an internal mechanism to curb triple talaq, like naming and shaming the man who arbitrarily divorces his wife, Muslim scholars have said, emphasising that the government must stay out of the community’s personal laws.
Watch What Else is Making News


They termed the government’s raking up the issue at this time as an election gimmick, and pointed out that there were several misconceptions about triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Notwithstanding their dogmatic differences, the Muslim scholars IANS spoke to — from Hanafis to Ahle Hadith and from Deobandis to Barelvis and even Shias — categorically decried any interference by the government in matters “which are purely religious”, calling any such attempt “unconstitutional”.
However, they agreed that there must be a mechanism to protect women against the arbitrary behaviour of men who are prone to pronounce talaq “without valid reasons”.
“Such men must be punished, and the community should evolve a mechanism, including boycotting them socially. Nobody should get his daughter married to that man ever again,” Maulana Abdul Hameed Naumani of the Jamiat Ulema Hind, told IANS.
He said that although triple talaq, or pronouncing the equivalent of “I divorce thee” thrice in one sitting, is haraam (prohibited and sinful) the divorce is anyway effected.
According to Muslim Personal Law, if a husband utters only two talaqs, his wife can continue to stay with him, but after the third talaq the divorce comes into effect immediately. The husband can neither stay with his wife nor remarry her until the nikah-e-halala is done.
A nikah-e-halala is one where the woman is required to marry another man (as and when that happens) and if the second husband divorces her willingly (not under coercion or as an understanding) after consummation of marriage, only then can the first husband remarry the woman.
“This condition was set as a punishment for those men who would pronounce talaq arbitrarily,” Naumani explained.
A Barelvi cleric, Maulana Ansar Raza, too, agreed there should be some checks against men divorcing their wives without legitimate reasons. “But triple talaq cannot be wished away. You cannot alter the law of Allah,” he added.
Milli Council General Secretary Manzoor Alam, however, spoke in favour of triple talaq. “What if a man finds his wife in a compromising position with another man, or gets evidence of her extramarital affair? Generally, a person would be enraged in such a situation and may take the extreme step. So, instead of killing the woman or killing oneself, there is the easy way out of marriage through triple talaq,” Alam argued.
Kamal Farooqui, a vocal Muslim and member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said that he is not surprised at the Narendra Modi government trying to politicise the issue of talaq in the garb of social reform.
“It is part of their communal agenda. They are trying to create all sorts of misconceptions,” Farooqui said, adding that divorce is a most unpleasant word for Allah.
He suggested that to curb triple talaq, conditions can be set in the nikahnama, or the contract of nikah. “In Islam, marriage is a social contract. The woman and her guardians have every right and liberty to set the conditions of the nikah as per their convenience,” he said.
Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq echoed Farooqui’s stand. “In Shia jurisprudence, there is no concept of triple talaq. But in sections of Muslim society where this practice is prevalent, the ulema should sit together and decide what they can do to curb it,” Kalbe Sadiq said.
However, he added, there is “no scope for the government’s interference” in the matter.
Ahle Hadith cleric Maulana Asghar Ali Salafi, too, agreed with Kalbe Sadiq. “There is no concept of triple talaq in our jurisprudence. But those practising it are doing so according to their belief system and their interpretation of the Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence).
“Nobody, including the government, has any business interfering with it, most certainly not for votes,” Salafi said.
Muslim scholars also rejected the contention that triple talaq be banned as it is in several Muslim countries.
“Suppose it is banned in 22 countries. But there are 52 Muslim countries, which means it is still in practice in the majority of Muslim countries,” said Manzoor Alam.
“We live in India, not in Saudi or Pakistan. We are bound by Indian laws, not of any other country, and the Constitution of India guarantees us freedom to profess and practise our religion,” Raza said."

(Illustration by: C R Sasikumar)
I am deeply pained to read that the courts have had to interfere in interpreting to the world the true spirit of my religion, Islam. The judgment of the Bombay High Court upholding Muslim women’s right to enter the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai is a slap in the face of us Muslims for not having spoken up for a religion which has stood for the rights of women since the day it was revealed 1,400 years ago. And accolades to the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) for speaking up.
During the life of the Prophet, women freely entered the first mosque of Islam in Medina. They not only entered but asked the Prophet questions to clear their doubts about the revelations. The Hadith about the Prophet’s wife Umm Salama is well-known. She asked him, “O Prophet of Allah, why is it that all revelations of the Quran are concerned with men? What about us women?” It was then that surah 4 of the Quran was revealed which is called Surah Al Nisa, meaning “The Women”. This Hadith proves two points. One, women had the freedom to enter the mosque and hold discussions with the Prophet. Two, their legitimate concern merited an entire surah which is the second longest surah as well as the most comprehensive explication of women’s rights enshrined in any scripture of the world.
Instead of propagating to the world the content of this surah, we Muslims are hell bent on projecting Islam in the exact opposite light. Will we ever realise the harm we are doing to Islam by constantly falling in the trap of our own making? Sadly, we cannot see beyond the patriarchal construct in which we are conditioned. In denying rights to Muslim women, the male ego may exult for a while but it kills the spirit of Islam. Gender in Islam becomes reduced to debates about dargah entrance and burkinis. In these worst of times, when our one-point agenda should be to show Islam’s gendered face to the world, we are hopelessly entangled in the most inconsequential matters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Masjid-e-Nabavi in Medina was built by the Prophet as a humble mud structure for the first Muslims. It was here that the great Ethiopian slave Bilal-e-Habsh stood to call the first azan. Today it is ostentatious, glittering and resplendent, because it houses the mausoleum of the Prophet. Whereas in his lifetime women came to him freely, today they are kept as far as possible from his mortal remains. This was my experience when I went to recite the fatiha at his grave. My point here is the same: The intent of Islam and the Prophet to give equal access to women has been reversed by us, everywhere.
The same reversal can be seen in other matters related to women. Take two of the most notorious tenets attributed to Islam; polygamy and triple talaq. Islam is globally condemned for “permitting” up to four marriages and “permitting” arbitrary talaq. The reason for the universal condemnation is the popular understanding that Islam “allows” these terribly anti-women practices. The fact that there are more multiple marriages in other religions than in Islam is negated by the fallacy that Islam casually permits them. It is this grave aspersion on Islam that we need to fight and prove wrong rather than quibbling over settled practices such as dargah entry.
The simple fact about polygamy or “up to four marriages” is the giant step Islam took to correct the pre-Islamic practice of contracting scores and scores of marriages and treating women as chattel and spoils of war. It drastically reduced the number to four but placed upon it a condition that was humanly impossible to fulfill. “If you can give all wives exact equal treatment” was the strict injunction. The next few words slice it to one. The Quran states that human nature is such that equal treatment is impossible, therefore, best to stay with one, and one only. This restriction imposed 1,400 years ago, in essence, prohibits multiple marriage and points towards monogamy. But we not only refused to move forward, we actually slid back.
The same holds for triple talaq. There is nothing more repugnant to Islam than arbitrary talaq and yet the practice not only continues but is also condoned by some. Islamic marriage is a legal contract between two people which is duly witnessed and sealed as a legal document. In the same manner, talaq is a legal process, a way to get out of a bad marriage, with the maximum advantage to the woman. The manner of talaq is detailed in the Quran. It calls for thoughtful, well-considered action, with prescribed intervals for review and change of mind. At the same time it ensures that the woman is well-looked after as the first charge on the husband’s income. The word in the Quran is that even if he has given her a “qintaar” of gold, the husband should not ask for its return. The Quran has many directions for the husband which when aggregated reflect its deep caring for women. These are the aspects of Islam that we should take to the world, change its view, and align it with the teachings of the Quran.
Then there is the beauty of Islam which allows a million flowers to bloom. Each according to his or her own light is what the Quran states. It says that Allah is closer to you than your jugular vein. So I can see it my way, you can see it in yours; there is no compulsion in religion, Lakum dinakum walia din. There are five major schools of Islamic jurisprudence and scores of other smaller fiqahs people follow according to their will. There is no homogenous Islam. One fiqah may have more adherents but that does not mean that other fiqahs are “less” equal. In the matter of triple talaq, for instance, there is clear rejection of it in the Shia school and Ahl e Hadith. Freedom of choice is available to all believers.
In the Bombay HC judgment, the BMMA has scored a victory. They have brought the practice closer to the spirit. My pain is that the court was constrained to quote the constitution and law to allow dargah entrance when Islam opens all places of worship and faith not only to women but to people of all faiths. The worst thing the dargah trust can do now, in my view, is to appeal against this judgment.
There is a lesson here for all of us, especially for those who profess to “speak for the Muslim quom”. By their recalcitrant attitude, aren’t they doing a great disservice to our great religion? As Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, whose Tajumanul Quran is the world’s best translation and explication, said in his Al Hilal article: “All the miseries of the Muslims are due to the fact that they have turned from this divine source of guidance, and they thought they needed to look upon it only in regard to religious rituals, like roza and namaz. They did not realise its importance in all aspects, educational, cultural and political.”
Wisdom flows from the words of the reformist poet-philosopher Maulana Altaf Husain Hali who wrote in 1879 in his 320 canto epic poem, Musaddas e Hali: Until when will they last, your atrophied days/ Until when will new generations be crushed/ Until when will persist your profligate ways/ Until when will you blindly just follow the herd?/ Forget the old fable, the tale and the story/ Fight scourge of bigotry, it’s evil, it’s fury."

Keeping in view the debate on uniform civil code, the law body had sought public opinion on the revision of family laws to avoid social injustice.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Law Commission on Friday had issued an appeal, saying that the objective behind the same was to address “discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices,” assuring that “norms of no one class, group or community will dominate the tone and tenor of family law reform”.
“The Commission hopes to begin a healthy conversation about the viability of a uniform civil code and will focus on family laws of all religions and the diversity of customary practices, to address social injustice rather than plurality of laws,” law panel chairman Justice B S Chauhan (retd) had said on Friday.

The petitioner Noor Jahan had sought an order from the Supreme Court stating that Section 2 of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution. In her petition, Jahan has questioned whether an unilateral and arbitrary divorce through triple talaq should deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have the custody of her children."

The women’s wing of All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Saturday claimed the rate of divorce among Muslims was low as compared to other communities and that the issue of triple talaq was being projected in wrong light. Sharing data collected from family courts in certain Muslim concentrated districts across the country, the wing’s chief organiser Asma Zohra said the women are well protected under Islam which is reflected from the low percentage of Muslim women seeking divorce.
The remarks come in the backdrop of a debate on triple talaq. The matter is also before the Supreme Court which will go into the legal aspects of the practice.
She said the exercise to collect data from family courts was started in May last year under which statistics were sought through RTI from family courts in Muslim concentrated districts for five years from 2011-2015.
Sixteen family courts gave detailed consolidated reports.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We have compiled the report which shows that the divorce rate is minimal in the Muslim community. Similarly, we collected details from various Darul Qaza which also indicate that only 2-3 per cent cases are related to divorce out of which most were initiated by women only,” Zohra told a press conference here.
Darul Qaza is an Islamic Shariyat court.
As per the report prepared by Muslim Mahila Research Kendra in coordination with Shariah Committee for Women, the number of cases of divorce for Muslims stood at 1,307 against Hindu at 16,505. The cases of divorce for Christians in these districts stood at 4,827 and 8 for Sikhs.
These figures were from the eight districts of Kannur (Kerala), Nasik (Maharashtra), Karimnagar (Telangana), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Secunderabad (Hyderabad), Malappuram (Kerala), Ernakulam (Kerala) and Palakkad (Kerala).
She said the work on compilation of the statistics is going on.
“The issue of triple talaq cropped up in recent years and was politicised. The issue needs to be understood in the right manner and perspective. Islam has given certain liberties to women and they are well protected in the community,” she said.
She said there were other burning issues affecting women across communities like dowry, domestic violence, child marriage, female foeticide. She added that these issues need to be addressed prominently, instead of only pointing towards the Muslim community.
On the issue of working Muslim women, she said their safety and security should be considered first and foremost.
Zohra is in the city to attend a two-day workshop on the rights and challenges of Muslim women which began here today.
On the first day of the workshop, sessions on Marriage and Divorce in Islam, rights of women in Quran and the Constitutional and role of All India Muslim Personal Law Board were held.
A public meeting expected to be attended by nearly 30,000 women will be held tomorrow, Yasmeen Farooqui, convener of the Rajasthan women’s wing and member of the AIMPLB said.
The Centre had before the apex court opposed the practice of triple talaq on grounds of gender equality and secularism. The AIMPLB had told the apex court that the pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.
The Board had also said that the validity of Mohammedan Law, founded essentially on the Holy Quran and sources based on it, cannot be tested on the particular provisions of the Constitution."

Observations by the Allahabad High Court on triple talaq last week underlined concern over the plight of Muslim women in the matter of marital rights. Government figures show Muslim women between the ages of 20 and 34 are more likely to be divorced than women of any other community in the same age group. The figures, however, show other trends that caution against drawing generalised conclusions.
Census figures from 2001 and 2011 show the percentage of Muslim women aged 20-39 who were never married nearly doubled over the decade — the percentage increase of 94% was significantly higher than among Buddhist (72.78%), Hindu (69.13%) and Sikh (66.21%) women.

Nearly 33.70 lakh Muslim women — 12.87% of 2.1 crore Muslim women aged 20-39 — were unmarried in 2011, figures show.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
During the same decade (2001 to 2011), the percentage of Muslim women in this age group without children increased by 39%, a rate of increase that was second only to Buddhist women (45%). The number of Hindu women in this same group increased by 29.5% between the two Censuses.
The 2011 Census recorded the number of married women between the ages 20 and 39 who did not have children at 2.73 crore. This was an increase of 31% from the 2.08 crore women in this group in the 2001 Census.
Activists claim better conditions in urban areas have allowed younger Muslim women greater choice in leading their lives.
“Improving socioeconomic conditions within the community have played a role in helping women become more assertive. Women to a certain degree have greater control over their lives than they did earlier,” Noor Jehan Safia Niiaz, convener of the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said.
“The trend may not be so obvious in rural areas but urban Muslims, as they become empowered, are taking time to plan their families. The increasing numbers of Muslim girls who are stepping out to work has also played a role in this,” Rubina Feroz, general secretary of Ishterak Education Society and member of the Association of Muslim Professionals, said."

PTI
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stressed the use of technology to ease judicial processes while Chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar spoke about expeditiously dealing with cases related to triple talaq. They were speaking at the valedictory function of the 150th year celebrations of Allahabad High Court. The PM assured the CJI of complete cooperation from the government to strengthen the judicial system. Modi said the use of technology would save time and ensure that lawyers make sharp arguments in court that would help judges in taking decisions faster.
In his speech as the chief guest, Modi said a “janjaal” of laws was created by earlier governments and the common man suffered its burden. He said he was happy that his government had scrapped around 1,200 laws.
Modi stressed the use of advanced technologies in the judicial system and suggested that dates for cases be given on mobile phones. He also suggested connecting jails with courts through video-conferencing to save time and money spent on movement of prisoners.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Expenditure is made on security as well as while taking prisoners from jails to the courts. Aur us marg mein kya kya nahin hota hai, yeh sab jaante hain.. ab Yogiji (Adityanath) ayen hain, toh shayad woh bandh hoga (Everyone knows what happens on this path. Now that Yogji has come, maybe all that will be stopped),” Modi said.
In his speech as special guest, CJI Khehar said three Constitution benches had been formed for the coming summer vacation. There were many serious cases that would make an impact on the life of people, he said, one of which was triple tala. “Do not know what will be the judgment but the rights of the people will be defined,” the CJI said about that case and told about another case of citizenship in Assam by saying that there are lakhs of Bangladeshis who do not know whether they were Indians or not. They will come to know about their rights, he added.
The CJI further said that as on January 31, 2017, there was pendency of 7 lakh cases in the Allahabad High Court and pendency of 2 lakh cases in its Lucknow bench. The CJI said the PM speaks his Mann ki Baat and the entire nation listens to him. Today he was there to tell his ‘dil ki baat’ to the PM, he said. Khehar said after becoming the CJI, he found a marathon of arrears. “No one is going to come from abroad and settle our cases. We have to do it ourselves,” the CJI said.
Union Minister for Law & Justice, Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government and judiciary would function in coordination for faster justice delivery."

The Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), a group affiliated to the RSS, has announced a nationwide campaign to attract Muslim women voters by raising the issue of triple talaq. It will also implore its supporters to vote keeping the nation in mind and not caste or religion. MRM is going to hold ‘Jalsas’ in different districts of UP to speak to Muslim women and seek their support over the issue. RSS national executive member and MRM ‘margdarshak’ Indresh Kumar and MRM national convener Mohd Afzal will address these Jalsas.

“Two Jalsas are being started from UP and Muslim women will be told there that the triple talaq was not exercised during the period of Hazrat Mohammad because Hazarat Mohammad was against it,” said Afzal. He added that the group will spread awareness among Muslims that talaq should be done as per Quran only.
“Our objective is not political but we will appeal the Muslims to vote in the name of nation (in the upcoming election) instead of caste and religion. We will make them aware that some political leaders are misleading Muslims,” said Mahirajdhwaj Singh, MRM national co-convener. He said that Muslim voters would be asked to compare the performance of the previous governments and that of the Centre. All communities benefitted from the NDA rule, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But triple talaq will be the main issue in these meetings. “We will tell them of the Supreme Court’s observations on the issue and how Muslim women had approached it. The Centre had no role behind this move,” said Singh.
Singh said that women wing of MRM has been engaged to contact the women of the community and invite them in Jalsa. Afzal said that MRM has also formed a ‘Zakat fund’ for helping the divorcee women and will arrange free education too for their children."

Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “justice for Muslim women” remark, the CPI on Monday asked him to be equally concerned about similar problem of Hindu and Christian women to ensure gender equality. Modi had yesterday made a strong pitch against the issue of ‘triple talaq’, insisting exploitation of Muslim women should end and justice be done to them.
The CPI contended that all personal laws are “biased” against women and suggested Modi to not keep himself “confined” to the issue of ‘triple talaq’ only. “Modi should speak in a larger context. Not only Muslim sisters, several Hindu sisters, Christian sisters too are being exploited as all personal laws are biased against women.
“The question is to strive for gender equality and gender justice,” CPI national secretary D Raja said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Raja further charged the Prime Minister with speaking on triple talaq but remaining silent on the women reservation bill.
Addressing BJP’s national executive at Bhubaneshwar yesterday, Modi had also deprecated any attempt at creating “conflict” within the Muslim community on the issue and suggested tackling it through social awareness."

The Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Friday said that lack of “spirituality” was one of the reasons that leads to farmer suicides. He was speaking to reporters at a program here. To a question about farmer suicides in Maharashtra and elsewhere, the spiritual leader said, “We have done pad-yatra in 512 villages of Vidarbha, and on that basis we can say that poverty alone is not the reason behind the farmer suicides. They lack spirituality.
“Therefore, I appeal to all the people who work in this field (of spirituality) to reach out to farmers,” he said.
Yoga and pranayam were essential to “remove suicidal tendencies” among the farmers, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about the controversy over the cultural event organised by Art of Living Foundation on the banks of Yamuna which is alleged to have damaged the river’s floodplains, Ravi Shankar said, “The truth will triumph.”
“I have full faith in the judicial system….There is an NGO which is carrying on malicious campaign…There is some disadvantage of being popular,” he said.
“But we have not done anything wrong. Our panel of 15 independent scientists have established fair report and we have always been and would be extra-sensitive towards the environment,” he said.
His organisation had removed “500 tonnes of garbage” from Yamuna, he claimed.
“I fail to understand why there is so much fuss about that historic festival with which 1.8 billion, that is one third of the globe’s population, connected, and (where) 2,500 religious leaders came on one platform. Let the people opposing it tell us what wrong we committed,” he said.
To a question about Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam’s tweets about loudspeakers on mosques, Ravi Shankar said, “Religious places do not need loudspeakers. Prayers coming from heart directly reach the Gods.”
Asked about his views on triple talaq, Ravi Shankar said, “Every religion goes through reforms at a certain period. I don’t say that triple talaq should be banned immediately, but certainly their (Muslim community’s) leaders must find a solution that will protect everyone’s human and societal rights.”"

Express
When it comes to Islam and Muslim women, the field has become increasingly crowded. Doctrines of patriarchy have always existed and these principles were dominated by the power play within the community. The challenge often lay in examining the implications of a misogynistic belief system within the Muslim community. But now, another challenge that needs to be addressed is examining the implications of actors entering the stage to speak on Islam, and often on behalf of Islam.
Watch What Else Is Making News

It is a widely held belief that Muslim women have been subjugated in Muslim society. The notion of identity is analysed along the lines of being conservative and without having any choices. While one is aware of the patriarchal and cultural set-up within the community, it is also a fact that “Islamic feminism” is emerging as an ideology amongst Muslim women across the globe, including in India. There are women, who, while holding on to their religious beliefs, are resisting, fighting back and speaking up for their rights.
What is interesting is that while Muslim women are coming forth and enforcing ideas of agency and freedom, they are caught between the loud spokespersons of their own community at one end, and those speaking on their behalf for them, at the other. In India, there has been an ongoing debate about triple talaq (divorce by repudiation) and the need for its abolition. The petition signed by Indian Muslim women, challenging the validity of this method to end a marriage has opened up conversations once again on reforms based on gender equality and justice. However, voices within the Muslim community seem to be divided on this, with some calling the abolition of triple talaq “un-Islamic”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
If the fights within the community were not enough, the Modi government has taken things one step further and introduced the idea having a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). This law would be based on the principles of secularism, as suggested by the government, putting all Indian citizens under the same law, irrespective of their religious affiliations.
While the idea of a Uniform Civil Code in the country on paper sounds like it balances the gender injustices that women have faced, this law, without any draft and with unclear terms, still raises important questions on what precisely those ideas of justice and gender equality would be — in this particular case, for Muslim women.
At a recent rally in Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke specifically about the “rights of Muslim sisters”, and broke his silence on the issue of triple talaq. “Shouldn’t Muslim mothers and sisters be protected? Shouldn’t Muslim sisters get equal rights? Some Muslim sisters fought for their rights in court. The Supreme Court asked us, what is the stand of the Government of India? We replied in very clear terms that no injustice should be done to mothers and sisters, that no discrimination should take place in the name of religion,” Modi said.
It is indeed important to address and also apply such feminist ideals and campaigns against patriarchal set-ups within the Muslim community, or any other religious community for that matter. However, there is a difference between “rights” and “laws”.
In France, a similar dialogue on the basis of “secularism” has questioned the “right” of a Muslim woman to wear what she wants to wear — which includes a hijab or a Burkini. French officials have championed the law as a protection of the country’s “secular constitution” and a defence against the regressive Islamic attitude towards its women. The question is: Is this constitutional secularism pitted against freedom of religion? Why does it not include “rights of all its citizens”, which includes the right to wear what one wants to wear? There seems to be a trend of selectively targeting a minority community and justifying it as an attack on a feudal-religious order. It is important not just to address these issues, but also challenge the intention behind going after a minority community.
Given the current status of India, it would be more meaningful to have uniformity of “rights”, given to all its citizens, which would also include protection of women’s rights, gender justice and most importantly, education, culture and religious freedoms of its citizens. But as of now, citizens are only being told of a uniformity of law based on certain vague ideas of “secularism”. It is important to know what those ideas will be, how they could affect individual lives in the country and whether they will be at the cost of national integration."

BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday hit out at the opposition for opposing demonetisation and accused them of stalling all business in the winter session of Parliament just to sidestep discussion on funding of political parties.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured discussion and change in fund raising process of political parties during the all-party meeting at the beginning of winter session and said all elections from Panchayat to Parliament should be held on the same day,” Shah said.
“But the opposition did not allow a discussion in the entire winter session. They do not have any intention of wiping out blackmoney from politics. Modiji has put forward a view, and I want to appeal to leaders of all opposition parties that and we should accept discussion on it to bring probity in politics,” he said at his party’s Parivartan rally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Continuing his attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said only those whose “billions have been reduced to trash” are feeling the pain after the measure. “Have you seen the faces of Mamata (Banerjee) and Mayawati…their faces have lost glow, they have started looking 10 years older in a day’, he said.
In one stroke by PM Modi, drug dealers, fake currency racketeers, Naxalites and terrorists have been set right, Shah said.

Stressing that development of UP is possible only when BJP is voted to power with a two-thirds majority, Shah termed SP and BSP as family and caste-based parties which cannot work for development of the entire society. “It has been either ‘chacha-bhatija’ or ‘bua-bhatija’ who have been harming the state’s development in the past 15 years,” he said, referring to UP SP chief Shivpal Yadav, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati.
Akhilesh was not allowing the benefits of the central schemes to reach the people as it would increase the popularity of central government, Shah claimed. “The benefits of Fasal Bima Yojana could not reach the beneficiaries as there was a tiff for commission between the chahcha and bhatija,” he claimed.
Shah said the UP Chief Minister has been talking of an alliance with Congress as it seems he has now realised that defeat is staring him in the face. “Since the past one month Akhilesh Yadav has been talking about alliance. Is he seeing defeat for his party? Even if all the parties come together the people of UP have decided to vote BJP to power in the state,” he said.
Shah was also particularly critical of Mayawati for her alleged corruption. “Though there is no record set for corruption in the world but if such a record is made Behenji’s number will come out top in it,” he said.
Referring to the issue of ‘triple talaq’, Shah said after the central government clearly stated its views in the Supreme Court against it, the SP, BSP and Congress have all gone silent. “Na haan kehte kain na naa.”
He also appealed to women voters to question those parties on what they are doing for women’s rights and whether they agree on triple talaq or not when they come seeking votes. “Should Muslim women get their rights or not? Modi has worked towards securing the rights of women in the country”, he asserted."

Amid a raging debate over instantaneous triple talaq, the RSS’s women wing says that the solution to the issue should come from within the Muslim community. Seetha Annadanam, All India General Secretary of Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, said, “All women should have uniform justice and there should be no discrimination in that.
“We have also passed a proposal on the issue of triple talaq in the past. From the point of view of safety of women and what is currently going on in the community, this must happen. The problem has risen from the community so the answer will also come from within.”
To a question on whether there should be a codified muslim personal law, she said, “That is something the Muslim community has to think about. The question has risen from there and the answer too will come from there. As a woman I will say there should be justice for everyone. But we can’t interfere in there personal laws and with Quran.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rashtra Sevika Samiti is organising a three-day conclave from November 11 for its volunteers. The theme of the programme is the role of the family in nation building and cultural preservation through family. Nearly 2,500 participants are expected at the event.
The event will be inaugurated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and Goa Governor Mridula Sinha will also be attending it. Paralympic silver medalist Deepa Malik will be felicitated at a valedictory function."

The All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board and various other outfits on Thursday opposed the Law Commission’s questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code and announced their boycott of the move, accusing the government of waging a “war” against the community. Addressing a press conference here, they contended that Uniform Civil Code (UCC), if implemented, will paint all people in “one colour” which will threaten the country’s pluralism and diversity.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Trashing government’s stand on the issue of triple talaq, the outfits instead claimed the community has reported lesser number of divorce cases vis-à-vis other communities, especially the Hindu community which, they said, has reported higher divorce ratio according to Census 2011.
AIMPLB general secretary Wali Rehmani, Jamiat-Ulema -e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani and representatives of other bodies said all the Muslim sects and its women were “one” on these issues.
They said the outfits will launch a campaign to create awareness amongst Muslims from Friday, beginning with a gathering in Lucknow.
The Board said that there are “flaws” in the personal laws governing Muslims and they are being addressed from time-to-time.

They said the country is facing problems on various fronts including the LoC and issues like killings elsewhere.
“This is all destructive. The government should try to fix this and ensure peace than seeking views on issues like UCC,” Madani said.
Contrary to the Commission’s claim that the step is an “endeavour” to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices, Rehmani said when implemented the UCC will bring to an end country’s pluralism and paint all in “one colour” and end diversity and pluralism.
“People of different cultures stay in this country. If the UCC is implemented, attempts will be made to paint all in one colour, which is not in the interest of the country.
“Also, we don’t want the practice of triple talaq to be abolished. There are more divorces in other communities. Rather the highest rate, which is double that of Muslims, is among Hindus,” he claimed.
When pointed that some Muslim community members have raised the issue of triple talaq, Rehmani curtly said that “they have all the right to do so in a democracy”.
Madani termed as a “trap” the Commission’s claim that the move is an attempt to address discrimination.
“The government is trying to divert attention of people from its failure. We hope it withdraws the move. If it doesn’t, we will decide on our future course of action. At present, we are trying to create awareness among Muslims inm the country,” he added.
Meanwhile, women members of the Board stressed that contrary to perception, the personal law balances rights of Muslim women and men “very well” and that there is no need for reforms in it.
“There is no need for any reform in the law. Triple talaq is not an issue and the government’s move to impose UCC intends to snatch our religious freedom guaranteed in the Indian Constitution. That’s the reason we are fighting for our rights,” Aasma Zehra, a Board member, said.
Making perhaps the first such move, the Law Commission had on October 7 sought feedback from public on whether the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional."

Reacting to the Allahabad High Court’s observation on triple talaq that this practice among Muslims is unconstitutional and violates the rights of women, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Kamal Faruqi said that ‘it is just an observation by the court, not the decision.’
Faruqui said, “Constitution gives me right to follow my religion. It’s observation by court, not decision.” He also said, “Islam is one of most progressive religions about women’s rights. Talaq is part of Sharia law, no interference should be there.” The High Court also said that no personal law board is above the Constitution.
Pointing out that one has constitutional rights to appeal against any verdict if he/she is not satisfied, AIMPLB’s Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali said, “Respect HC’s verdict but we’ve constitutional right to appeal against the verdict if not satisfied.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Firangi Mahali also said, “AIMPLB’s legal committee will study the verdict and observation and then it will file its appeal against the said verdict.” He said, “I don’t think it’s unconstitutional. If few people misuse law, you take action against them and not remove the law.”
The AIMPLB in November decided to form a women’s wing to discuss the issues of talaq, among several others. It passed a resolution in favour of triple talaq. The resolution passed at the AIMPLB’s three-day convention stated that the government was infringing into the personal laws of Muslims.
It had also decided to launch an all-India Muslim women helpline, a toll free call centre in Urdu, English and eight regional languages to counsel and guide Muslim women on family disputes to go to the Darul-Qaza."

Joined by two Trinamool Congress MPs, Shahi Imam of the Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, Syed Mohammad Nurur Rahman Barkati on Friday charged the Narendra Modi government with trying to “polarise the nation” by “imposing” the Uniform Civil Code. Alleging that the Modi government was trying to “impose” UCC on the Muslims, the Imam called all the Muslims, as well as the Hindus, the Christians, the Dalits and other communities to come together to oppose the move. He was addressing a protest demonstration in front of the Tipu Sultan Mosque at busy Dharamtala area in which two TMC MPs, Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali, were present.

Sultan Ahmed told reporters, “I have come to attend the programme to oppose UCC. There cannot be any uniform civil code in the country. It will disturb the unity of the country. Muslims in the country have been targeted and the Centre is trying to impose UCC on the Muslims. We have inherited the law and we will not allow any interference,” Sultan Ahmed said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked whether it is his party’s view, the MP said, “This is not the TMC office. You ask our party’s national spokesperson about it.” Idris Ali, another TMC MP said that “nobody will be allowed to amend the Quran”. “We will oppose any such move of the Centre and will stop anybody who will try to amend the Quran,” Ali said.
The Shahi Imam also called for a nationwide road blockade protesting the Centre’s move. A rally at the Park Circus Maidan would also be held, he said. For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre on October 7 opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on the grounds of gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to interfere in the religious rights of the Muslims, West Bengal Minister for Mass Education Siddiqullah Chowdhury today said that the state government was opposed to uniform civil code.

“A few days ago during our party’s meeting at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s residence, she said that she had received a letter from the central government seeking state government’s opinion on Uniform Civil Code. “She had immediately replied to the central government stating that Bengal will never implement the Uniform civil Code in the state,” Chowdhury said while addressing a rally by All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).
“If Modi tries to play with the religious rights of the Muslims then the repercussions will be disastrous. Modi and BJP should not forget that India got independence because of the active role of the Muslims. If Muslims had not taken active part, it would have taken 100 years more for India to get its independence,” Chowdhury said.
Several TMC ministers and senior party leaders such as Sultan Ahmed, alleged that the central government was “trying to ban Triple Talaq and impose uniform civil code in the country.”"

That’s when the Ahmedabad-based rubber parts trader will become the first Muslim in Gujarat to get married as per the model nikahnama.
‘‘My family has appreciated my thinking on this and I have taken this conscious decision after fully understanding its conditionalities,’’ he says.
Maniar is one of the many prospective grooms here who have approached the Darul Qaza—shariah court set up by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board —seeking to get married under the nikahnama finalised by the Board recently.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even if it means going against their families’ wishes or clerics saying there’s nothing ‘‘new or innovative’’ in the document. Arif Hasan Mansuri, a clerk at the Darul Qaza, has monitored over 100 cases of marital discord since the court got going in December. And now, this bachelor from nearby Himmatnagar has decided to get married—as per the model nikahnama. ‘‘I don’t care if my family agrees with me or not. This is my independent decision, which I have taken after weighing the pros and cons. After all, what is wrong if a woman gets her rightful dues even if she cannot live with her husband?’’ says Mansuri.
Says Mufti Abdul Qayyum Jaipuri, who is quite upbeat about the model nikahnama: ‘‘We have decided to convene a conference of Qazis and religious clerics in next few weeks for a brainstorming session on how best they can contribute to making the new matrimonial document acceptable and popular among the community.’’
Mufti Qayyum says it may appear that there is nothing in the document that can pass as new ‘‘but certain basic provisions of the Shariah relating to marriage have been made more elaborate and easy to comprehend.’’ The model will succeed, he says, as it has got several first-time features:
• The husband is not encouraged to pronounce triple talaq in one sitting
• Presence of checks on marital status of brides and grooms at the time of nikah
• Permanent guidelines on how to lead married life
• In case of marital discord, the aggrieved party shall refer the matter first to community leaders or the ulema or Shariah court for a resolution
On Mufti Qayyum’s wishlist now: a campaign to introduce and popularise the new document so that clerics can begin educating people.
‘‘Its inherent benefits to both parties will have to be explained to the community in the right perspective,’’ he says.
Mufti Qayyum points out that the model nikahnama would be a boon for couples in mass marriages that are becoming popular among Muslims here—in May, 111 such marriages were solemnised in Ahmedabad.
However, M G Bombaywalla, head of the Sunni Bohra community here, says the success of the model nikahnama depends largely on how the clergy interprets it.
‘‘This is important because the model produced by AIMPLB is not, and cannot be made, mandatory,’’ he says.
However, that has not deterred youngsters like Mohammad Ilyas Shaikh from deciding to get married—next year—as per the model nikahnama. ‘‘With this nikahnama in place, my wife will have protection from the probable harassment she may face from my family when I am away on work,’’ he says."

CONFUSION PREVAILED over the proposed convention of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in Kolkata as the state government is yet to give permission for the three-day meet. Now, Muslim leaders in the city have decided to hold the programme even if they do not get clearance from the government.
Watch What Else Is Making News

Mohammed Kamruzzaman, general secretary of All Bengal Minority Youth Federation, said: “Over 350 leaders will come to Kolkata for the convention. We had earlier written to the state government seeking permission to hold the delegate session at Madinatul Hujjaj at New Town and the mass meeting at Park Circus Maidan but the state government is yet to give its permission. So, in a meeting yesterday it has been decided that we will go on with the programme as per schedule.” Trinamool MPs such as Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali were also present at the meeting.
Kamruzzaman added that while the federation had written to both the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the state minority department regarding permission for the venues, they have not received any reply. “Leaders present at the meeting yesterday said while the last AIMPLB convention in Kolkata was held during the Left Front regime at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra and Park Circus ground, the current regime, which appears to be a patron of the minority community, is against us,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Maulana Niyamat Hossain, president of Milli Ittehad Parishad echoed similar views. “Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is befooling Muslims for a long time now. She was never a wellwisher of Muslims. She had learnt communal politics from the BJP, with which she had been in an alliance earlier,” he said. Hossain claimed either Mamata was under pressure from the Centre not to allow the convention or she would give nod to the convention at the last moment and earn brownie points.
When contacted, Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali said that they were optimistic that the government would give permission for the con. “I am hopeful that the government would relent. I had also suggested that the AIMPLB should be vocal on several issues. For example, it had kept quiet when there was a controversy over Dr Zakir Naik and his TV channel,” Ali said.
Ahmed, also the chairman of AIMPLB organising committee, claimed a solution would be reached on Wednesday. “We will find a solution to it. God willing, the convention will take place here without any trouble,” he said.
Sources said the government would either allow the public meeting at Park Circus Maidan or Mohammedan Sporting Club ground.
Amid a raging debate over Uniform Civil Code and triple talaq in the country, AIMPLB members plan to deliberate on the line of action to be taken over the issues. Describing the twin issues as an “infringement of the personal law and fundamental rights of Muslims”, the AIMPLB said it would give a call for formation of a “secular platform” to counter the BJP and RSS’s “evil designs”.
“The BJP-RSS is trying to infringe into the personal and fundamental rights of Muslims. This will never be tolerated. The upcoming convention will deal with the issues,” Ahmed said. He added that AIMPLB usually sticks to only Muslim personal laws, which broadly cover marriage, talaq, succession and adoption-related issues, but this time it will step beyond its periphery and speak up against religious intolerance in the country.Kolkata NewsWest Bengal phase 3 voting today: Swapan, Ashima among 205 candidatesWon’t let any move to stop polls mid-way: Mamata BanerjeeCoal pilferage: Abhishek dares Centre to start investigation against all culpritsClick here for more

The most insidious truth in the picture headlining the story had escaped me, at least for a moment. Countless centuries of the male privilege in my genes must have been responsible for my momentary inability to recognise the picture for what it was. But then the realisation dawned, like lightning from the heavens above striking deep into my brain, my whole being. It was what has been happening from time immemorial: Men, particularly old men, sitting in judgement on what rights women should or mostly rather shouldn’t have; it had been happening for eons until women rose up in different parts of the world–the likes of Jhansi, Sarojini Naidu and Aruna Asif Ali in India and the suffragettes in the west, just to name some of the countless milestones; then the bra burning and the unshackling of women the world over gathered unstoppable momentum.
Those men in the picture belonged to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB); the privileged of the male privilege, their privilege sanctioned and condoned by religion. They were and are not much different from the Roman Catholics Popes who have so far barred women from being ordained priests, the Hindu priests who have until recently barred women from entering some temples or the Imams who would disallow women in some mosques.
On the day the picture was taken, the Old Men of the AIMPLB were pontificating on the ‘virtues’ of Triple Talaq. That day they declared how the Triple Talaq wasn’t such a bad thing. Without being bogged down in the legal or other niceties of Triple Talaq, it was and remains a monumental obstruction in the way of equality for women. It is as iniquitous now as it was when the Congress regime under Rajiv Gandhi showed utter lack of intestinal fortitude in not enshrining the Shah Bano judgement of the Supreme Court of India into law to begin to give a significant section of Indian women rights they had long demanded and deserved. Rajiv’s government legislatively diluted the effect of the Court’s judgement. But where the politician had failed the people, the Court once again came to the women’s rescue. In subsequent cases it restored the rights first enunciated in Shah Bano.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Old Men in the picture argued that any judicial intervention in the issue of Triple Talaq is “an infringement of the religious rights” of the Muslim community–a facile argument deeming a mere judicial interpretation of the matters under the Constitution of India an infringement. Democracy is nothing if not constitutional. In democracies the elected representatives make the laws and the courts interpret them. The last time I checked India was not a theocracy–at least not yet, although I am afraid one could be forgiven for thinking it is on its way to becoming one–with governments’ and political parties’ platforms talking about building Mandirs per se or Mandirs in places where currently there currently are none; with cow vigilantes’ lawlessness and terror reigning in several parts of India including New Delhi, the seat of India’s government, and the men of the AIMPLB crying foul over judicial intervention on Triple Talaq which they deem a Muslim religious right.
As for the Men’s “infringement of religious rights” argument, it is clear that marriage is a social and cultural construct. Triple Talaq is no more a Muslim religious principle than sati was a Hindu religious principle. They were both social and cultural constructs that over time became subsumed by faith. Sati was indigenous to India and evil. The Triple Talaq traveled with the Muslim travelers, kings and their armies. Originally from Arabia, Triple Talaq became Indian as did the Muslims. It was an Arabian social and cultural practice that was subsumed by Islam. The caste or Sati, sanctioned or not by Hinduism, can’t ever be legitimately claimed as religious principles or allowed religious sanctity. Similarly, whether it happens in three different sittings or one, the Triple Talaq, sanctioned by Islam or not, can’t ever be legitimately elevated into a religious principle obstructing the social and cultural equality of Muslim women. To guarantee the right to freely practice any citizens’ religion is the only obligation a government has vis a vis religion. The government can’t and mustn’t protect gender inequality–be it in the name of religion or otherwise; Period.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board needs to drag itself into the 21st Century. If not, the mounting yearning for real equality among the Muslim women would drag it into the still relatively young century, despite the kicking and screaming of the Old Men of AIMPLB or others."

With a section of the tribal population up in arms against the government’s move seeking opinion of the Law Commission on possibility of having the Uniform Civil Code, the panel said it was “open” to objections and suggestions from the community. “The tribal community should make representation before the Commission. We would also like to know their stand,” Law Commission Chairman B S Chauhan told PTI.
He said the Commission considers tribals as a stakeholder in the entire exercise in which representations are coming from various communities. “The tribals can also participate and debate in the entire exercise,” the former apex court judge said.
The opposition from a section of the tribal community assumed importance as a group has also moved the Supreme Court contending that the government was making an attempt to impose the UCC which will be against their ethos, customs and religious practices. The Rashtriya Adivasi Ekta Parishad, a group that claims to work for protecting Adivasi interests, has filed a petition in the apex court seeking protection of their customs and religious practices, including their right to practice polygamy and polyandry.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Further, it has contended that any attempt to impose the Uniform Civil Code would have adversely impact on their distinct customs, culture and heritage. The petition in the apex court claimed the Adivasis (tribals) had their own personal laws and do not come in the category of Hindus as they worshipped nature instead of idols and performed burial of the dead.
The marriage ceremonies of tribals are also different from that of Hindus, it submitted.
“In case of Uniform Civil Code, the Adivasis’ right to perform marriage, worship, last rites and other ceremonies would be abrogated,” the NGO said. The petition is likely to come for hearing when the apex court will take up a batch of matters relating to the validity of triple talaq and polygamy in the Muslim community."

(Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri)
AMID THE nationwide debate over triple talaq, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged Muslims not to view the issue through a “political lens”, and expressed hope that “enlightened members from within the community” would lead efforts to end the practice. Addressing a function to mark Basava Jayanti, in honour of Kannada philosopher Basaveshwara, Modi said: “Teen talaq ko lekar aaj yeh ek bahut badi behes chal rahi hai. Bharat ke mahan parampara ko dekhte hue, mere bheetar ek aasha ka sanchaar ho raha hai… ki is desh me samaj ke bheetar se hi taqatwar log nikalte hain, jo paramparon ko todte hain, nasht karte hain, aadhunik vyavasthaon ko viksit karte hain… Musalman samaj mein se bhi aise prabuddh log paida honge, aage aayenge, aur Muslim betiyon ko, unke saath jo gujar rahi hai, jo beet rahi hai, unke khilaf wo khud ladai ladenge, aur kabhi na kabhi raasta nikalenge.”
(“There is a debate about triple talaq. Looking at the great traditions of our nation, a hope is rising within me… that powerful people will emerge from within the community who will break the traditions, demolish them and develop a modern system… Enlightened people from within the Muslim community will emerge and come forward to fight against all that Muslim daughters have to undergo… They will find a way out.”)
“Aur Hindustan ke hi prabuddh Musalman niklenge jo duniya ke Musalmanon ko raasta dikhane ki taaqat rakhte hain. Is dharti ki yeh taaqat hain… Ye Bharat ki mitti ki taqat hai ki teen talaq ke sankat se gujar rahi hamari maataon, behenon ko bachane ke liye usi samaj se log aayenge,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
(“India’s enlightened Muslims will show the way to the rest of the community across the world. This is the strength of the soil of India… that people from within the community will come out to save our mothers and sisters who have to suffer triple talaq.”)
“Aur main Musalman samaj ke logon se bhi aagrah karunga ki is masle ko rajniti ke daayre me mat jaane dijiye. Aap aage aaiye, samasya ka samdahan kijiye (I appeal to the Muslim community not to let the issue slip into the realm of politics. Come out and find a solution),” he said.
While his government’s stand against triple talaq has been criticised by prominent Muslim bodies, Modi sought to draw a parallel with Raja Ram Mohan Roy’s fight against social evils. “Society criticised him when he talked of widow re-marriage. But he remained firm… and got it done,” he said.
“People should get homes and access to power without discrimination. Farmers should get fertilisers and insurance benefits without any distinction. That is the meaning of our government’s message of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’,” said Modi.  He also released a digital volume of Basaveshwara’s works, titled Vachan, in 23 languages.  Modi later walked up to the audience to meet the family of Kannada scholar and rationalist M M Kalburgi, who was killed in Karnataka last year."

But her marriage did not work. She decided to stand on her own feet and started by becoming a milk vendor. She tried several other trades–cycle and scooter repair. Today, she plies a taxi between Ahmedabad and Mumbai and earns over Rs. 15,000 a month.
She had been branded and heckled by the male society, but she firmly stood her ground. She spoke about how it felt to be in a male bastion like taxi driving (Ahmedabad Public Hearing dated 11.2.2000), “I love my work and am good at it. No one hesitates to hire my taxi for long journeys because of my sex.”
“Purdah is not about wearing a burqa, it is about modesty and dignity in one’s own eyes.” She has got her son admitted in a boarding school and registered him under her own name.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shamim is one of India’s most empowered Muslim woman.
A reason to rejoice and celebrate. But this may only be an isolated case.
“Muslim women are the weakest link in the generally dis-empowered chain of Indian womanhood,” says Dr Syeda Saiyadi Hameed in her report Voice of the Voiceless"" focussing on the plight of Muslim women in India.
The compelling reason for their backwardness is their poverty, destitution and the absence of economic rights Hameed, former member, National Commission for Women says in her presentation in a symposium on `Voice of the Voiceless’.
“In this regard, Muslim women are neither homogenous, norseparate, nor different from women of other segments of Indian society,” she adds.
It is historical fact that most of Indian Muslims are converts from other religions and social classes. The woman, therefore, carry the social burden of their class into their new identity, although socially they remain part of the old social order.
“The oversimplified picture of burqa-clad Muslim womentends to overshadows their contemporary realities and struggles,” Hameed says adding one must eschew the perception that their status in India is solely attributable to certain Islamic
 features, or that their legal status is entirely the consequence of Muslim law.
Dr Zoya Hasan, Professor of Indian politics at the School of Social Sciences, Jawahar Lal Nehru University, currently doing a research project on Muslim women agrees with the Hameed terming the report as the ""first document which is the authentic voice of Muslim women"".
“The reason generally attributed to their backwardness is the Shariyat which makes them more vulnerable and helpless which is certainly an important factor. But to ascribe it entirely to Islamic features is like giving a simple explanation for a complex phenomenon,” Hasan says.
Commenting on Hameed’s observation Hasan says that the abysmal status is not just restricted to Muslim women in India, but also women from other communities also live in more or less the same condition.
Around 10,000 women (including 2,000 Hindus) from 40districts in ten major cities were included in her survey for her study paper. There are regional and class difference on the comparitive status, though insignificant, so as to say.
Hasan said the comparitive position of Hindu and Muslim men on community specific features like education, mobility, employment and access to welfare programmes was more or less the same.
There are insignificant difference between both communities as far as literacy (upto fifth standard) is concerned, though after fifth standard there is some difference–if 22 per cent of Hindu women are educated beyond fifth standard, then the corresponding figure for Muslim women is 14 per cent, she informs.
Average age of marriage also remains more or less the same with Hindu women marrying at 16 and Muslims at 17-and-half.
Also, there are not enough Madrasas in close vicinity for girls to go and study though their male counterparts go ahead to study in the English medium schools even in far flung areas, she says.
The working status is rather dismal with 86 per cent Muslims unemployed (84 per cent in rural areas), 19 per cent ever worked for cash and only 15 per cent are engaged in economic activities (tailoring, needle work etc) and their Hindu counterparts are productively engaged at 20 per cent.
Ninety per cent of the Muslim women have their income below Rs. 500 and 80 per cent have Rs. 250 monthly whereas 70 pe cent of them are the sole bread earners of the family.
As far as access to welfare activities is concerned, inter-community differnce exists as 50 per cent of Muslim women were not even aware of them whereas Hindu women were more aware of such schemes and programmes and have easier access to them.
""Women below the age of 30 years are educated and are working in good positions in urban areas wheras there seniors are not in such positions in both the areas.""
What is an interesting and note-worthy fact is that as shown above, there are insignificant difference between the status of Hindu and Muslim women wheras the same does not hold true for their male counterparts! There is major difference in literacy, employment, health and access to welfare activities.
Incidentally, Hameed has made some recommendations in her report to the Muslim Samaj as a whole which calls for codification of Muslim Personal Law. “The state can play a constructive role. It can become an agent of change while leaving the substantive matter to the Muslims themselves,” she says.
First wife’s permission should be mandatory before the second marriage is contracted ""as is the practice in practically all Islamic countries"".
The instantaneous verbal triple talaq should be banned and a standard Nikahnaama be made, Hameed says.
“Lack of education has been identified as the single most cause for backwardness of minority women. Special care should be given to schools in Muslim concentrated areas,” she adds in her recommendations addressed to the state."
"1617717049-40","https://indianexpress.com/page/122/?s=Triple+talaq","The truth about Sonia","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/the-truth-about-sonia/","The truth about Sonia","October 18, 2004","Two recent dramas highlight the increasing intervention of the public into the private domain. The first was the rewriting of Gudiya’s life by the custodians of Muslim tradition; the second is the intervention in Sonia’s life by the caste panchayat of village Asanda in Haryana. In both cases, the media jumped into action and brought desi reality TV into our drawingrooms.
These interventions highlight two sets of questions. One deals with the increasingly powerful and retrogressive role of traditional institutions of social control — village and caste panchayats and religious clerics — in people’s private lives. Powerless to promote larger developmental issues affecting their constituents, such bodies instead seek to retain their hold and exercise power in the private domains of family, marriage, inheritance. Thus, issues such as triple talaq bring media attention rather than women’s educational progress or well-being. The community’s battle for turf space in Indian politics since Independence is still being fought in the domain of personal law. Equally, while Nehruvian independent India attempted to reform Hindu panchayats by turning them into institutions for development and local governance, it failed to address their inherently iniquitous nature. Neither did the reform of Hindu personal laws address the power of caste panchayats. As a result, customary law dominates over reformed marriage and inheritance laws. In fact, the power of caste panchayats in the personal domain has remained hidden due to the post-Independence stress on panchayati raj.
The other set of questions deals with the ethics of the media entering into people’s private lives and beaming their trauma as a “live soap opera”. In Gudiya’s case, you have two men, a woman and an unborn child fathered by one of them. The woman claims she wishes to stay with the second husband, the father of her child, while the first says he wants her back. The second is rendered voiceless. The issue is settled by “elders”, a village panchayat again, the guardians of tradition. What could be more juicy for a channel which advertises that Gudiya’s fate will be settled on TV? After the melodrama is over and Gudiya et al are sent back to their pre-TV mundane lives, who will inquire after Gudiya’s trauma or her life’s trajectory? Who will show check whether the child is accepted or not or how the second, now wife-less child-less husband is doing? Television is not concerned with lives that they have altered or ruined once they have got their TRPs.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Cut to Sonia’s case. Sonia and Rampal, married for over a year, are expecting a child. Suddenly, the panchayat declares their marriage is incestuous as their grandparents possibly share the same gotra. But why the delayed reaction? Rathis and Dahiyas, the two Jat clans to which the couple belong, ostensibly have brotherhood ties which “prohibit” marriage. The real objection, however, seems to lie in the jostling for power by these clans. Where traditional power and economic hierarchies of dominant castes and clans are being upset by economic changes, the battle for power is now being fought through hegemony in the private domain.
The gender dimension of this story is no less palpable. Sonia appears to have married Rampal of her own choice, as the marriage took place in the Rohtak district court. In doing so, while asserting her agency (a fact that would instantly turn popular opinion against her) she appears to have scotched her father’s ambitions of marrying her upwards. Significant is the reality that Sonia’s father wanted a “government service” groom. In Haryana today, respect comes with a government job. It is not that government servants or what they do is highly respected. It is the security of life-time employment, a pension and a life-time possibility of graft and bribery that attracts the peasant looking out to diversify his portfolio outside of a plateaued agriculture. The price of a constable’s job in Haryana police runs into several lakhs. Once made, the investment has to be recovered. How else but through the myriad opportunities for bribery? A government job is also compatible with farming and being a landowner.
Haryana families wish to marry their daughters to men with government jobs, preferably those living in towns or cities. The new hypergamy (women marrying upwards) is not of caste status but of job and location. Contacts in cities, businesses and government are the new social capital that can be deployed to corner development gains and political clout in the village.
Can the intervention of the media help to bring about progressive, gender/human sensitive solutions? An interventionist media needs a slightly longer attention span to realise that in present day India, the private is increasingly embroiled with the public, the economic and political with the personal and the personal is becoming political in a very visceral sense. A sincere media can play a role in nudging tradition in a progressive, gender-sensitive direction. It can do this by highlighting the compulsions of intra-caste politics and the role of changing economic circumstances in rewriting caste and gender equations. It needs to sustain its interest in these issues to reveal why “so-called tradition” is protected and defended and what the hidden text of such a defence is. In the Muslim case, it is most likely the protection of the space of influence of the leadership of a minority community; in the Haryana Jat case, it is the changing equations of dominant and upwardly mobile clans in village society."

RAISING THE issue of triple talaq, BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday asked the women of Uttar Pradesh to make “safety of women” an issue in the state Assembly elections.
Addressing a gathering in Sonbhadra district, in eastern UP, before flagging off the ‘Parivartan Yatra’, Shah urged the people to ask the “three parties” — SP, BSP and the Congress — to file an affidavit (in apex court) and make their stand clear: “triple talaq ke saath aap hain ya nahin hain (are you with or against triple talaq)?”
He pointed out that when the Supreme Court recently asked the Narendra Modi government whether the practice of triple talaq should continue, the government had replied that it was committed to ensure rights of women, and that they will get their rights.
Watch What Else is Making Newshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Claiming that other opposition parties — SP, BSP and Congress — are silent on the issue of triple talaq, Shah said, “Magar humey darr nahin hai (We are not scared). I want to use this occasion to urge Uttar Pradesh’s women to help make women’s safety an issue in these elections…. Alongside development of the state and uprooting gunda-gardi (hooliganism), respect for women should also be made an issue.”
Shah earlier slammed Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on the Army’s surgical strike along the LoC in Kashmir and on the issue of One Rank-One Pension and said, “Rahul-ji, sena ke jawano ke maslon par rajneeti karna band karo (stop politicising Army issues).”
In his address, Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha said that in 2012, the people of UP had expected Akhilesh Yadav — “Videsh mein padha hua ek bhola-bhala aur masoom naujawan (a foreign-educated innocent young man)” who denied ticket to D P Yadav — will maintain the rule of law in the state. But, Sinha said, irregularities were done in the name of recruitment and Akhilesh has deputed “numberdaar” (collection agent) in every police station and no FIR can be registered without their consent.
MoS (Finance) Santosh Gangwar and MoS (Health and Family Welfare) Anupriya Patel also addressed the rally."

(Source: Express photo by Tashi Tobgyal)
For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre on Friday opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.

“It is submitted that the issue of validity of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy needs to be considered in the light of principles of gender justice and the overriding principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality,” the affidavit filed by Mukulita Vijayawargiya, Additional Secretary in the Ministry, said.
Responding to a batch of petitions including the one filed by Shayaro Bano challenging the validity of such practices among Muslims, the Centre first dealt with the right of gender equality under the Constitution.
“The fundamental question for determination by this court is whether, in a secular democracy, religion can be a reason to deny equal status and dignity available to women under the Constitution of India,” it said.
Referring to constitutional principles, it said that “any practice by which women are left ‘socially, financially or emotionally vulnerable’ or subject to the whims and caprice of men-folk is incompatible with the letter and spirit of Article 14 and 15 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution”.
Linking the issue with the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, the Centre in its 29-page affidavit said “gender equality and the dignity of the women are non-negotiable, overarching constitutional value and can brook no compromise.
“These Rights are necessary in letter and in spirit not only to realise the aspirations of every individual woman who is an equal citizen of this country but also for the larger well-being of the society and progress of the nation, one half of which is made up by women”."

In the article, similar to many others that have appeared in Economic and Political Weekly in the past, some obscure pamphlets, handbills, posters of dubious authenticity pertaining to the early part of the 20th century are cited as evidence of the “orchestrated propaganda campaigns” of Hindu zealots against mushy love stories between non-Muslim women and Muslim men. The most ridiculous assertion in the article, however, is that religious conversions have traditionally been, and continue to be, one of the common expedients of those on the margins of Hinduism to reject hierarchies. Given the status of women in Islam (of polygamy and triple talaq), by converting to it, a Hindu woman is jumping from the frying pan into the fire.

Propaganda is being disseminated on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook to fan the fear psychosis in western Uttar Pradesh. Hindu women are being projected as victims. However, no reliable data is available about interfaith marriages. One must remember what B.R. Ambedkar said about inter-caste marriages. They act to unify the country and annihilate caste barriers. The same is true of interfaith marriages. Instead of buying into the propaganda, we must exert our critical faculties and discern reason and logic.

Young man’s game
This refers to ‘Congress gearing for generational shift?’ (IE, August 29). The views of senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi are welcome. He is right; politicians above the age of 70 should retire. It would be great if this actually happens. But India’s politics has always been dominated by older leaders. Dwivedi’s comments have certainly ruffled a lot of feathers.

But one man cannot change the system. In fact, Dwivedi is himself touching 70 — he will turn 69 next week. The “youthification” of politics, one fears, remains a

distant dream.

The big bang
The grand launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana by Prime Minister Narendra Modi — the scheme aims to usher in an era in which true financial inclusion will become a reality — was a happy moment. Sixty-seven years have gone by since the country attained Independence. But the grim reality is that access to institutional credit has remained elusive for most. The fact that 1.5 crore new bank accounts have been opened on the launch day itself reflects the government’s commitment to make the scheme a success.

First, the National Commission of Women released the status report on Muslim women in April. This report appropriately titled `Voice of the voiceless’ is based on extensive interviews with women all over the country.
It revealed that the problems of triple, verbal, instantaneous talaqs, multiple marriages, no “mehr” (alimony) and no maintenance were widespread in Muslim society. More importantly, all Muslim women regardless of class were vulnerable to the problems that emanated from sacred texts as interpreted by community patriarchs.
Close on the heels of this report, on June 8, the Calcutta High Court passed a pathbreaking judgement ruling that divorced Muslim women would get a maintenance allowance until they remarried. This ruling came in response to a petition filed by Shakila Parveen, who was deserted by her husband Haidar Ali. By an order passed in 1993, the trial court granted a maintenance of Rs 800 for the `iddat’ period (three menstrual cycles after divorce), plus a `mehr’ of Rs 2,500. Since Ali did not respond to the court directive, Justice Panigrahi observed that the apex court had unequivocally held that section 125 of the CrPC providing for maintenance to all divorced women overruled the personal law.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
What followed was the liberal view of the law which held that the right to receive maintenance cannot be restricted to the period of `iddat’ only. Instead, the appellant should get maintenance allowance till her remarriage. In a similar case, the Bombay High Court provided for maintenance enough to get the divorced Muslim woman going in life. It ruled that the amount of “reasonable and fair provision” though limited to the `iddat’ period should be fixed in order to take care of the woman through her life or till she incurs any disability under the law.
These pathbreaking judgements, reminiscent of the Shah Bano case where the Supreme Court displayed a similar spirit regarding maintenance provisions of Muslim divorcees, express a recognition of the ground reality and an earnest effort to help the divorcees within the prescriptions of the Shariat. These judgements juxtaposed against the Muslim women’s status report of the NCW should have been welcomed by even the diehard conservatives. The verdicts are a reflection of the varied interpretations the Muslim personal law can be put to. Like all other laws, this one too can become either a tool for female oppression or an effective source of redress to aggrieved women. 
Needed is social pressure to prevent the patriarchal monopoly of the law’s provisions. Political recognition of the voice of the larger community, particularly its women, rather than the views of its patriarchal religious leadership alone can make the Muslim personal law an effective force of gender justice.
If the reactions to the NCW report and the judgement by bodies recognised as representative of the Muslim community are any indicator, the diehards are unrelenting in their efforts to retain their control over the community. Not surprisingly, the Muslim Personal Law Board has dubbed both the judgement and the NCW report `controversial.’ The judgement, of course, has been severely criticised as an intrusion into the personal domain of Muslims.
The reactions make it clear that the voice of women has no place in the legal and political discourse of both the upholders of the judgement as well as those like the Personal Law Board that oppose it. For Justice Panigrahi, it was not the NCW status report that provided the reference point of consultation, but the legal provision excluding Muslim women from 125 CrPC. For the opponents, of course, the interests of women have never been central to their discourse on Islamic tradition and law. Ironically, central to the debate on Muslim women have been Indian and Islamic religious and juridical traditions not women themselves, the subjects of the discourse.
The liberal opinion within the community has to help change this situation. It is heartening that at a recent meeting of the Muslim Personal Law Board executive council the NCW report was seen as one worthy of serious note. Such a welcome exercise can bear fruit only when the community begins to think about restructuring the composition of the personal law and other boards so as to introduce at least some element of gender balance in them. Gender justice for Muslim women can only be achieved when they are active participants in institutions that juridicate and legislate on their affairs.

While even the Ahl e Hadith, one of the most reclusive sects among Indian Muslims, has said the same thing, the stand taken by Maulana Mahmood Madani’s organisation is significant as the Jamiat is the largest organisation of imams in India. The Ajmer session was attended by imams of the many madrasas run by the organisation. The Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions questioning the validity of triple talaq.
Quoting the resolution passed at the Ajmer gathering, Madani said, “The session condemned  talaq at one go and appealed to every section of Muslim society to make strides to eliminate it.”
Watch what else is making news: https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The resolution added, “We have to wage jihad against the wrong practices prevalent in nikah and talaq. We have to spearhead the movement to give proper rights to women in accordance with Islam. We will strive to insert such clauses in the nikahnama that will resolve any disputes in martial life.”

Admitting that a Law Commission questionnaire on “reforms” in personal laws had provoked fears of an attempt to push a uniform civil code, Madani said, “The PM has spoken on this and his credentials on this are suspect. So we are not concerned about what he has said. But we feel women in Islam have been given their due and we must ensure that happens practically. That is central to Islam.”
At a rally in UP on October 24, PM Narendra Modi had said “lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be ruined by triple talaq”.
Madani said the Jamiat had started persuading people to adopt the kabin nama, which is like a pre-nuptial agreement. “There had been a move in 2005, at our 28th session, to have the kabin nama along with the nikahnama. Like a prenuptial agreement, the kabin nama requires designation of two representatives each on both sides to mediate in case of irreconcilable differences between couples, so that women can get divorce easily.”

The Muslim personal law also provides for “khula”, where a wife can unilaterally ask for divorce.
The Jamiat resolution also made its stand clear against a uniform civil code, calling it fundamental violation of the compact of India where religious minorities are free to practise their faith. “We consider practising and preserving our religious identity and dealing with our internal matters in accordance with the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah our constitutional rights,” said the resolution."

(Express Photo: Javed Raza)
In Shayara Bano’s petition on triple talaq, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan has filed a new plea saying it is not calling for a uniform civil code but wants triple talaq declared un-Islamic. Zakiya Soman, co-founder of the movement, describes how she is walking fine line between the Muslim right that wants triple talaq to continue and the Hindu right that wants it replaced with a uniform civil code. Excerpts from interviews with her:
You are arguing for being strictly within the parameters of Islamic law. Why?
Muslim women, like most women in India, are believers and want a solution within the Quranic framework. Besides, it is their constitutional right to practise the faith they want to. If they are Muslim, they should remain Muslim and yet be seen as equal as Islam recognises women as equals. All communities have personal laws based on their religious texts, so why should Muslim women be made to feel they need to leave the fold to be seen as equals?

In the Shah Bano case, the argument was that Muslim women needed rescuing from Islamic law itself. How is the current case different?
A lot has changed since 1986. There are a number of Muslim women who have become aware of their rights and are demanding justice. Enlightened Muslims have also been able to reach out to women much more now since 1986.
How have other countries that have outlawed triple talaq managed?
All Muslim countries have codified their laws, and have managed to address different aspects of personal law. The practice of triple talaq has a history. Abu Hanifa, while addressing the problems of women at a specific time in history, who were kept hanging and not divorced, brought in this provision to ensure women could be free from marriages that were not fair and unequal. Now, a small blip in history is being used by men who want to shake off their responsibility and subjugate women under the threat of being able to divorce them in a jiffy.
Will Islamic law on India ever be codified? Isn’t the problem of too many schools insurmountable?
We have to work for codification and it will happen… The many schools of argument are meant more for obfuscating the debate.
Why are even Muslim women aalimas in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board hostile to the idea of courts striking down triple talaq as un-Islamic?
That is simple to understand and is not a problem just here. This is just like some sadhvis who speak the language of VHP and Bajrang Dal… About 92% of women whom we surveyed want a ban on unilateral divorce. Moreover we have had two national hearings where women have narrated their stories. We have had publications narrating the stories of victims. Currently we have a photo campaign running on Facebook where women victims have shared their stories of victimisation. About 50,000 women signed a petition asking for a ban on oral divorce.
Does the BJP being in power make your case complicated?
Yes and no. Let us remember the courts gave justice to Shah Bano, it was political interference that overrode the verdict. The BJP no doubt has a very divisive agenda based on it three pet projects, of which a uniform civil code is one. But how can we have a uniform civil code if people feel it goes against their right of religion? We should allow the courts to do their job and reconcile gender justice and the right to religion… Will the Hindu right agree to a marriage without the kanyadan or seven pheras? No, they won’t. Then why should others give up rights enshrined in the Constitution of right to worship or not worship as per your choice? Our point is that the 1937 colonial law that allows Muslim personal law [Shariat Act] should be properly implemented in the true spirit of Islam.
Will India ever see Article 44 [uniform civil code] operational?
We are not arguing for the uniform civil code. That is is not the solution, in any case once the move failed the answers were provided by the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu Succession Act and various amendments to the Christian Marriage & Divorce Act, etc. Plus the Special Marriages Act is virtually a uniform civil code for anyone who wants to marry as per secular law. This issue has been needlessly politicised. Women are equal in Islam and Indian Muslim women must also be allowed to exercise that right and not pushed back by either the Muslim right or the Hindu right.
Is there any scope of Muslim men speaking for women’s rights?
Muslim men recently signed up to demand abolition of this practice. In a short span of a few days close to 225 men, some of them very prominent Muslims, signed up against the practice."

Many social practices that reflect social inequalities hide behind the cover of religion. Personal laws under British administrators were drawn from diverse sources. It reflected the gender prejudices of its times since the interpreters of “religion” have been mostly men. The process of reforming regressive practices also began during the British rule. Reformers ended practices like Sati and child marriage. Conservative sections in the society opposed these reforms and insisted that these be preserved in the name of “defence” of religion.
Many campaigns for social reform are continuing among both Hindu and Muslim communities. Some of the campaigns to let women enter temples where they were not allowed — like Shani Shingnapur — have been effective. Similarly, Muslim women are demanding entry to Haji Ali Dargah, where they are not allowed since the past five years. It is against this background that the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) launched a campaign against triple talaq. A survey done by BMMA shows that around 92 per cent Muslim women are opposed to this abominable practice.
The BMMA has already collected the signatures of 50,000 Muslim women to oppose the triple talaq and also to oppose talaq halala. In triple talaq, a man can pronounce talaq three times and throw the wife out of the house. In talaq halala, if the husband decides to take her back, she has to get married to someone else, consummate the marriage, and then divorce the new husband before she can return to the earlier husband. Many maulanas offer this service of being “temporary husbands”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As per the BMMA, both these practices are un-Islamic. It points out that such practices are not mentioned in the Quran. A memorandum submitted to National Commission for Women mentions that, “The instant method of divorce has no mention in the Quran. In fact, the Quranic method requires a 90-day process of dialogue, reconciliation and mediation before divorce takes place.” Many Islamic scholars endorse the BMMA’s stand. However, the Muslim personal law board and Jamaat-e-Isalmi do not agree with the BMMA. The Jamaat is planning a campaign to oppose the efforts of Muslim women for reforming personal laws. There are many progressive groups, prominent activists and writers from the community, who have declared solidarity with the agitating women. However, these people are being dubbed by conservatives as supporters of Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a pet theme of the BJP and the RSS.
The fact is triple talaq is banned in over 21 Muslim majority countries including Pakistan. The rights of religious minorities for culture, right to life and affirmative action need to be supported. At the same time, the process of reform within the community must also be upheld and supported on moral, social and legal grounds.
The demand for personal law reforms by Muslim women and the BJP-RSS call for UCC are not comparable. The RSS is inherently patriarchal and its pro-UCC stance is merely to intimidate the religious minorities. The same RSS had opposed the Hindu Code Bill (HCB) drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar. The RSS was against the reforms proposed in the HCB. The opposition from conservatives in the Hindu community, including many elements in the Congress, forced the Nehru government to dilute Ambedkar’s draft of the HCB.
RSS leader M.S. Golwalkar was a strong opponent of UCC. Later, in the wake of Shah Bano judgment, when dominant Muslim groups opposed the court ruling in the name of Muslim personal law, the RSS began to demand UCC. In any case, UCC was initially a demand of the women’s movement.
The basic point which emerged from the making of the HCB was that most personal laws reflect the hierarchical notions of society and thereby accord secondary status to women. So what we need are gender just personal laws. The gender just code in turn has to be the same for all the communities and, hence, it will be uniform. Gender justice has to be the basis of uniformity; blind uniformity may turn out to be most unjust for women.
Can non-Muslims opine on the issue of Muslim personal laws? This writer wants the rights of minorities to be respected across nations. This includes the rights of women, who are a minority in power structures. Movements like the BMMA seeks to reform personal laws by exploring the space available within the Quran. Needless to say, there are multiple interpretations of the Quran. The BMMA, which strives to privillege the humane and just aspects of the teachings of a religion, needs to be supported.
The personal law question needs to be understood in the context of patriarchy. All reform movements that challenge patriarchy call for our support. Gender equality has to be prioritised over conservative interpretations of religious scholars. We do need to say a big no to triple talaq and polygamy."

JOINED BY two Trinamool Congress MPs, Shahi Imam of the Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, Syed Mohammad Nurur Rahman Barkati, on Friday warned that Modi government that if it tried to abolish the triple talaq system, his party will be finished.

Alleging that the Modi government was trying to “impose” Uniform Civil Code on the Muslims, the Imam called all Muslims, as well as Hindus, Christians, Dalits and other communities to come together to oppose the move. “If Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to abolish Quran, talaq or Muslim personal laws, his party will be finished… As many as 40 crore Muslims of India will teach them a lesson. Talaq is in the Quran, so nobody can abolish it,” Barkati said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He was addressing a protest demonstration in front of the Tipu Sultan Mosque at Esplanade, in which two Trinamool MPs — Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali — were present. The dharna, which went on for around 40 minutes, led to severe traffic snarls. The shahi imam also called for a nationwide road blockade protesting the Centre’s move. A rally at the Park Circus Maidan would also be held, he said.
Speaking at the protest, Sultan Ahmed said: “Quran cannot be amended or abolished and talaq is already mentioned in the Quran… No government can interfere in the teachings of Quran, talaq or personal laws of Muslims.”
“There cannot be any uniform civil code in the country. It will disturb the unity of the country. Muslims in the country have been targeted and the Centre is trying to impose uniform civil code on the Muslims. We have inherited the law and we will not allow any interference,” he added. Asked whether it is his party’s view, the MP said, “This is not the Trinanmool office. You ask our party’s national spokesperson about it.”
Idris Ali, maintaining that “nobody will be allowed to amend the Quran”, said: “We will oppose any such move of the Centre and will stop anybody who will try to amend the Quran.” He appealed to all to join the conference to be organised by All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Sunday against the code.
Besides Ahmed and Ali, Trinamool leaders Ahmed Hassan Imran, Mohammad Kasim and Mukhtar Ali also participated in the event.
For the first time in India’s constitutional history,the Centre on October 7 had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on the grounds of gender equality and secularism.

The Supreme Court on Thursday referred the plea challenging Muslim’s practice of ‘tripla talq’, nikah halala and polygamy to constitutional bench, saying these are ‘important issues’ and involve sentiments. A bench of judges comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud observed that issues required a detailed hearing and referred it to a five-judge constitution bench. “If we will not decide it now, it will not happen for years and decades,” the bench said, adding it was open to hearing the matter on even Saturday and Sunday during the summer vacation which would commence from May 11.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), however, has objected to court’s adjudication of these matters, maintaining these practices stemmed from the Holy Quran and were not justiciable. The Board had also said that the validity of Mohammedan Law, founded essentially on the Holy Quran and sources based on it, cannot be tested on the particular provisions of the Constitution.
Several Muslim women in the past have challenged the practice of triple talaq in which the husband, quite often, pronounces talaq thrice in one go, sometimes even by phone or text message. on the other hand the practice of Nikah Halala is intended to curb incidence of divorce under which a man cannot remarry his former wife without her having to go through the process of marrying someone else, consummating it, getting divorced, observing the separation period called ‘Iddat’ and then coming back to him again.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Centre had last opposed in the apex court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims. In its affidavit, the Ministry of Law and Justice, had referred to constitutional principles like religious practices, international covenants, gender equality, secularism and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to assert that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court. The court had taken suo motu cognizance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in the event of divorce or due to other marriages of their husband.
Victim of triple talaq, writes to PM Modi to ban the practice
Meanwhile, a pregnant woman on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to ban the controversial practice, after she was was abandoned by her husband. She has also sent a copy of the letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. A mother of two-daughters Shafugta, when got pregnant for the third time, her in-laws asked her to abort it fearing it might be a girl as well.
Refusing to do the same, the woman underwent torture and physical abuse. In the rage of anger, her husband Shamshad verbally gave her Triple Talaq and stranded her. “Refusing to go for abortion, they beat me mercilessly. My husband then verbally gave me Triple Talaq and threw me out of the house.”
The helpless Shagufta has now written to the Prime Minister urging him to ban the practise, also reminding him that she exercised her power to vote in his favour."

“This is a secular country. Every community should behave in a civilised manner. Members of every community have the right to live with dignity. No one can force them to live separately,” a Bench of Justice Ruma Pal, Justice C K Thakker and Justice Markandey Katju observed. It also asked the state government to reply to the petition filed by the hapless woman, Nazma Biwi, of Kantabania village in Orissa’s Bhadrak district within two weeks. She had sought the apex court’s intervention in the matter claiming that the NHRC and the Orissa High Court had not come to their rescue.
Nazma had married Sher Mohammad in 1992 and the couple had four children from the marriage. On July 3, 2003 Mohammad had a drunken brawl with his wife and in an inebriated condition, shouted talaq three times. Later, back in his senses, he realised his mistake and the couple continued to live together.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But they faced stiff opposition from the villagers, who claimed that as per Islamic law, they had been divorced under the triple talaq rule. The locals even chased Mohammad away from the village. The local Jammat also issued a fatwa against their staying together.

At 9 pm, the nation is considering observing 2 minutes of silence – at least till that familiar voice emanates from our TV sets yet again. The man who has dominated the 9 pm news slot on Indian television for the past decade or so, Arnab Goswami, has reportedly resigned from Times Now to start a venture. ‘Never ever ever ever again’ in the near future will people bear witness to debates that would challenge acceptable decibel levels, be more entertaining than an Ekta Kapoor serial, ask uncomfortable questions that Nation wants to know (whether the said Nation knew of its query or not), guests being reduced to tears on live TV or throwing mics and stomping off with such delicious frequency.

That will be a void that many will clamour to fill, but for now it seems like an uncomfortable quiet will rule the nights. Even Diwali has just gone by, and this explosion (as one Twitterati pointed out) came a day after. But when met with such a ‘loss’, the human tendency is to look back at the best times – and that is exactly what we’re doing here.
From when Goswami grilled Abhijit Mukherjee on his controversial comment on ‘dented and painted women’ and that awesome exchange with BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi on ‘never ever ever ever again’ having to be questioned on his integrity (we thank him for the various mash-up and remix inspiration he provided) as a journalist to the very recent incident of ruthlessly asking ex-ACP Shamsher Khan Pathan to leave the triple talaq debate and not to ever forget, his propensity to always voice what ‘the Nation wants to know’!

Thirteen-year old Aradhana Samdariya’s death due to observance of 68 days of upavasa (fasting), a customary practice to attain purity, pardon and prosperity in Jainism, reveals yet another facet of lawlessness habitually nurtured by sellers and customers of religious conformism in India. Owing to the political credence accorded to religious groups, the Indian state has chosen to remain strangely ambiguous in its stand against unscientific practices propagated within most of these groups.
They revel in aggressive indifference to the rules of constitutional conduct and have conveniently charted out alternative spaces that celebrate customary conduct premised upon religion or race. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 and the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 are examples of traditional social practices finding their way into the legal and political mainstream.
Though defended by many as integral to Indian culture and heritage, any intellectual assessment would lay bare the incongruity of many traditional practices vis-à-vis human rights. The regressive triple talaq or the blanket dismissal of marital rape is indicative of some of the frailties of traditional law. Historically, women have been at the receiving end of these patriarchy-driven practices.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
For centuries, caste-based discrimination, proudly sponsored by Brahmanical traditions, has been responsible for some of the worst forms of human rights violations, cutting across gender lines, in the country. Post-independence, it was institutionally abolished through the enactment of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in 1989. However, fears of political ramifications have possibly been the reason for the survival of some of the most regressive forms of traditional practices in our country.
A crucial group that has been the silent victim of harmful traditional practices is children. Children constitute about 39 per cent of the total population of the country. Less reported harmful practices that they suffer include female genital mutilation, unscientific male circumcision, ritualistic piercing of the skin and the public celebration of puberty. Children possibly constitute the only group of rights holders, apart from animals and plants, that are solely dependent on the empathy of individuals outside their own group, for making their aspirations heard.
Three years after its adoption in the United Nations General Assembly, sound political wisdom helped usher in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to India, in the year 1992. This treaty institutionalised concepts of international law as it pertains to children. Otherwise treated as objects of charity and as the property of their parents, this treaty changed the way the world looked at children. Children were now to be seen as individual human beings and as the carriers of rights. By ratifying this treaty, India committed itself to the pursuit of the standards set forth in the treaty, necessary to uphold the human rights of children in the country.
There have been some progressive policy changes, post ratification. For instance, corresponding to Article 28 of the CRC, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education was enacted in the year 2009. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was enacted in 2012, with reference from Articles 19 and 34 of the CRC. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act), enacted in 2016, drew inspiration from Articles 3, 9, 16, 20, 25, 27, 32, 37, and 39 of the CRC. The Child Labour (Prohibition and regulation) Act of 1986 was amended in 2016 to meet the provisions laid out in Article 32 of the CRC.
However, enactment or amendment of laws doesn’t necessarily lead to effective implementation. The reasons for the lack of effective implementation of Indian laws vary from institutional drawbacks, individual behavioural transgressions on the part of those holding positions of authority, tedious judicial processes resulting in limited conviction, to corruption, lack of general awareness and, crucially, the acceptance of harmful traditional practices as a part of the social and political mainstream.
Aradhana’s death bears witness to the inadequacy of the Indian state to protect the rights of its children. Jain leaders have passed an edict barring the state from interfering in the religious affairs of the community, despite the death of a child. The failure so far to bring to book the parents for violations under the Indian Penal Code and the JJ Act is indicative of the fear of retribution, owing to the influence of the community in the larger political spectrum.

To prevent more deaths like Aradhana’s, India must outlaw all forms of harmful traditional practices. While it is important to preserve and celebrate our rich social and cultural traditions, it is doubly important to ensure that, under the veil of preservation of traditions, the human rights of our children are not infringed upon. We have abolished Sati and the prohibition on widow remarriage. Now we must abolish the practice of fasting amongst children in the Jain community."

How hopeful are you of an alliance among the Samajwadi Party, the RLD, the JD(U) and the RJD in Uttar Pradesh?
In the situation that prevails today, everybody feels an alliance is needed. When parties think they can win alone, they don’t go for a alliance. They talk about that only when they feel that the emerging political situation requires it. I believe there is a situation in Uttar Pradesh that warrants an alliance. I had already said such an alliance is the need of the hour to check the BJP.
You, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Yadav attended the Samajwadi Party’s silver jubilee. After that, should there be any more doubts over the alliance?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Everybody on the stage was in favour of an alliance. But that sentiment is a separate thing… We all have to realise that if we want an alliance, it is not going to happen in the way that any one of us desires; a lot of give and take needs to be done. There cannot be two opinions on it — no alliance takes shape unless you are ready to give and take.
Nitish Kumar of the JD(U) did not attend the silver jubilee. Doesn’t that indicate doubts do remain over an alliance?
But Sharad Yadav was there.
Nitish has argued that it cannot be called a grand alliance unless the BSP too joins.
He was objecting to the expression maha gathbandhan being used. What happened in Bihar was that two bitter rivals — both major parties — RJD and JDU joined hands. Here [in UP] the SP and the BSP are two major parties… but this [their coming together] is not possible here. An alliance among other parties is possible.
BSP chief Mayawati has said the alliance will only help the BJP, while BJP chief Amit Shah has said it will have no effect as people are already with the BJP.
The reality is that both the BJP and the BSP are panicking over this effort to stitch together a grand alliance. The BSP gets its core vote but that is not enough to form a government in UP unless the floating votes come to it. Besides, if the grand alliance happens, Muslim consolidation in favour of the BSP will not happen. Muslims will vote for a party that can defeat the BJP and the grand alliance will be in that position.
How effective will the grand alliance be against the BJP if the BSP is out of it?
This depends on the situation. Elections are three or four months away but no one knows what situation will emerge; what is the situation today and what it will turn into next week, no one knows. If you look back at the last three months, single events have led to a change of situation. I still believe there is no clarity about UP so far.
So, does that mean there is a hitch in the formation of a grand alliance?
I am not saying there is any hitch. Let talks begin formally. I am positive about the alliance. When talks start, we will know what are the issues that are to be discussed.
Will the Congress be part of such an alliance? If it is, how important would the Congress be in the alliance?
I have not yet talked to any Congress leader, nor has there been any talk between Mulayam Singh Yadav and me on this. As far as importance is concerned, every party is important.
There is a perception that different factions in the SP have different views on an alliance and that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is not very enthusiastic about it.
I don’t know about that. As far as factions are concerned, every party has factions, not just two but even four or five.
The RLD fared poorly in the Lok Sabha polls. What will it bring to the table?
Parties lose and win elections. These are normal things. Every party is important. The RLD has a social base in western UP that cannot be wished away.
What happened to the earlier plan for a JD(U)-RLD alliance with smaller parties like the Peace Party?
We were about to start addressing joint rallies. But now a situation has emerged. Let us first see how this pans out.
What happened to the merger plan — SP, JDU, RLD, SJP, JDS, INLD — started over a year ago? Could the alliance be a precursor to a merger plan?
That came to an end in February. Right now it is difficult to say anything about it. Nothing is being discussed about it [a merger] nor is there any need to. Elections are just three months away.
Amit Shah has said that like in the last Lok Sabha polls, western UP [where the RLD draws its strength] will support the BJP again. Issues like triple talaq and migration of Hindus from Kairana have also come up.
The BJP-led government at the Centre has completed 2½ years and done nothing for farmers or made any progress on issues like bringing back black money. They have no other alternative to come to power except by communalising the election and triggering riots. But such attempts will fail."

A Muslim organisation based out of Bareilly has offered a reward of Rs 10 lakh to whoever beheads Islamic scholar Tarek Fatah, the Hindustan Times reported on Saturday. The organisation, All-India Faisan-e-Madina Council, also demanded that Fatah’s show ‘Fatah Ka Fatwa’ which is being aired on a private news channel, be banned.
Moeen Siddique, the head of the council, told HT that Fatah wanted to create discord between Hindus and Muslim and was an agent of the enemies of both the religions. “Tarek Fatah is conspiring to disrupt harmony between Hindus and Muslims. He is as an agent of our enemies. He must be stopped at any cost and our organisation will pay Rs 10,00,786 to any person who will decapitate him,” he said, adding, “He and his programme are being funded by foreign enemies of our country and the government must initiate an inquiry against him.”
Watch what else is making news:

https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Siddique voiced his displeasure about Fatah’s program where the latter urges women to give up the burqa and brands triple talaq as ‘haram’, saying Muslims should not listen to these ideologies and instead, come up in arms against him.
The All-India Faisan-e-Madina Council is not the only organisation displeased with Tarek Fatah. Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa, another organisation, wrote a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, saying that ‘fatwa’ is a religious edict and the word cannot be used frivolously. They also demanded a ban on the TV show.
Tarek Fatah is a Canadian liberal activist who speaks against Islamic fundamentalism. He is also the founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress. Fatah was recently hounded at the Jashn-e-Rekhta festival by a group of people who were attending the festival."

The Muslim body has claimed that any order against Triple Talaq would be an infringement on their right to follow and profess any religion.
Many Muslim-majority counties such as Pakistan and Indonesia have removed this practise, but India, with world’s third-largest Muslim population continues to allow it."

TARGETING CHIEF Minister Akhilesh Yadav for allegedly appealing to his Minister Gayatri Prajapati — absconding in a gangrape case — to surrender, BJP national president Amit Shah said in Varanasi on Friday that the Amethi MLA will be arrested immediately after BJP forms the government in UP. Prajapati, the SP candidate from Amethi — which had voted on February 27 — and his aides have been booked in a case of gangrape lodged in Lucknow.

Speaking to mediapersons in Varanasi, Shah claimed that Akhilesh, through the media, has appealed Prajapati to surrender to the police. “It is the responsibility of the government to arrest culprits in criminal cases. But the UP chief minister is helplessly appealing to Pajapati to surrender because his police cannot arrest him,” he alleged.
“The FIR in the case was registered on the directive of the Supreme Court but Prajapati continued his election canvassing. The chief minister too campained for him and Prajapati became untraceable immediately after polling ended. There could be no other example of poor law and order than this particular case,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Regarding action on Prajapati if BJP comes to power, Shah said, “BJP ki sarkar bante hi turant paataal mein se bhi unhe dhoondh kar arrest kiya jayega (The moment BJP forms the government, he would be immediately arrested from wherever he hides).” He added that ‘achche din’ will begin in UP after the formation of the BJP government on March 11.
Targeting BSP chief Mayawati for inducting jailed don Mukhtar Ansari, Shah said: “BSP leaders, in their election meetings, are promising to end gundaraj and restore law and order in UP. People are asking BSP leaders how could they meet the promises while having Mukhtar and his brother Afzal Ansari in the party.” Mukhtar is BSP candidate from Mau Sadar where polling is scheduled on Saturday.
Reiterating BJP’s stand on triple talaq, Shah said the practice was not protecting rights of Muslim women. “Triple talaq is unconstitutional and should be scrapped,” he added."

Both the All India Shia Personal Law Board and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board were set up in Lucknow around the same time — in 2005. The two new boards were distinct from the existing custodian of Muslim personal law in India — the All India Muslim Personal Law Board — and appeared to address different and discrete constituencies within the community: Shia Muslims and Muslim women.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board was set up in 1973, the trigger being a fear that Muslim identities were being scrubbed, and that the promise that Muslims would be able to practise their faith in full pursuit of Article 25, was under threat.
Muslim insecurities, rising since the early 1960s, had spiked especially after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964. This was the time that communal riots, especially in Jabalpur and Ranchi, had resurfaced after a long time. It was also the time when, the AIMPLB web site records, the “Government of India was trying to subvert Shariah law… through parallel legislation. Adoption Bill had been tabled in Parliament. Mr H R Gokhle, then Union Law Minister, had termed this Bill as the first step towards Uniform Civil Code.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As the AIMPLB sought to weld Indian Muslims together, bringing all sects under one umbrella, Shias, although far smaller in population than Sunnis but more influential than their numbers indicated, were well represented in the Board. That situation has not changed — and Lucknow-based Kalbe Sadiq and Kalbe Jawwad, and other Delhi and Hyderabad-based Shia clerics continue to be members of the Board.
Differences in Shia and Sunni family laws and “indifference” of the umbrella Board were cited as reasons for the emergence of the Shia Board. At the time of its formation in 2005, Maulana Mohammed Athar, founder president of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, told the BBC, “It was time that we stood for our rights. We have formed a forum of ourselves because the AIMPLB never took interest in our well being.” Members of the breakaway group expressed scepticism over the way the AIMPLB was being run.
But the constitution of the Board set up in 2005 did not match the seriousness and stature of those in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. Said a member about the Shia Board, “Just look at the meetings and the proceedings, and those who constitute the new Board”. Doubts about its politics, and why it was felt necessary to break away, remain the dominant theme of any discussion about the ‘new’ Board.
When it split from the umbrella Board, the Shia Board had 69 members, and the support of the former ruling Shia family of Lucknow. The AIMPLB at the time had 204 members. The positioning of a set of lesser-known clerics as alternate voices against Kalbe Sadiq and Kalbe Jawwad signalled an intent to undercut the influence of the umbrella body in the affairs of Indian Muslims. This was significant because Shia-Sunni political faultlines have never been deep or sharp in India — except perhaps in Lucknow, where trouble has been reported around celebrations. It is, then, no surprise that it was in Lucknow that the Shia Board came up.
The Shia Board’s support for a ban on cow slaughter, its call to the central government to enact a law to ban triple talaq, and its endorsement of the Supreme Court’s suggestion to settle the Ayodhya dispute outside courts, run counter some of the AIMPLB’s flagship political concerns. The AIMPLB, which came to attention nationally in the late 1980s in the context of the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, is today a litigant in a range of matters including those related to Ayodhya and Muslim marriage and divorce, and especially triple talaq.
On the Shia Board’s support for the cow-slaughter ban, supposedly based on a fatwa by a Iraq-based Shia cleric, a Lucknow-based member of the AIMPLB, Khalid Firangimahli, said, “One should not change one’s opinion based on who is in power in Delhi. It has been a widely accepted and acknowledged belief for hundreds of years amongst leading Muslim elite in India, that where the law says clearly, like in North India, that there must not be cow slaughter, there should be none. Even Emperor Akbar instructed his sons to be careful. All laws must be respected. But will the government move to ban cow slaughter in Goa and the Northeast too?
“What the Shia Board spokesman has said is nothing very unusual. It is something that has been accepted by all of us — that the law must be followed. But it is being twisted to push sizeable sections of Indians, mostly Muslims, against the wall by making such statements now. This kind of politics is not good politics,” Firangimahli said.
The Indian Express had on Thursday reported the statement of Maulana Ejaz Athar of the Shia Board, who said that a fatwa against cow slaughter had also been issued by a Shia cleric in India “around 40 or 50 years ago”, and that “a person should follow the laws of the country where he lives”.
While the AIMPLB is seen as largely oppositional to the values of the VHP and the BJP/RSS, there is no such positioning in the Shia Muslim Personal Law Board. Yasoob Abbas, the Shia Board’s chief spokesperson, had backed the BJP in the recent elections, and is seen to be close to the party, and especially to Home Minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh. Members of the older personal law boards note that he has been part of Muslim delegations to the Prime Minister “at least thrice”. To the old guard, the battles of the All India Shia Personal Law Board and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board are directed more at breaking with the larger umbrella body than at addressing purportedly unaddressed concerns.
Said Lucknow-based Zafaryab Jilani, legal counsel for the AIMPLB, “It is easy for them (the Shia Board) to take positions on triple talaq and nikah halala, as the particular sect they come from don’t recognise it. Within the larger Muslim Personal Law Board, there are several sections, like the Ahle Hadees, that do not agree with triple talaq. But some sects do. So we need to take a more measured view.”"

“Similar is the position of women in this country. There are a lot of very empowered women. But again there are cases of female foeticide also in India,” she says.

So far, the triple talaq and divorce obtained after three sittings with each sitting separated by three months reflected a gender bias with the husband having the right to divorce his wife. However, this position may change after the Board’s Kanpur meeting with the lone woman member in the 41-strong male-dominated executive committee, Naseem Iqtidar Ali Khan, determined to raise the issue.
‘‘Muslim aurton ko tafviz-e-talaq ka haq milna chahiye (Muslim women should have the right to divorce their husbands),’’ says Iqtidar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A strong supporter of equal rights for Muslim women, she wants that ‘‘a clause should be inserted in the nikahnaama giving women also the right to divorce their husbands and if this is brought into practice, it would be a landmark decision.’’ She told The Indian Express that she would initiate discussion on this subject as, for her, this was not an unusual demand as it was within the framework of the shariat law.
This concept was first introduced at the Board’s Bangalore convention in 2000 and copies of the resolution were distributed among the members. However, it remained a non-starter after opposition by the dominant Board members.
However, this time, the issue is likely to generate a groundswell of support. As Rukhsana Lari, another woman on the Board says, ‘‘Islam mein aurton ko bahut huq mile hain, bas humko ekjut hokar ek level laana chahiye (Muslim women have been given many rights. What is needed is unanimity to obtain them).’’ But equal rights for women has rarely figured on the Board’s meeting agenda, as was evident at the three-day workshop held at Jamia Millia a couple of months back. ‘‘Vested interests should be kept out,’’ says Lari. Though not an executive member, Lari said, she may attend the coming meeting.
Opposition from the Board members on giving talaq rights to Muslim women was mainly related to the concept of khula, wherein a woman can end her marriage, but she has to forego mehar (alimony fixed at the time of nikah).
Says Dr Safiya Naseem, a woman member of the Board, ‘‘Talaq ka haq sirf mardon ko hai aur aurton ko khula ka haq hai (Men have the right to talaq, but women have to right to khula). Though both talaq and khula terminate the matrimonial alliance, the basic difference between the two is that in the former, the husband gives the mehar amount to the wife at the time of divorce, but in the latter, the wife has to forego the amount.
Says Iqtidar Ali, ‘‘If the Muslim women are given talaq rights, they would not have to forego mehar.’’"

Uttar Pradesh poll outcome will bring about a major change in the course of country’s politics BJP chief Amit Shah today said even as he termed the fledgling SP-Congress alliance as a “last minute stop gap arrangement”. “A BJP tsunami will soon hit Uttar Pradesh, heralding a major change in the course of country’s politics,” he said, discounting as “remote” the possibility of the state throwing up a hung Assembly. “The results will bring to a halt dynastic and caste-based politics,” he told a press conference here in the midst of hectic electioneering in the poll-bound state. Shah said the name of Congress president is decided at the time of birth itself. “This is not the case with BJP,” he said. Referring to the pre-poll tie up between SP and Congress, he said, “It was a last minute stop gap arrangement. An alliance is always between two political parties and ideologies. This is an unholy alliance and looks like an alliance between two corrupt families.” “By forging an alliance of two corrupt families, Akhilesh Yadav has already conceded defeat,” he said.

Shah also said Ram Manohar Lohia, a socialist, fought Congress throughout his life, but SP forged an alliance with the same party.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Taking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP chief said, “If he was that confident of winning the assembly elections solo, he would have never joined hands with Congress. By doing so, he has accepted defeat even when elections are not midway through.
To a question on BJP giving tickets to children of its MPs, ministers and senior leaders, Shah said, “In parties like Congress, the name of the party president is decided at the time of birth itself.
“…from Jawaharlal Nehru to Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and then to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi…This is called dynastic politics,” he said.
Shah said in SP the case was similar as party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav handed over the baton to son Akhilesh. He said the son or daughter of a BJP MP or senior leader gets the party ticket only after he or she has proved utility as a party worker.

“The scenario is completely different in the two cases,” he said.
Shah exuded confidence that BJP will storm to power with two-thirds majority. “We will form government UP, Goa and Uttarakhand,” he said but refrained to saying anything on Punjab poll results.
To a question on triple talaq, he said time has come to end the practice.
Citing the NCRB data, Shah said the entire law and order machinery in Uttar Pradesh has collapsed.
“If there is one thing in which UP has surpassed other states, it is crime and corruption. UP occupies the top slot in terms of crime. Poor people, farmers, women and traders feel insecure,” he claimed.
“Only cosmetic development has taken place in the state,” the BJP chief said.
He also showered praise on Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, saying AIIMS and a urea factory were set up here because of his efforts."

Within a week of the formation of the Shia Personal Law Board, another Muslim personal law board has been formed: Women have taken the lead and  constituted the All India Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board, protesting against the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s (AIMPLB) inability to address issues related to Muslim women. 
On its part, the Women’s Board has vowed to take up these issues in the right earnest and on the appropriate forum. The president of the newly-constituted Board, Shaista Amber said that even though in Islam women have been granted equal status but the fact was that they have been denied their rights by the ulemas and other Muslim religious leaders. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She charged the AIMPLB with ignoring women issues and said the Muslim women were not fully aware of matters relating to talaq and nikah.
Amber, who is the general secretary of the Nationalist Communist Party and has taken up several social issues pertaining to the depressed sections,  said the Darul Qazas (Islamic courts) constituted by the AIMPLB were lukewarm in their response to Muslim women who petitioned the courts on issues related to divorce and maintenance. She said they were forced to approach the courts as the Law Board had failed to redress their grievances. Citing the example of Hashim of Wazirganj in Lucknow, who was found guilty of raping his daughter, Amber slammed the AIMPLB for failing to take action against the accused.
Amber said the new Board has been constituted specifically for women and will ensure they are given their rights within the framework of Islam. However, if any individual worked against the Islamic law (Shariat) and exploited the women, the Board members will first try to convince him but if he failed to reform himself, then the board will appeal to the muftis to excommunicate him.
 When contacted, executive member of AIMPLB Naseem Iqtidar Ali Khan said that a separate women’s board was not needed as their issues were being dealt with by the AIMPLB."

The All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) has suggested the adoption of a ‘modern nikahnama’ (marriage contract), seeking changes in the terms and conditions of marriage under the Islamic law.
“Our school of thought does not accept talaq just like that. We need evidence of talaq. Just by uttering talaq three times, it cannot be granted,” Shia cleric Maulana Yasub Abba told ANI.

Resonating similar sentiments, Maulana Sadiq, All-India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-president said, “There are many sects in the Muslim religion. Even if husband says ‘talaq’ three lakh times, it won’t be valid. Until both man and woman call for a divorce, action shouldn’t be taken.”
He asserted that the Muslim religion teaches that nothing can be without justice and reasoning.
The AIMPLB had mooted a similar model ‘nikahnama’ in 2003 laying down specific guidelines and conditions on which a marriage can be annulled by both husband and wife and the prescribed format has been prevalent among a large section of Sunni Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.
On September 2, the AIMPLB had told the Supreme Court, which is hearing a PIL by a Muslim woman against the practice of triple talaq, that the scrapping of instantaneous talaq will increase the possibility of husbands killing their estranged wives. It also defended the practice of polygamy."

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to expedite hearing on a PIL to examine the issue whether divorce granted by a Church, set up under its personal law, could be considered valid under the Indian common law.
A bench comprising Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice D Y Chandrachud allowed an interim application moved for early hearing in the case after former Attorney General and senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for petitioner Clarence Pais, sought an urgent hearing.
“The application for early hearing is allowed. Hearing of the appeal is expedited,” the bench said.

Pais, an ex-president of a Catholic association in Karnataka, said when oral ‘triple talaq’ could get legal sanctity for granting divorce to Muslim couples, why could Canon law decrees not be made binding on courts of law.
He had alleged that many Catholic Christians, who married after getting divorce from Christian courts, faced criminal charges of bigamy as such divorces are not recognised by the criminal and civil courts here.
“It is reasonable that when the courts in India recognize dissolution of marriage (by pronouncing the word talaq three times) under Mohammedan Law which is personal law of the Muslims, the courts should also recognise for the purpose of dissolution of marriage Canon Law as the personal law of the Indian Catholics,” the plea had contended.
The plea had contended that Canon Law is the personal law of the Catholics in the country and has to be applied and enforced by a criminal court while deciding a case under section 494 (bigamy) of the IPC.
“This is also applicable for sanction of prosecution considered for alleged bigamy of a Catholic spouse who has married after obtaining a decree for nullity of the first marriage from the Ecclesiastical Tribunal (Christian court),” it said.
The Centre, however, had opposed the plea saying Canon law could not be allowed to override Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and Divorce Act, 1869.
“Since the power for dissolution of marriage has been vested in the court, there is no scope for any other authority including ecclesiastical tribunal to exercise power,” the government had said."

The BJP is moving ahead on plans to build a Ramayana Sangrahalaya, over 25 acres, about 15 km from the disputed site at Ayodhya where the Babri masjid once stood; the museum will be part of the Ramayana circuit which will be developed to attract pilgrims and tourists, it claims. The SP government has announced its own plans to develop an international theme park, the Ramleela park, along the banks of the Sarayu in Ayodhya. Both parties’ disavowals of politics ring insincere.

On the issue of stoking emotive issues and symbols and communal polarisation for electoral gain, the BJP has much to answer for. Ahead of the upcoming elections in UP, attempts are already being made by the party to raise temperatures to get votes. Shiv Sena and BJP hoardings and banners thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and the army for the surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the LoC — and calling for more — have come up in places like Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra and Muzaffarnagar. BJP workers have organised functions to felicitate Parrikar that have featured unabashedly war-like rhetoric. In this climate, the PM’s decision to join the Dussehra celebrations in Lucknow seemed politically loaded and the BJP-led Centre’s attempt to revive the debate on the issue of triple talaq is viewed by a large section of the minority community as a ploy to consolidate the party’s Hindu vote bank in UP. In this moment, the planned Ramayana Sangrahalaya has already provoked party hardliners to dismiss it as a “lollipop”, meant to deflect the real demand for a Ram temple at Ayodhya. But if the BJP invites suspicions of bad faith with its proposed museum in the temple city, the announcement of the Ramleela theme park shows the SP as welcoming — rather than wary — of the possible return of the Ram temple as an issue in the UP polls.
Both BJP and SP must acknowledge that at stake in the way they frame their campaign is the future of the state. Will UP go back to the identity-based jostling between parties of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s? Or will it build on the large and comprehensive verdicts of the assembly elections of 2012 and the Lok Sabha polls of 2014, in which traditional vote banks and faultlines were overtaken by a coming together, the recognition of a shared hope for change? As ruling parties at the Centre and in the state, the BJP and SP cannot afford to evade these questions."

There is a good deal of misunderstanding about the subject itself, which is aggravated by the language of Article 44 of the Constitution. Most people believe that we do not have common civil laws in this country. The reality is, all civil laws are common, except one law, namely the personal law which varies with the religious groups. The personal law relates to marriage, divorce, succession and inheritance, maintenance, custody of children and adoption. By tradition, the personal law is treated as religious, though religion has nothing to do with it. It is interesting to note that the Hindus, who are clamouring for the common civil law, had themselves, led by iconic leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, claimed that the Hindu personal law was a religious law and had warned the then British regime not to interfere with it, when the minimum marriageable age of the female was sought to be raised from 10 to 12 years by a bill tabled by on January 9, 1891 by Sir Andrew Scoble in the then imperial legislature.
No wonder, therefore, that when a small section of Hindus and of Hindus alone, is insisting today on a common civil code that is common personal law, the minorities, and particularly the Muslims, are raising the bogey of interference in their religious affairs.
It is therefore first necessary to correct or to read correctly, the language of Article 44, to mean that the direction is to secure a uniform “personal” law. Second, it must be borne in mind that Chapter IV of the Constitution which contains Article 44, is a chapter on Directive Principles of the Constitution. There are other more vitally important and crucial directive principles contained in the chapter which need to be implemented in the interests of all sections of the people and of the nation as a whole. But the Hindu fundamentalists do not even take cognisance of them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The insistence of the Hindu bigots on uniform personal law is not borne out of any principles or values. This is not to deny the desirability of a uniform personal law consistent with human rights and the principles of equality, fairness and justice. In fact, these norms have to be observed in all human transactions in any civilized society. The question is of the appropriate method to be adopted for enacting the law. The subject being sensitive and almost certain to give opportunity to the religious diehards to raise communal controversies and create clashes, is it the proper time to secure such law? What is the urgency of the law? Which national interests are in danger for want of the law? Which aspect of progress or development is threatened, obstructed or impaired but for the law? Whose welfare is to be secured by the law?
Those clamouring for the law, are not concerned with the welfare of the minorities or any section of them. Their only concern is, the permission given to Muslim men to marry four women by their personal law as practised in this country. They fear that on that account, the Muslim population in the country may soon outstrip the majority community. If therefore only that licence given to the Muslims is withdrawn, they will have no longer any interest in agitating for common personal law. It is also on this account that they have started preaching that their Hindu brethren should have as many children as they can — a preaching which is contrary to the norm of two children laid down by the family planning programme of the national and state governments, from the inception. That also bares their hypocritical tears shed for the plight of Muslim women. In fact, one of their icons, V. D. Savarkar had advocated killing of Muslim women rather than men, since they give birth to Muslims. According to him, the killing of one Muslim woman was equivalent to the killing of 10 Muslim men.
We may ponder on the reality considering all these aspects. First, the bugbear of more Muslim population on account of the licence to marry four women. Statistics show that the percentage of Muslims marrying more than one woman is sharply dwindling throughout the country on account of various factors including poverty, spread of education both among men and women, increasing exposure to a more modern life-style, desire for improved standard of living, decreasing means of livelihood, unemployment etc. Secondly, the ratio of females to males born is the same for all communities in the country, and the said ratio shows 986 females to 1,000 males. Muslim women are not “surplus”, that Muslim males may marry more than one woman. Most critically, Muslim women are not dumb victims or spectators, as they might have been in the past. The Prophet had permitted men to marry more than one woman (but not more than four women) at that time, only because on account of the constant internecine wars, the population of men had dwindled frightfully and the number of widows and unmarried girls had risen abnormally. That decades later, even when normalcy was restored, the selfish male gender continued to use this permission as a right is another matter. But even then, who could really afford the luxury of marrying more than one women and which women would enter wedlock knowing fully well that they had to contend with co-wife or wives? The justification for permission to marry more women, was that the unmarried women and widows should not be left to their fate. But do the Hindu bigots know or do they conveniently forget that till the year 1955, the Hindus had a right to marry and many of them married, unlimited number of women, not merely four?
The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which for the first time restricted the Hindu to marrying only one women, has even now, in some parts of the country, not prevented polygamous marriages. Let us also remember that the illegitimate progeny of men, whichever the religion they may belong to, has been thriving all the same, and proportionately, within Hindu faith, more than of the others.
Child marriages, the absence of basic rights for deserted and divorced women and the status of fatherless and abandoned children among all religious communities — including the prohibition of widow remarriage among vast sections of the Hindus even today — is the burdensome baggage of human hardships that this country has to bear in the 21st century. What is the burden, each religious community shares in this human misery? Does not the majority community share it more, in proportion, given its numbers?
The Hindu bigots’ logic in this respect is self-defeating. Assuming that all or some Muslims marry four, or more than one woman, if they were not to marry more than one woman, in any case the other women would be married to other men. Would that prevent an increase in the Muslim population? On the other hand, the increase would be more. More than one woman sharing the intimacy with one man, would certainly lead to less births than when each woman has a separate spouse. Does not the Muslim law therefore act in its own way as a measure of controlling the population? Not that the law intended to control the population as such or that it should be commended on that account. The question is posed only to expose the hollowness of the fear raised by the Hindu supremacists.
Coming now to the triple talaq practised by Indian Muslims. There is no doubt it is not consistent with either morality, rationality or human rights, and needs to be done away with as early as possible. It is also not sanctioned by the Koran. Many Muslim countries have modified the provisions of the personal law prohibiting bigamy and divorce by voicing talaq, talaq, talaq. No doubt, Muslim women also have a similar right which is known as khulla; this practice comes with restrictions, and in an overall situation dominated by patriarchy, it is as good as ineffective. It is, however, not the plight of Muslim women, resultant on the exercise by men of their so called right to triple talaq, that pains the Hindu extremists agitating for common personal law. They are least concerned with their misery. On the other hand, following the teachings of their mentor, they are their first target, since they give birth to Muslims. They are using the triple talaq only as a ruse in support of their demand.
It further appears that they are under an impression that the uniform personal law means applying Hindu personal law for all religious communities. There is no doubt that all personal laws have to be just and equitable to both men and women and, hence, the good from all personal laws has to be accepted and the bad to be discarded. Hence the uniform code, if and when enacted, will have to be a different one from the personal laws of all religious communities. It will have to be framed by consensus among all the religious groups and will have to conform to the norms of modern values of freedom, equality, rationality, justice and humanism, for both men and women. A deeper reading of all personal laws will reveal that each of them contains some good and equitable provisions, which are worth incorporating in an ideal code.
It is true that if a rational common personal law is enacted, it will help eradicate many evil, unjust and irrational practices prevalent across the communities, and will also strengthen the unity and integrity of the country. However, it is wrong to assume that the process of integration is thwarted for want of such law. Such simplistic assumptions may be good propaganda material in the hands of the fascist religious forces, but is a harmful method of achieving unity. Apart from being counter-productive, it may divert our attention from the crucial socio-economic and political causes which need to be attended to, to achieve the integration of the communities."

Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday described the contentious issue of triple talaq as “not religious, but one related to comprehensive social reforms” which were the “need of the hour”. He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision to replace the existing National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) with the proposed National Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (NCSEBC) and arming the new body with Constitutional status which will benefit Muslims too. Naqvi’s remarks came a day after Modi made a strong pitch against triple talaq, insisting that “exploitation” of Muslim women should end and justice should be meted out to them.
At the BJP’s national executive meet in Bhubaneswar on sunday, the prime minister had also said the new commission will benefit all the backward communities, including Muslims. “Triple talaq is not a religious issue. It’s related to social reforms. Comprehensive social reforms are the need of the hour,” Naqvi, the Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs, said.
Addressing a BJP workers’ convention earlier in the day in Rampur, he said the decision to replace the old commission with the new one will ensure that a large section of Muslims became a part of the “journey towards social justice”. “This will fulfil the long-pending demand of social justice to the backward classes by the BJP-led government,” Naqvi said, adding that the “historic” decision will ensure justice to all the sections of the society.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP leader reiterated that a bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, during the recently-concluded Budget Session of Parliament, granting Constitutional status to the commission. However, opposition parties, including the Congress, SP, BSP, TMC, Left parties and JD(U), blocked the passage of the bill in the Rajya Sabha, he alleged. Naqvi recalled that it was the Parliamentary Committee on Welfare of OBCs which had recommended strengthening the commission and MPs from all the parties had “personally” requested Modi to amend the Constitution for the purpose.
Even after that, the opposition parties resisted the move in the Upper House, he said, terming it as “unfortunate”. “The behaviour of these parties in the Rajya Sabha has exposed their mindset towards the backward classes,” Naqvi alleged. He said giving Constitutional status to NCSEBC will make it a “powerful” body like the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.
The NCBC was a “simple legal body”, whose job was to advise the government on inclusion into or removal from the lists of castes or communities, said Naqvi. The NCSEBC, on the other hand, will discharge functions related to protection, welfare and development of the backward classes."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar)
“The times they are a-changin’” sang Bob Dylan many years ago. But, unfortunately, hundreds of Indian Muslim women, who have been victims of the instant triple talaq practice, seem to be caught in a time warp controlled and dominated by an anti-progressive patriarchal society. It is truly shocking that an abhorrent practice like triple talaq, which has been banned in many countries, still finds support in India. Islamic scholars and women’s organisations have held that the practice has no religious or Quranic sanction and yet the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is opposing any attempt at reform as an interference in religious matters. Irrespective of whether the AIMPLB has a huge following among the Muslim community or not, such bodies should be at the forefront of championing the cause of vulnerable sections like women, instead of allowing them to be exploited using retrograde and arbitrary practices like triple talaq.
Apparently, the advocates of triple talaq are using specious arguments to perpetuate the anachronistic practice unconcerned by the havoc it is causing in the lives of its victims, even as some of them knocked at the doors of the judiciary for relief. In the name of plurality or diversity, how could Indian Muslim women be denied equal status and dignity available to them under the Constitution?
Why should Indian Muslim women be denied their fundamental rights in a secular country like India when several Islamic countries have abolished triple talaq and polygamy? How could such draconian practices be allowed in India when matrimonial laws in Islamic countries were regulated and not considered contrary to Sharia? Here, I would like to recall that my colleague, Arun Jaitley, had earlier asserted that personal laws could not propagate discrimination and allow compromise with human dignity and that religion cannot dictate upon the rights of individuals. It should also be noted that successive governments have amended personal laws of Hindus and Christians in tune with the demands of the changing times and false propaganda is being propounded that a particular religion is being targeted.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) also termed triple talaq as an un-Quranic practice and has stressed that it needed to be abolished by law. In a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November last year, the co-founders of BMMA, Noorjehan Safia Niaz and Zakia Soman, have mentioned that they had just published national research with a primary sample of 4,710 Muslim women across 10 states in which 92.1 per cent of women wanted a total ban on oral/unilateral divorce and 91.7 per cent were opposed to polygamy.
In an article written for a news portal, the duo has argued: “Triple talaq, happens not because of religion but, patriarchy and power play masquerading as religion. It is important that ordinary Muslim women and men are educated about the Quranic principles of justice and fairness concerning divorce. It is important that everybody learns about triple talaq being un-Quranic. Only then can these false notions manufactured by the conservative patriarchal bodies be exposed for what they are — un-Quranic and unjustified.”
Noted expert on Muslim Law, Tahir Mahmood, has also come out in favour of banning triple talaq. In a foreword written by him to the report published on talaq by the BMMA, while referring to the Islamic law of divorce, he said: “In its original unadulterated form it indeed was rational, realistic and modern but has by efflux of time been awfully distorted beyond recognition. There is nothing in the law of Islam suggesting that the husband is free to exercise the power of talaq in an arbitrary and irrational manner. But this is exactly what Muslim men in our times are doing”.

It has also been reported that more than 50,000 Indian women and men have signed a petition spearheaded by the BMMA seeking a total ban on triple talaq.
Here, I would emphasise that Article 14 and Article 15 are crucial and important features of the Indian Constitution. They embody the core values of India’s democracy. Article 14 provides equality before law. It states: “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India”, while Article 15 states : “The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them”. It should be noted that any practice that leaves women socially, financially or emotionally vulnerable is incompatible with the letter and spirit of Articles 14 and 15.
As mentioned earlier, when several countries have reformed the personal laws, it is fallacious to argue that the courts have no jurisdiction to decide on them. The incredible justification advanced by the so-called guardians of the rights of Muslims in the name of religious freedom is a clear denigration of not only Muslim women, but women at large and humanity.
These defenders of inequality and exploitation of women have publicly declared that neither the Supreme Court nor the Indian Constitution has any jurisdiction in coming to the rescue of such hapless women on the ground that triple talaq is derived from the Sharia. If the Sharia is so immutable, why did several Muslim countries come out with modern laws seeking to protect women from such exploitation?
To say that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to decide on such matters is simply unacceptable. Any verdict or direction by the highest court of the land is binding on everybody irrespective of religion, region, sex and caste and nobody should talk in any manner that undermines the dignity of the judiciary. It is unfortunate that some political parties, in their quest to safeguard their vote banks, did not even think once before brazenly supporting such regressive, retrograde and anti-women practices.
No doubt, reform should come from within the religious community. That was why Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Dayanand Saraswati and others reformed Hindu religious practices. Over the years, Hindu religious practices have undergone substantial change and reform.
So, what is the way forward? The only way forward is to discuss and prevent continued exploitation of women by taking necessary measures wherever required. That is what the Law Commission of India is seized of and has sought opinions from stakeholders and the public. The Commission in its questionnaire not on ly referred to the practice of triple talaq but also to the right of inheritance of Hindu women and Maitri Karar, being practised in Gujarat. So how could anybody allege that the exercise targets only one religion? An attempt is also being made to create confusion among people by linking up the issue of triple talaq with that of the Uniform Civil Code. The main issue as regards triple talaq is to end gender discrimination and ensure gender justice and equal rights.
Let there be a wider debate on this critical issue. Distorting scriptures and defending exploitation of women in the guise of celebrating diversity should be stopped forthwith. The need of the hour is to collectively address this issue. It goes without saying that all social, cultural and religious practices that do not stand the scrutiny of the law of equality should change. That is the only way India could transform into a modern, prosperous nation."

(Representational image)
The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the practices of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy impact the social status and dignity of Muslim women and deny them fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
In a fresh written submission filed before the apex court, the government has reiterated its earlier stand and said these practices render Muslim women “unequal and vulnerable” as compared to men of their community as well as women belonging to other communities.

“The practices which are under challenge, namely, triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy are practices which impact the social status and dignity of Muslim women and render them unequal and vulnerable qua men belonging to their own community, women belonging to other communities and also Muslim women outside India,” the Centre said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“There are unreasonable classifications which arise from practices such as those under challenge in the present petition, which deny to Muslim women the full enjoyment of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution,” it said.
The apex court had on March 30 observed that practices of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims were important issues involving “sentiments” and a Constitution bench would hear the pleas challenging these from May 11. The Centre, in its written submission, has termed these practices as “patriarchal values and traditional notions about the role of women in society” and said that “the right of a woman to human dignity, social esteem and self-worth are vital facets of her Right to Life under Article 21”.
“Gender inequity has ripple effect on the rest of the community, preventing it from partaking in full, liberties guaranteed by a modern Constitution,” it said. Seeking to declare these practices as unconstitutional, the government has said reforms in Muslim personal law have not taken place for over six decades in the past and Muslim women, who comprises eight per cent of the population, have remained “extremely vulnerable” due to fear of instant divorce.
“Even though it may be true to say that only some women are directly and actually affected by triple talaq and polygamy, the fact remains that every woman who is subject to the said law lives under threat, fear or prospect of these practices being invoked against her, which in turn impacts her status, her choices, her conduct and her right to life with dignity,” the Centre has said.
It has also raised a fundamental issue and said in a secular democracy, whether religion can be a reason to deny equal status and dignity, which is available to women under the Constitution. “The conferment of a social status based on patriarchal values or one that is at the mercy of menfolk is incompatible with the letter and spirit of Articles 14 and 15,” it said.
“Practices such as polygamy cannot be described as being sanctioned by religion in as much as historically, polygamy prevailed across communities for several centuries including the ancient Greeks and Romans, Hindus, Jews and Zoroastrians. It had less to do with religion and more to do with social norms at the time,” the submission said. Influential Muslim organisations like the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have opposed the court’s adjudication of these matters, maintaining these practices stemmed from the Holy Quran and were not justiciable.
Several Muslim women have challenged the practice of ‘triple talaq’ in which the husband, quite often, pronounces talaq thrice in one go, sometimes over phone or text message. ‘Nikah halala’ is a practice intended to curb incidence of divorce under which a man cannot remarry his former wife without her having to go through the process of marrying someone else, consummating it, getting divorced, observing the separation period called ‘Iddat’ and then coming back to him again.
The apex court had earlier said it would decide issues pertaining to the legal aspects of the practices of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims but would not deal with the question whether divorce under Muslim law needs to be supervised by courts as it falls under the legislative domain.
The Centre had on October 7 last year opposed in the apex court the practice of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The AIMPLB had told the court that pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.
The apex court had taken suo motu cognizance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in the event of divorce or due to other marriages of their husband."

The Chairman of State Minorities Commission serving Andhra Pradesh and Telangana sees the Law Commission’s questionnaire asking the public for responses on the Uniform Civil Code and ‘triple talaq’ as an “attempt by the government to brand Muslims as anti-nationals”.
“The government is trying to create a sort of atmosphere where the Muslim community gets agitated and does something which is not desirable and, in turn, they are branded as anti-nationals…those who do not follow the Constitution of India and all that,” Abid Rasool Khan said.

“The community is falling into the trap of the right-wing elements and agencies who are working in tandem,” he alleged. Khan described the exercise of asking for opinions without the government putting a draft of the Uniform Civil Code in the public domain as “very absurd and not heard of”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“You are not telling other religions how are you going to alter their rights, you are not touching the other communities. Ministers on TV do not talk about the HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) taxation benefits. All these things make me weary that there is a hidden agenda behind the questionnaire,” he told PTI.
Stating that every 200 sq.km, one can see a different culture in India, Khan said the questionnaire should have had a minimum of 500-600 questions. “In 16 questions, you are trying to do it. So, what the government is basically doing is framing a policy to show the Muslims as anti-national and unpatriotic…who do not follow the Constitution and democratic principles. I strongly object to this,” he said.
Khan requested the Law Commission to withdraw the questionnaire, adding that the government should first put a draft of the Uniform Civil Code “they are talking and threatening about” in the public domain and give “ample time” to all the communities.
He noted that the questionnaire did not “talk about the Sikh community, the Kodagu community in Uttar Pradesh which allows five husbands to a woman, which is common in most of the villages in the hill areas of the state and Nagaland where the wife can be changed with a small gift given to her”.
“The way it is being handled, it is just a poll publicity tool before the Uttar Pradesh election and then it will sink in a boat,” Khan said and termed the exercise a “political gimmick”.
He said Muslims would resolve issues such as ‘triple talaq’ and polygamy “within the community” and they are “on the verge” of doing so. “Why are others so worried about it? Is there no other issue like child marriage? No issue like polygamy exits in the Hindu community?” he asked.
Khan claimed that even a BJP woman MP was a “polygamist”. “So, why are they not looking into their own closet before looking at Muslims and creating a scene where we (Muslims) are shown as wild, uncivilised and all that,” he said."

The Muslim Personal Law Board can               only interpret within the precincts of the shariat. The recommendation               to avoid triple talaq is in the right direction as it brings it               more in line with other schools of Islamic thought as in Saudi Arabia.               The marriage ends with either single talaq or triple talaq, except               that a single talaq can be revoked within 3 months and thus protects               the man and woman from a talaq pronounced in anger and leaves the               door open for reconciliation. While the AIMPLB has moved slowly               in this regard in reforming Muslim personal laws, it is a step in               the right direction.

A seminar on refugees of Balochistan and Kashmir, which was scheduled to have Tarek Fatah among the speakers, was cancelled abruptly, the organisers alleged on Thursday. Swadhikar Bangla Foundation had planned the seminar, ‘Sufferings of People of Kashmir and Balochistan and What the World Wants to Know’, at Calcutta Club on January 7. The foundation said the club cancelled the seminar after officials shared apprehensions of “further problems in the city”.
The police and the government denied any role in the cancellation, stating that it was the club’s administrative decision.
In an email from the club, the organisers were told that the cancellation was due to “unavoidable circumstances” and that the club wanted to “ensure a cordial atmosphere” on its premises. But Calcutta Club president Wg Cdr (retd) K K Biswas refused to elaborate what these circumstances were. “This is very unfortunate. The club would not like to comment,” he told The Indian Express.
Watch What Else Is Making Newshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Fatah, an author and commentator, told The Indian Express, “What I have learnt is that the police cancelled the event and specifically mentioned my name. They said I was anti-Pakistan and hence the Muslim population in Kolkata would have a problem with me. I am flabbergasted if this is true. The only conclusion to draw from this is that the Islamists who support Mamata Banerjee are pro-Pakistan, otherwise why would there be communal disharmony.” He alleged that Calcutta Club had initially pressured the organisers to delete the word ‘Kashmir’ from the posters and cancelled his stay at the club.
Swadhikar Bangla Foundation was registered as a private incorporation with the Registrar of Companies in Kolkata on October 19, 2016. The group’s founder chairman, Colonel (retd) Diptanshu Chowdhury, is a Kargil veteran and BJP leader who contested from Asansol South in the 2016 state polls and finished third. The organisation organised a symposium on triple talaq in December, where the speakers included BJP leaders Sambit Patra and Dilip Ghosh.
Chowdhury said, “Suddenly, the club told us to omit the name of Kashmir from the programme and not to call two speakers known for their anti-Pakistan statements. We said it is not possible, following which the club informed us that the police were not willing to give us permission, apprehending problems in the city.”
He added, “The club committee officially declined to host this unique event. This discreetly violates the fundamental rights of citizens of Kolkata to exchange views on Kashmir and Balochistan, the two issues raised by PM Narendra Modi. We see clear interference of Kolkata Police.”
A senior Trinamool leader denied that the government had any role in the cancellation of the seminar, and alleged that the BJP “was intentionally trying to create communal strife in the state”. “The event has been organised by the BJP under a different banner with the ultimate aim of trying to spread tension,” he alleged.
Vinit Goel, Additional Commissioner of Police, said, “The club wanted permission and later informed us they had cancelled the programme. There was no question of Kolkata Police denying permission.”
A member of Calcutta Club said, “It was communicated to us by the government that it was felt that the event could potentially cause unnecessary tension. This was done through unofficial channels.”"

Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said Sunday that the issue of triple talaq was not a religious one, but a matter of the Muslim women’s right to equality and the right to live with dignity. “Triple talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in the Sharia law. So, why this discrimination towards women? I appeal to all political parties to not politicise this issue. I urge them to put an end to negative politics,’’ Naidu said in Hyderabad. “This nation cannot tolerate negative politics and the results of recent elections have amply shown that. There should be constructive and positive politics,’’ he said.
Naidu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging the Muslim community to introspect on the triple talaq issue, and was not interested in deriving political mileage. “The Congress has kept silent for all these years even though they claim to be champions of the minority community,’’ Naidu said. “Why has the Congress kept silent… they should answer,’’ he added.
Speaking on the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, which comes into force from May 1, Naidu, who holds the portfolios of Information and Broadcasting, Urban Development and Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, said, “The Real Estate Act coming into force after a nine-year wait marks the beginning of a new era in which a buyer is the king while developers benefit from the confidence of the king…. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal interest in the matter made the Act a reality.”
He added, “The Act ushers in the much desired accountability, transparency and efficiency in the sector by defining the rights and obligations of both the buyers and developers. This important legislation gained momentum under this government and could finally see the light of the day.”"

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has, in its draft National Policy for Women 2016, proposed a review of all personal laws so as to remedy their inherent gender bias.
[related-post]
“Given the patriarchal constructs of the personals laws, a review will be undertaken of the personal and customary laws in accordance with the constitutional provisions to enable equitable and uniform entitlements for women irrespective of their caste, community or religion,” states the soon-to-be-released draft policy.
The draft policy is a revision of the ministry’s existing 2001 policy to bring it up-to-date with issues and debates that have emerged over the last 15 years. Ministry officials said that the new policy marks a shift from a welfare-oriented approach to a rights-based approach towards women’s empowerment. “It has incorporated some of the suggestions of the high-level Pam Rajput report,” said an official.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The government-commissioned Pam Rajput report had noted that many of the discriminatory provisions in personal laws undermined the position of women and had recommended detailed changes in Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Parsi laws.
The report, though submitted to the ministry in June 2015, has remained unreleased and unimplemented till date. It was only recently that the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by Shayara Banu against “triple talaq”, directed the ministry to produce the report before it.
Some other areas that the draft policy proposes to examine include re-looking at the contentious issue of criminalisation of marital rape within the framework of human rights, ensuring the rights of marginalised sex workers and the transgender community in view of the landmark Supreme Court judgment that recognises the third gender.
It proposes to recognise the validity of prenuptial agreements from the perspective of ensuring a divorced woman’s right to maintenance, property and child custody.
With the intent of reducing unpaid care work, the burden of which mostly falls on women, the draft calls for redistributing gender roles by providing ‘dependent care paid leave’ for all employees whether men or women. It also looks at new forms of sexual abuse such as cyber-crimes and harassment through mobiles.

A Muslim women’s body has said that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) should not act like a kangaroo court and has no right to impose its decisions on issues like ‘triple talaq’.
The comments by All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) President Shaista Amber came as the Yogi Adityanath led Uttar Pradesh government initiated the process of eliciting the views of Muslim women on the ‘triple talaq’ mode of divorce.
“The AIMPLB should not act like khap panchayat (kangaroo court). They have no right to force their decisions or recommendations on anyone. It is the decision of the court and Parliament, which is finally accepted,” Amber said today.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Moreover, in the name of defending the law, three months counselling period mentioned in the Sharia (Islamic law) cannot be overlooked, she added.
Amber, had on Thursday attended a meeting called by Uttar Pradesh Women and Family Welfare minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi to elicit the views of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq.
The state government intends to place these views before the Supreme Court.
“The Constitution has given the right to equality to all…triple talaq is most unfortunate for Muslim women and the UP government, on the basis of their (Muslim women) opinion, will place its view before the Supreme Court,” Baghuguna said.
Bahuguna said that equality in education, security as well as social equality are not just the but also a necessity for every woman.
She said there are several Muslim countries where triple talaq has been done away with adding that the Supreme Court was deliberating on the issue and the UP government will place its views before the apex court based on the opinion of Muslim women.
Those who participated in the meeting called by Bahuguna are learnt to have opined that the option of social boycott of those indulging in triple talaq in an arbitrary manner, as recommended by the AIMPLB, will not help in discouraging the practice.
The AIMPLB had earlier adopted a resolution saying that those who give talaq without Sharia reasons will face social boycott.
It had asserted that Muslims have a “constitutional” right to follow their personal law including the triple talaq mode of divorce."

As many as four TMC senior leaders – three MPs and one MLA, Sultan Ahmed, Idris Ali, Ahmed Hassan Imran and Siddiqullah Chowdhury – were present at a public meeting organised by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Sunday opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempt to implement a uniform civil code. Park Circus Maidan was filled to capacity, with the crowd even spilling onto roads, obstructing traffic at the seven-point crossing and adjoining areas for hours. Addressing the gathering, Chowdhury, a Cabinet minister, condemned PM Narendra Modi’s attempt to implement UCC.
Watch what else is making news:

“In a recent core committee meeting, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had told me that it was not possible to implement UCC in West Bengal,” he said. Sultan Ahmed said the “wave of protest” witnessed in Kolkata would soon spread across the country, protesting against the “misrule” of the Centre.
Earlier in the day, after the 25th general meeting of the AIMPLB, Zafaryab Jilani, its secretary, had said the Modi government’s decision was aimed towards gaining political dividend in the upcoming UP Assembly elections. “Most of the electoral promises of the government before coming to power, had remained unfulfilled. So, in order to divert public attention from the burning issues at hand, Modi is raising such topics. It is a Modi vs secularism issue. They are following their political manifesto of implementation of UCC and are trying to interfere with Muslim personal law,” added Jilani.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said it was a simplification of separation of a married couple instead of dragging the matter for years through painful litigation. “Three months after talaq, the woman is free to lead a normal life and even get married without any question being raised,” Jilani said.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Jilani, on being asked whether he supported the system of triple talaq over phone or via WhatsApp, said, “The idea is to deliver the message. There is no harm if it is done over the phone or WhatsApp. It is not necessary for both wife and the husband to be physically present at the spot.”"

Pune-based Dr Razia Patel, who was part of a high-level committee that recommended a complete ban on oral, unilateral and triple talaq (divorce), said that a bleak picture persists on the overall status of Muslim women in the country. Among all communities studied, Muslim women are the lowest on labour force participation rate.
Dr Patel was part of the 14-member committee chaired by Dr Pam Rajput, which was appointed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2013 to assess the status of women in the country since 1989 and to evolve policy interventions. The committee, which completed its surveys in 2015, paid special attention to women in marginalised communities. Razia Patel, who is an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Education in Pune, told The Indian Express that the central committee had strongly recommended a complete ban on oral, unilateral and triple talaq. “We have also recommended that justice through courts should be accessible and fast so that women are not required to go to unconstitutional arbitration courts,” she said.
“It makes wives extremely vulnerable and insecure regarding their marital status,” said Patel. These women experience high levels of violence at home and outside, she said. When it comes to customary practices and personal laws, Adivasi, Muslim and Dalit women are far from being equal to their male counterparts and these laws and practices are actively used against them by their community, she added. Muslim women lag behind in almost all key socio-economic indicators of development. They are economically and educationally marginalised, have low social status, experience domestic abuse as well as “communal violence spurred by identity politics”, Patel said.

The report states that Dalit, Muslim, Adivasi, elderly and differently-abled women have low levels of educational attainment. While Adivasi and Dalit women have a relatively large workforce share, Muslim women have the lowest participation rates.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to the 2011 census, the total number of women workers in India is 149.8 million. Though most women make an economic contribution in one form or another, much of it is not documented. Only 25 per cent of women are working, less that half per cent are seeking work and the total women labour force is a mere 25.3 per cent, and there has been a steady decline in the last decade.
Only 15.5 per cent of urban women are in the workforce compared to 30 per cent in rural India. Within this, the share of Muslim women in the workforce is less than 10 per cent, Patel said. According to the 66th round of the National Sample Survey Organisation (2009-10), out of every 1,000 women in the labour force, only 101 were Muslims.

We have strongly recommended the appointment of a Commission on Muslim Women that will map and suggest actions on issues related to them, Patel said. There is a need to review and update current schemes for Muslim women to assess their effectiveness in terms of social indicators apart from introducing special schemes in collaboration with the Mahila Bank and nationalised banks for availability of credit to them, the committee has said. Improve accessibility to girls schools, hostels and implement RTE provisions in letter, review the curriculum to add the latest vocational life skills and make it more friendly and flexible for “migratory communities like Muslims” and monitor healthcare schemes for Muslim women’s participation, are some of the recommendations of the committee. Programmes such as Mahila Samkhya be introduced in areas with high Muslim concentration so that they can develop leadership and socialisation skills among women, apart from the speedy rehabilitation of women in relief camps, have also been recommended."

1 lakh crore fund for safety on tracks
The Centre is planning to create a special fund, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) of Rs 1 lakh crore for critical safety upgrades required on railway tracks. The move follows the Kanpur train accident in November, 2016 in which at least 140 people were killed. There have been calls from railway experts that the government needs to seriously consider the upgradation of tracks to avoid accidents and casualties. For the first time, a separate Rail Budget will not be presented this year. But the Finance Ministry under Arun Jaitley has given Rs 55,000 crore as Gross Budgetary Support, the highest ever allocation to the transporter. Read more

• I appreciate your ‘Search & Siege’ series on Indian Muslims. Muslims in India need to be seen by their ellow Indians not through the terror prism, but as common people facing everyday problems. It is important for non-Muslim Indians to understand, without prejudice. There is insufficient representation of members of the community in the national media, making them almost invisible. Therefore the effort on the part of 
The Indian Express to delve into the lives of Indian Muslims from all sections of society is laudable. 
— Tarana Khan, New Delhihttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
• This refers to Seema Chishti’s ‘Will getting our women to shed purdah end bias?’ (IE, September 6). The socio-economic status of Muslim women should be gauged in the context of the overall status of the Muslim community. As far as the key indicators like literacy and employment are concerned, the Muslim community as a whole lags behind the national average. Yet a fury is worked up against any demand for affirmative action in favour of the Muslim community. The survey conducted by Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon, and mentioned in the report, noted that it is not the Muslim Personal Law or Islam per se that is responsible for the condition of Muslim women. In fact, the study came up with some amazing findings, such as the fact that despite the triple talaq, less than 2 per cent of Muslim women are divorced or deserted. Unfortunately, the media continues to be ignorant or perhaps conveniently overlooks these facts and instead focuses on the negative aspects without proper analysis.
— Huma Hasan, Aligarh
Too independent
• This refers to the editorial, `Ruined in Ranchi’ (IE, September 7). The political crises in Ranchi pose a larger question about the stability of smaller states, or states with smaller assemblies. In recent times we have seen fractured mandates, coalition governments and over-ambitious legislators. This will remain the character of Indian politics in times to come. So to avoid instability, urgent steps need to be taken. I think the independence of the Independents needs to be curbed. No Independent MLA should be allowed to switch sides, or they should be asked to contest again.
— Rajesh Kumar, New Delhi
India Shining?
• Telgi has named powerful politicians in the stamp scandal. But this is nothing surprising. Many people with criminal backgrounds are in politics, joining and forming political parties. Never has a notable politician been found guilty of any major charge. The legal process is too lengthy and evidence against high-profile persons and politicians never finds its way into the courts of law. Is India really shining? 
— Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi
A wrong battle
• C.P. Bhambhri’s ‘The AIIMS I know’ (IE, September 1) exposes the agenda to cripple the AIIMS, the premier health institute of the country. I agree with Bhambhri’s observations on AIIMS. I strongly feel Anbumani Ramadoss needs to be stopped. He seems to be fighting the wrong battles. Bhambhri is absolutely right in saying that it is the duty of alert citizens — and, I add, a sensitive and strong media — to defend prestigious public institutions from political interference.

"1617716959-16","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","uniform civil loophole","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/uniform-civil-loophole/","uniform civil loophole","July 27, 2003","Whenever there has been a debate on the uniform civil code, it has never gone past the preliminary issue of whether the time for such a change has come or not. This has helped the Hindutva camp appropriate the uniform code and strut around as its champion.
The secular camp, on the other hand, has been far too much on the defensive to let the debate advance into the composition of the code. Such an anomaly would not have arisen if the Congress had the sagacity to call the BJP’s bluff. Much of the nationalistic rhetoric surrounding the common code would have blown away if the BJP had been challenged to produce a draft that would deal with the existing gender inequities in the various personal laws.

It is not without reason that though the BJP and its forerunner Jan Sangh have been advocating UCC for decades, they fight shy of spelling out the specifics of what they consider to be a model law on personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and succession.

Look at all the literature churned out by the Sangh Parivar on the uniform civil code. So many reams have been written on why there should be such a code (why should a Muslim have four wives?) but almost nothing on what it should be. The silence has a design.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The specifics would have killed the proposal – or rather its utility as a tool in the hands of the BJP to expose the secular pretensions of the Congress. The specifics would have raised the hackles of a lot of people, including even the BJP’s core constituency of upper castes and middle class.




Four weddings
 To the Sangh Parivar, the best reason to have a common code is to prevent Muslim men marrying four times
HUF and puff
 But a common code will also have to neutralise provisions like Hindu Undivided Family, a sort of legal tax dodge that is anti-women to boot
Mrs Doubtfire
 Under Hindu law a Hindu cannot marry outside the faith. A uniform code will abolish such conservatism



Given the many inequities that have remained in the Hindu personal laws despite the reforms and codification in Jawaharlal Nehru’s reign, the provisions of a uniform civil code would constitute a radical change for the majority community as well. Indeed, they would in various ways undermine the patriarchy that is common to all the personal laws.

The NDA could very well be said to have done the BJP a big favour by ‘‘forcing’’ the BJP to put the uniform civil code issue on the backburner. Unwittingly, the allies have spared the BJP the hard option of delivering on its common code promise – and in the process, reconfiguring the hallowed Hindu way of life.

There can be no uniform civil code without uprooting the status quo in millions of Hindu families across the country. The alternative would have been to attempt no reform and instead pass off Hindu personal laws, with cosmetic changes, as the uniform civil code. But that would have been counter-productive and rendered the BJP all the more vulnerable to the charge of being a communal party.

Atal Behari Vajpayee himself clarified this in a newspaper interview in January 1998, shortly before he took office as prime minister. ‘‘There is no question of imposing Hindu laws over other communities,’’ Vajpayee said, at a stage when the BJP was yet to ‘‘sacrifice’’ its uniform civil code demand at the altar of the NDA coalition.

The formula Vajpayee disclosed then bears scrutiny following the Supreme Court’s latest reminder to the government of its constitutional obligation to enact a uniform civil code. Vajpayee’s statement of 1998 was probably the last authoritative pronouncement from the BJP before it put the common civil code on hold.

Having ruled out the possibility of it being only a repackaged Hindu law packaged as UCC, Vajpayee had said, ‘‘There will be a new code, based on gender equality and comprising the best elements in all the personal laws.’’ For good measure he had added, ‘‘Certain Hindu laws also need to be amended.’’

 But that’s easier said than done. Here’s a quick look at the kind of drastic deviations the government would have to think of making from the Hindu system to bring about a common code in the country.

Marriage and divorce: In this area, the easy part from the Hindu point of view is to insist on monogamy and banning the option a Muslim husband has of instant divorce (triple talaq). What will however be harder to sell to Hindus, especially the conservative elements among them, is the idea of doing away with the requirement of the spouse being from the same religion.

Currently, a Hindu cannot marry under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, unless the spouse is also a Hindu or converts to Hinduism. This restriction is obviously meant to discourage Hindus from marrying outside the community.

Those who still wish to marry non-Hindus take recourse to the Special Marriage Act, a secular enactment which provides for a ‘‘civil’’ marriage. Since UCC is also, by definition, meant to be a secular enactment, it cannot impose any restriction on inter-religion marriages.

It is equally uncertain whether Hindus will agree to borrowing from the Special Marriage Act the provision of making registration of marriage compulsory. In fact, a marriage is said to be solemnised under that Act only when the man and woman sign their declarations of eligibility before a registrar.

One of the conditions of eligibility is that the man is above 21 years and the woman is above 18. If such a declaration is made an essential part of marriage under UCC, it will have the salutary effect of serving as a check on child marriages, which have a disturbingly high prevalence especially in the countryside. No marriage will then be solemnised – and therefore valid – until and unless the age requirement is fulfilled.

Succession and inheritance: Given its financial implications, this area throws up an even more intractable problem. If a uniform civil code is to remove gender inequities, it will have to abolish a legal institution peculiar to Hindus, the Hindu undivided family (HUF).

But the very idea of abolishing it is bound to provoke an uproar among Hindus because millions of businesses are run and agricultural properties are owned by HUFs. This is because HUF is treated as a separate entity under the income tax law, thereby reducing the liability of individual family members.

The justification for HUF is deeply patriarchal. HUF is designed to ensure that the properties remain with the male descendants of the family. If it is not abolished, HUF will have to be extended to other communities. In which case, UCC will end up making things worse for women across the board.

This retrograde concept of HUF is based on what is called the Hindu co-parcenary system. Women are never part of the co-parcenary and the Supreme Court recently ruled that even if no male member is left in a family, a female member cannot become karta or in-charge of the ancestral property.

Since the Hindu personal law does not give a woman a right to partition, the ancestral or joint family properties remain undivided and she will never get any share. The situation is no better when it comes to a woman’s right to the self-acquired properties of her father, for instance. The Hindu Succession Act 1956 places no fetters on the extent to which a man can bequeath his properties. It is only if he dies intestate (without a will) that his daughter will have a right to equal share as his son.

Among Muslims, there is no distinction between a joint family property and self-acquired property. The Muslim law also puts a cap of two thirds of the property on the extent to which somebody can bequeath by will. The rest will have to be left for his immediate family in which the daughter has a right to half the share of the son’s. Thus, in regard to succession and inheritance, Muslim women are in some respects better than their Hindu counterparts.

Clearly, UCC has little chance of being enacted except in the very unlikely event of Hindu men voluntarily giving up their gender privileges. Till then India is only going to be every now and then treated to a sterile and repetitive debate on a uniform civil code.


NO Politics is so vitiated that the demand for a uniform civil code sounds hollow

‘I cannot trust my political masters’

SYEDA HAMEED
WHAT does this past week’s observation by the Supreme Court on the desirability of Parliament framing a common civil code in the interest of national integration mean to me as a citizen of India, a Muslim and a woman?

Twenty years ago, all of us in the women’s movement, regardless of religion, backed a uniform civil code. During the Shah Bano case, we saw an opportunity for securing rights for Muslim women — those rights which were enjoined for them in the Koran.

We questioned the fact that a Muslim woman was not entitled to the same rights as a Hindu, Christian or Sikh woman simply because of her religion. Why was she denied the paltry maintenance available to others? Under what provision of the Constitution was this discrimination permissible? Shah Bano became a symbol of gender parity and gender empowerment.

But the then government succumbed to the orthodox lobby and enacted the Muslim Women (Right to Protection on Divorce) Act 1986. That was the end of our effort for a secular solution.

Much water has flowed down the Brahamaputra since 1986. Today I cannoy believe the SC is “anguished” Parliament has still not enacted a uniform civil code, it has not express- ed anguish at the steady dismantling of national integration by deliberate polarisation and communalisation of society and the polity.

For me, the bottom line is that I am not prepared to accept a uniform civil code enacted by this government. Why? Have I become retrograde, you may well ask. Have I become a fundamentalist? Communal?

You may also say, ‘‘What kind of an Indian are you? If you live in India you better behave like an Indian.’’

The fact of the matter, if I can address the powers, is that I cannot trust you, my political masters, with framing a common civil code for all of us: Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, tribals. What magic mantra will you chant that reflects all our personal laws?




A uniform civil code can’t alone promote national integration. The politics of religion has to be tackled too



Can I really trust you to propagate what my elders called Ganga-Jamna tehzeeb? Or will you use your patent formula of homogenising humans?

It is not that I don’t hold you in great awe but something has happened to people like me, especially since February 2002. It makes me say, albeit with great respect, that you have lost my ilk and me forever. Because we don’t have faith in your justice since we witnessed the happenings in Gujarat.

We were there when the Naroda Patiya massacre of Muslims took place and the state stood by as idle spectator. We were there in Vadodara when humans were slaughtered in Best Bakery. We were there in Godhra when innocent yatris were set on fire. We were everywhere, counting corpses.

 But whereas those suspected of burning the train, 121 of them, have been charged under POTA, not a single suspect of Naroda Patiya, Best Bakery or Chamanpura has been caught. The murderers saunter and swagger in the streets while the witnesses cower in dread of reprisals.

Until the other day, the CBI was naming the home minister, the HRD minister, the former woman and child welfare minister as complicit in the Babri demolition. Today the case is withdrawn. Just like that, on technical grounds that the common man is not expected to understand.

Who demolished the Babri Masjid? Headless kar sevaks? The leaders, who the ‘‘riff raff’’ have named again and again, are let off the hook. Uniform civil code for national integration? Just some hollow words!

Yes Muslims can’t demand to be treated equally and yet want their own personal law. This is a siege mentality at work

‘The benefits of personal law are a myth’
TARIQ ANSARI
THE Supreme Court has once again set the cat amongst the pigeons on the matter of a Common Civil Code. Gloating and breast-beating has commenced on all sides of the politico-social spectrum. As an Indian Muslim, I would like very much to be heard.

Let’s get some ridiculous myths out of the way first:

l Myth one: all Muslims are opposed to a common civil code.

Clearly this is not the case. I am one who is not, as are many others.

l Myth two: the Muslim Personal Law gives Muslims some great benefits that are being withheld from non-Muslims.

Nothing can be further from the truth. The personal law only gives Muslims the right to be governed by Shariah principles in the personal matters of marriage, inheritance, property rights and religious observance. Commercial and criminal law is the same for all Indians.

So why do I support a common law for all Indians in civil matters? For four very good reasons.

For one, there are at least six (count them, six!) schools of jurisprudence among Muslims, four among Sunnis and two among Shias. The Indian Muslim Personal Law is a curious amalgam of principles from different schools, but most particularly the Hanafi branch of Sunni legal belief. While most Indian Muslims are from this sect, our so-called Muslim Personal Law does not cover large numbers of Muslims, who prefer their own interpretation of Shariah law. Therefore, this is hardly in conformity with pure Koranic practice, as the more extreme elements among the Muslim clergy would have us believe.

Second, I believe the most important demand that Muslims should make in secular India is that we are treated equally. That we have equal rights and opportunities as all other Indians and that the State will afford us the same protection of our rights and property as it would Hindus. I do not believe Muslims can make that demand when at the same time we want to be treated differently in matters of personal law. This is an irreconcilable inconsistency.




At least half of all Muslims are badly served by the Muslim Personal Law. If my daughter marries a Muslim, it will be under the Special Marriages Act



Also, at least half of all Muslims are badly served by the Muslim Personal Law. Triple talaq, no rights to maintenance (thank you, Rajiv Gandhi!) and subordinate rights of inheritance are all examples of how my Muslim sisters labour under an unfair and, dare I say it, unIslamic set of regulations. I have a daughter and if she should want to marry a Muslim it will be under the Special Marriages Act, thank you very much.

Fourth, this ridiculous Muslim Personal Law is a convenient stick for Hindu communalists to beat Muslims with. Giving us the right to be governed by our own personal law gives them the right to claim that we are some kind of privileged minority with a suspect commitment to the Indian republic. Take away the law and deprive Pravin Togadia of the stick.

However, I would also like to raise two very specific and critical qualifications to my support of the Supreme Court mention. We cannot move towards a common civil code without absolute clarity on these matters:

Understand and do something about the fundamental reasons why Indian Muslims cling to their own Personal Law. Deep within the psyche of the Mussalman is a fear of disenfranchisement, of complete loss of identity and marginalisation within Indian society.

 Every time you burn homes in Gujarat, every time you treat Urdu as an alien tongue, every time a Muslim boy loses a job opportunity thanks to discrimination and every time Mr Togadia hints darkly at ‘‘the enemy within’’ you compound the siege mentality.

When everything is taken away, goes the ghetto belief, let us cling tightly to what we are. The Muslim Personal Law, sadly, has become one of the symbols of identity, an identity under threat.

A common civil code must imply that all citizens are covered under the same laws on civil and commercial matters. Let us dismantle at the same time, special privileges under the Hindu Undivided Family provisions, as also any special laws governing the personal affairs of Christians, Parsis, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs as well as other groups like the Nairs of Kerala who follow the principles of matrilineal descent. Do away not only with Muslim Personal Law but also other laws on the statute books that grant legal sanctity to unique practices of the diverse communities of India.

As an Indian Muslim, I wholeheartedly support the idea of a common civil code. It is a fair and equitable Directive Principle of the Constitution of India. Let us, however, understand this matter in its entirety, away from the hysterical jubilation and frantic wailing of communalists on both sides.

One people. One law.

Yes, for sure!

At a time when the country is debating on “triple talaq”, it was exactly 51 years ago on April 18, 1966, that the historic march against the “draconian law” was taken out in Mumbai by social reformer Hamid Dalwai, along with seven Muslim women.
Protesting against triple talaq, polygamy and halala, Dalwai and seven women had marched towards the Mantralaya in Mumbai and handed over their memorandum of demands to then chief minister Vasantrao Naik.
“This was the first march in India against triple talaq and practices like halala and polygamy. Hamid Dalwai fought all odds to organise this march for the rights of Muslim women. The movement against triple talaq now seen in the country has its roots in this revolutionary march,” said Professor (Dr) Shamshuddin Tamboli of Pune, president of the Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal (MSM), founded by Dalwai on March 22, 1970.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To remember the historic incident, MSM will be taking out a march from Dr Ambedkar’s statute to the Pune district collectorate on Tuesday. “Seven Muslim women who are victims of triple talaq will be participating in this march and will submit a representation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis,” said Tamboli, who has done his doctoral research on the life of Hamid Dalwai.
Sadiya Khan, a 20-year-old Muslim woman from Kasba Peth in Pune, who was given triple talaq on WhatsApp by her husband in July 2016, said that she would be participating in the MSM march against the “draconian law”.
Sadiya said she had filed a criminal case against her husband at the Kondhwa police station for the harassment done to her. “I will fight till I get justice. Triple talaq practice should end,” she said.
Meanwhile, Tamboli said, “Inspired by the work of legendary social reformers Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule, Dalwai worked for the rights of Muslim women. He started an organisation Sada-e-Nisvan in 1965, which took the historic march to Mantralaya. In 1970, he started the MSM….He held meetings of triple talaq victims. To counter this, some religious fanatics organised rallies of thousands of Muslim women against Dalwai. These fanatics formed the All India Muslim Personal Law Protection Committee in 1971. And, in 1973, it was registered as the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the same body which said on Sunday that triple talaq is wrong but is still a valid way to end marriage…..Board says that Muslims who misuse triple talaq would face social boycott from the community. We feel social boycott is not a good practice. It is against our constitution. Putting a ban on triple talaq practice is needed. But only ban is not enough. We want the government to come up with a law that will make triple talaq practice a punishable offence.”
“We support the stand taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Central government against triple talaq. The government should also work towards the implementation of Uniform Civil Code in the country,” he added."

Painting and dancing which she loved were not allowed, so she found creative expression by writing poetry. She rebelled against wearing a burqa to college and asked why prayers had to be said in Arabic, why not in Urdu. After marriage to a Muslim who happened to be a leftist, she was under no compulsion to practise traditional  religion. In the ’70s and ’80s she saw cousins in poor families being married off to elderly men in the Gulf, and women (including a sister) being threatened with talaq for trifling disobedience. In the ’90s she did a survey with another researcher (a Hindu) for a women’s studies unit in which they interviewed about 500 women in Hyderabad on what they felt about Muslim personal law. The majority wanted changes in the polygamy and triple talaq provisions but were too afraid to say ‘change the personal law’. When she presented these findings she was branded a BJP agent. Women’s groups, she says, should not have abandoned their campaign for a gender-just civil code. She remembers urging them in the ’90s, ‘don’t call it a uniform civil code, let’s just set up a women’s personal law board, we can look at all personal laws from a women’s perspective’. But to no avail.
Jameela is not a practising Muslim, her personal belief is in a ‘soul’ which has an innate power to guide and give courage. What were her thoughts when the Ram Janmabhoomi conflict was at its height? She recalls a poetic flight of fancy visualising an ‘invisible’ yogini dancing on the domes of the mosque. Yoginis, she explains, are women mystics portrayed in Deccani painting. She is unhappy that the Hindu-Muslim harmony she knew in her childhood days has gone. It went beyond celebrating festivals together and had many dimensions. For example, there was a Telugu teacher who used to visit their house who also had knowledge of Arabic. In the ’90s she organised an exhibition of paintings by artists belonging to different religions using Telugu and Urdu poems to express the ideas in the pictures. Today she is active with other progressive Muslims in the country who are working to bring about both communal harmony and reforms within their own community. She runs a centre in the old city of Hyderabad to conscientise young Hindu and Muslim women in the locality to work together on gender and communal issues that concern both.

The Allahabad High Court on Thursday said that the practice of triple talaq among Muslims is unconstitutional and it violates the rights of women. The high court said that no personal law board is above the Constitution. It said, “Triple talaq is unconstitutional, it violates the rights of Muslim women. No personal law board is above the Constitution.”

The high court’s order deals with the plea by a Muslim man and his second wife seeking protection against police action. The court didn’t pronounce on legality of triple talaq saying that the Supreme Court is seized of matter but observed that the practice of triple talaq is cruel and demeaning. However, the court left the issues of divorce to the first wife through triple talaq as well as second marriage open andn simply dismissed the man’s plea of protection.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Several political parties reacted to the High Court’s say, with both the BJP and the Congress hailing the court’s observation. Muslim Law board, AIMPLB, said that its legal committee will study the verdict and observation after which it will file its appeal against the said verdict. Appreciating the court’s say, social activist Zakiya Soman said, “I welcome the verdict of Allahabad HC, its true that triple talaq is not constitutional and it must be abolished.”
WATCH:

The triple talaq refers to pronouncement of the word ‘talaq’ thrice in one go by Muslim men to divorce their wives.
Earlier this week, Islamic organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind told the Supreme Court there is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law in which triple talaq is deeply rooted. In the argument that it forwarded, the Jamiat stated that the Muslim Personal Law has an element of certainty and is not local or regional in operation.
“There is no scope for interference with the Muslim Personal Law, which is based on primarily the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, explained and applied by various scholars of great antiquity and authority after thorough research,” it said. “The protection of peculiarities in personal laws is necessary for securing freedom of religion and bringing uniformity by removing those peculiarities shall be enforcement of Uniform Civil Code by the judicial process, which shall be against the constitutional bar,” it said.
In November, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) decided to form a women’s wing to discuss the issues of talaq, among several others. AIMPLB passed a resolution in favour of triple talaq. The resolution passed at the AIMPLB’s three-day convention stated that the government was infringing into the personal laws of Muslims."

Jamia authorities have,  meanwhile,  denied pressuring the organisers. “The event was not organised by the university or any of its department. The auditorium was rented out to the organisers and in such events the varsity has nothing to do with either the subject or choice of the speakers. It was not our prerogative,” PTI quoted a Jamia spokesperson as saying.
The seminar at Jamia where Ilmi was invited as a speaker was organised by RSS supported Forum for Awareness of National Security (FANS) whose patron is BJP leader Indresh Kumar. It was supposed to be held on February 16 but was rescheduled to February 28 and the fresh list of speakers did not feature Ilmi’s name. The agenda of the event was discussion on the triple talaq issue. Later, the subject was changed into a discussion on empowerment of Muslim women. The event, it is learnt, faced protests with people terming the topics of the discourse as anti-Quranic.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ilmi, a journalist, started her political career from the Aam Aadmi Party but crossed over to the BJP in 2015. She also accused the English press of bias and presenting a one-sided story, thereby managing to create a narrative against RSS-backed ABVP and BJP.

The BJP leader said there was a lot of pressure on the organisers of the seminar at Jamia. “First they changed the topic from triple talaq to women empowerment. Then they wanted me to be dropped from the speakers’ list. In the first initiation my name was there but in the second card my name was removed.”

“The organisers requested the authorities to allow them to invite me but they said no she will create a lot of

problems. I also learnt that students were gathered outside the programme venue to stop me from speaking at the event,” she added.
Programme convenor Shailesh Vats said, “We had finalised the speakers and the subject but then we were

advised by the university to make some changes saying the atmosphere in the universities is not conducive to have such a discussion.”"
"1617716928-7","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Fair entitlement","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/fair-entitlement-2/","Fair entitlement","June 18, 2000","Ever since the Shah Banu case in the mid-eighties, maintenance for divorced Muslim women in India has remained an extremely sensitive issue, mired in minority/majority politics. The political dispensation had, at that juncture, chosen to manage the crisis by enacting the rather inappropriately termed Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986. Under the new law, the community’s women were rendered ineligible to the provisions of Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which guaranteed maintenance for all divorced women in the country. Instead, Muslim women were only entitled to receive a maintenance allowance for the customary iddat period of three months. It is in this context that the recent Calcutta High Court judgment ruling that divorced Muslim women will be entitled to maintenance until they marry again is something of a landmark.
Not only did it recognise the right of an individual to justice, it also tried to address the unprecedented suffering that many Muslim women experience as a result of being deserted by their husbands or divorced arbitrarily through triple verbal talaq and even postal talaq. The story of Sakila Parvin, who fought the present case doggedly, ever since she was divorced by her husband in 1993, could be that of many others now waging a lone battle for existence with little or no support from their families or their community.
Interestingly, the Calcutta High Court used the provisions of the controversial Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in arriving at its conclusions. It observed that the trial court, which had earlier let Sakila Parvin down in her quest for a fair settlement, had wrongly interpreted this law. The Act has a proviso that “all reasonable and fair provisions and maintenance” were to be made to the divorced woman, and the High Court felt that this must be constructed liberally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Interestingly, in many Islamic nations there have been significant and substantive reform in personal law to ensure, among other things, that divorced women are not left in a limbo. Under the 1961 Family Law Ordinance enacted in Pakistan in the sixties, for instance, not only was polygamy no longer considered an unhindered or unchallenged right of men, maintenance was recognised as the due entitlement of the divorced woman and was not limited to the iddat period. What makes divorce particularly traumatic for Muslim women in India is the fact that they are more likely than not to be poor and illiterate, and therefore without the means to support themselves. 
Desertion by the husband could literally spell the end of the world for them. Their plight must, therefore, be of utmost concern to the leaders within the community who have often taken intransigent and unreasonable positions on the issue. It is time to recognise the need for change, the need to keep up with the times, the need to value individual rights. 
Already, there are significant stirrings, with many Muslim women openly voicing their unhappiness over the treatment that has been meted out to them. The struggle of Sakila Parvin for justice is just one more instance of this."

It will be an understatement to say that the result of the Uttar Pradesh election, where the BJP got an unprecedented three-fourth majority, bagging 325 seats, is historic. It represents, in many ways, a tectonic shift in the polity of India. Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India, is a mini-India with all the currents, cross-currents and strands of competitive politics, in abundance. The Congress held sway over the state for many decades; the BJP too, for a few years, but for nearly two decades, the two regional parties, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), were dominant players. In fact, the extraordinary victory of the BJP in 1991, during the Ram lehar, had become a distant memory.
Then came the new defining moment of 2014, when the BJP and its allies won 73 seats out of 80. However, getting three-fourths of the seats now, 325 in 403 and retaining the same vote share, approximately 42 per cent in 2014, and nearly 40 per cent in 2017, after almost three years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration at the Centre, is phenomenal.
What does this indicate? First and foremost, this shows the profound connect which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has with the people of India, who are willing to trust even the hardest decisions taken by him as beneficial for the country and the common citizen. It is not simply his own charisma — this connect flows from an abiding belief that what PM Modi says is delivered. There is no corruption in decision-making at the central government. Pro-poor initiatives, like the Jan Dhan Yojana, Crop Insurance Scheme, various affordable insurance schemes, Ujjwala Yojana, cooking gas for the poor, electricity to unconnected villages, Swachh Bharat toilets in villages, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, all started showing their results on the ground.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As a minister of information technology, I can say that we have established nearly 2,00,000 Common Service Centres, delivering various digital services across the country, run by small entrepreneurs in Gram Panchayats and semi-urban areas, including minority and Dalit women. In Uttar Pradesh, there are more than 50,000 Common Services Centres. I organised large conferences around these in Varanasi and Meerut and I saw the sparkle in people’s eyes about Digital India and the promise of an exciting future that it holds for them. The phenomenal success of digital literacy, including for aanganwadi workers, was also helping this process. People on the ground were distinguishing with ease between the delivery of government of India programmes and the unfulfilled promises of the Akhilesh Yadav government — which were delivered in a highly partisan and discriminatory manner.
Coupled with this promising delivery was Narendra Modi’s leadership signifying courage and a strong conviction for a corruption-free India. Not only surgical strikes, even his bold gamble to invite a referendum on demonetisation was appreciated by the poor who perceive him as a leader keen to purge India of the ills of corruption and black money. The phenomenal success of these programmes is being recognised and appreciated the world over, but unfortunately, the opposition, primarily because of its antipathy to Modi, mocked at it. The people rejected such negative politics.
I myself campaigned extensively in Uttar Pradesh and one could clearly find a palpable connect between the poor and the prime minister. He is our man, our welfare is central to his priority, felt the common citizen. Therefore, there was a keen desire to bring a government which could work in coordination with the prime minister’s vision. In my considered view, this is therefore a victory of hope: It is an assertion of aspiration for good governance and growth with equity — without corruption.
Along with the extraordinary charisma of the prime minster, we also need to acknowledge the stellar role of the party president Amit Shah, who weaved together a fine rainbow coalition of various castes and communities, including OBCs and MBCs. I would say, not only the forward, backward and most backward castes, large numbers of young people, of all castes and communities — even Muslim women in good number, some of them victims of triple talaq — found solace in the BJP, which had the courage to challenge this menace head-on.
While we need to acknowledge the extraordinary hard work of the booth-level worker and the cadre, such an outstanding result, which never happened in terms of sheer scale before, must also highlight that this can happen only when the desire to bring the BJP to power becomes part of a peoples’ movement.
The BJP has won a three-fourth majority in Uttarakhand too, and even as it has lost Punjab, it is within striking distance of forming a government in Manipur. In all probability, it will retain Goa: The vote-share of the BJP in Goa is 32.5 per cent, while that of the Congress is 28.3 per cent. The extraordinary performance in Manipur, where the BJP did not even have a single ward counsellor, is truly phenomenal. The proud people of Manipur always wanted Manipur to come into the national mainstream.
Overall, today the BJP is truly an all-India party having a pan-India presence, from north to south, east to west. With the latest Vidhan Sabha results, 11 states, including some of the biggest states of India, will have a BJP chief minister. It is also a part of coalition governments in Jammu and Kashmir, Nagaland and Andhra Pradesh. With every possibility of having its own government in Manipur and Goa, the number of states governed by the BJP will only rise. The BJP’s vote share in West Bengal and Kerala has increased, while it is resurgent in Odisha.

All this is without any dynasty or family control — only by sheer hard work, good governance, profound organisational presence and leadership by a selfless person, a man of destiny, Narendra Modi, who has a vision to make India truly a great country. Desh jaagta hai, jagaane wala hona chahiye: The nation rises. But there must be one to awaken it to its destiny."

Look at it, also, to get a sense of how, over the past year, power has changed hands — and how power itself has changed.
To take the second change first, which is also the context in which the first — the movement of the powerful — is to be tracked: More than any other in recent times, the past year has framed and sharpened an absence in India’s liberal democratic imagination.
Liberal democracy in India has always seemed ill-trained in the art of separation that produces a check and balance on power, and is also a way of fragmenting it. Democracy in India doesn’t ask itself the question, at least not often enough, and not with enough sophistication: What are the bases of different institutions? What are the different kinds of power?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is in this space of unasked questions that the steep climb and precipitous fall of individuals in the IE power list tells a story, of course.

Large meanings can also be prised from the small shifts.
The top three of 2016-17 remain the same as in 2015-16 — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat — but with a difference. While Modi remains numero uno, Shah trades places with Bhagwat. The moving up of Shah, the stepping down of Bhagwat, if only by a rung each, speaks of an unfolding realignment within the Sangh Parivar — the dramatic electoral successes of the Modi-Shah election machine are helping them pull ahead of not just their opponents and rivals but also their friends.
The year 2015-2016 was when the political Opposition struck back at the BJP dominance established by its 282-seat triumph in 2014 — first Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP routed the BJP in Delhi, then the Nitish Kumar-Lalu Prasad Mahagathbandhan trounced it in Bihar.
It was also the year when the BJP’s political project seemed challenged by events and stories outside the political arena that snowballed, acquired power, became writ large — the murder of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri over rumours of beef in September 2015, the suicide of Dalit student Rohith Vemula at the Hyderabad University campus in January 2016. This was followed by the spreading protests against the arrest of students in JNU on charges of sedition, which also stoked a wide and vibrant debate on the meaning of nationalism.
Yet, in 2017, that agitation and those debates seem frayed and faded already. Their dramatis personae, like the fiery JNU student leaders, are no longer prominent on the stage. They have been relegated by the inevitable return to business-as-usual, yes, but also by the sound and spectacle of the BJP’s electoral victories, especially and most recently in Uttar Pradesh.
Unsurprising, then, that a host of Opposition leaders move down the power list: Arvind Kejriwal slips from No. 8 to 33, Mayawati who was at 30 last year is now at 50, and Lalu Prasad is down from 26 to 42.
The Gandhis, Sonia and Rahul, may not show as great a fall — from 5 to 9 and from 9 to 10, respectively. But there is a settled stolid dullness to their ranking, especially when you contrast it with the blistering trajectory of Yogi Adityanath, a new entrant at No. 8, or Himanta Biswa Sarma who left the Congress to become powerful in the BJP, and who is also a new entry in the list, at 37.
Nitish Kumar, who had seemed for a while last year to be the emerging rallying point for anti-BJP forces, has receded only from 12 to 13, but in his case, the rungs he hasn’t climbed are more telling.
All those who are on the list are there because of the individuals that they are and because of the institutions and offices that they represent. But the rise in the list of Chief Justice Khehar, from 41 to 4, and the entry of Dipak Misra at 15 and Justice Lodha at 78, owes more to their institution — the judiciary — at a time when other checks and balances on concentrated executive power are waning. How these individuals act on their institutions, steer their course, will determine their ranking in next year’s list.
And what about the non-political powerful of 2016-17? Except for the feisty Kangana Ranaut gatecrashing this list of 90 men and 10 women,

as she has done Bollywood, in the most powerful and empowering way possible, well, what about them?

1. Narendra Damodardas Modi, 66

Prime Minister of India

(Rank 2016: 1)
Why

Because nearly three years into his term, he remains the unchallenged Number 1. Because under him, the BJP looks unstoppable, forcing the Opposition to continually play catch-up. Every key move the Modi government makes — from surgical strikes to demonetisation — is done in his name. Under him, the Prime Minister’s Office wields almost absolute power, inviting awe and criticism in equal measure. His relentless campaigning fuelled the party’s sweep in Uttar Pradesh, setting the stage for 2019. His constant communication underlines the power of his politics.
Power Punch 

Demonetisation. Its economics may have been suspect but its politics was pure gold. He proved his critics wrong and projected the hugely disruptive note ban as a transformational reform that people must support for the greater good. And they did.
What Next 

Halfway into his term, he’s looking beyond 2019. Economy and employment, rising expectations of the young remain his key challenges at home that will also define his place in the world.
By the way

He loves photography, shoots a lot and always directs photographers even as he poses for them.

2. Amit Shah, 52

BJP President

(Rank 2016: 3)
Why

He pushes the RSS chief down one rank because he has established himself as the BJP’s trump card. Despite the criticism over his style of functioning, Shah has proved he is the most effective strategist, whether in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra or Manipur. He not only led the party to historic victories in UP and Uttarakhand by stitching together a new social coalition, but also choreographed the BJP takeover of Goa and Manipur.
Power Punch

Shah stuck to his handpicked candidates for Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, including some who joined the party on the eve of the release of the list.
What next

Elections in Gujarat later this year. He realises the party’s performance here is tied to his prestige as well as that of the PM.
By the way

He has been on a strict weight-loss programme and has already lost over 15 kg.

3. Mohan Bhagwat, 66

RSS sarsanghchalak

(Rank 2016: 2)
Why

Without rocking any boats, like in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee years, he has ensured that the RSS and the BJP government remain in step and in sync. Despite the rebellion in the Goa unit and some swayamsevaks carping over tickets in UP and Uttarakhand, Bhagwat’s Sangh has emerged as the perfect foil to the Modi government.
Power Punch

His public disagreements are keenly heard. For instance, his disapproval of the draft education policy prompted the Centre to review it.
What Next

To push the RSS agenda on triple talaq and empowerment of Dalits and other backward classes, especially in southern states.
By the way

Finds time to watch movies with close friends from Nagpur.

4. J S Khehar, 64

Chief Justice of India

(Rank 2016: 41)
Why

With the judiciary and the executive locked in a struggle over delay in appointments to the higher judiciary and a new Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), the CJI, who heads the collegium that clear the names of judges for high courts and the apex court, plays a key role. Besides, he will hear all important PILs in the Supreme Court.
Power Punch

The SC collegium under him has stood its ground, virtually rejecting every contentious clause that the Modi government wanted in the new MoP.
What Next

He is expected to head the Constitution bench that will decide the validity of Aadhaar and the contours of the right to privacy.
By the way

He often refers to his wife as ‘Sher Khan’ and ‘Tiger’.

5. Ajit Doval, 72

National Security Advisor

(Rank 2016: 18)
Why

Because he is the most important bureaucrat in the Modi government. He has the Prime Minister’s ear on everything, from foreign policy and the challenges of terror to negotiations with the Naga rebels.
Power Punch

Following the public announcement of the surgical strikes in PoK last November, he is said to have controlled the flow of information and played a key role in shaping the narrative.
What Next

To quickly gauge the Trump administration and work on common areas so that New Delhi is able to tap into the new Washington.
By the way

Still responds to every single soldierly salutation in his office with a loud and brisk “vishraam, araam se”.

6. Arun Jaitley, 64

Union Finance Minister

(Rank 2016: 4)
Why

The effective No 2 in the Modi cabinet, Jaitley has the task of steering the economy towards higher growth amid a slowdown resulting from demonetisation. With Manohar Parrikar heading to Goa, Jaitley holds additional charge of the crucial defence ministry.
Power Punch

After a series of hectic negotiations with states and political parties, Jaitley was able to get the Constitutional amendment related to GST passed by Parliament. A crucial indirect tax reform, consensus on which once seemed impossible, GST is likely to be implemented from

July 1.
What Next

Improving the country’s tax base and ensuring that people stay the course on digital transactions.
By the way

He is on very friendly terms with Captain Amarinder Singh, the man who defeated him in the bitterly fought Amritsar Lok Sabha contest.

7. Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, 59

Chairman, Reliance Industries

(Rank 2016: 5)
Why

Continues to remain the richest Indian with a net worth of Rs 1,75,400 crore (US $26 billion), according to the Hurun Global Rich List. He is now focusing on his telecom venture, Reliance Jio, which is making aggressive plans in the segment, giving established players such as Airtel a run for their money. The group’s sprawling media ownership is now a role model for other corporates.
Power Punch

Jio has secured over 10 crore customers in less than six months.
What Next

With Jio set to charge customers from April, his next move in the intensely competitive telecom sector will be keenly watched.
By the way

A nature buff, Ambani loves to visit wildlife hotspots such as Kruger National Park in South Africa.

8. Yogi Adityanath, 44

Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh

(Rank 2016: New entry)
Why

For being chief minister of India’s most populous state, where the BJP and its allies have come to power with a thumping mandate, winning 325 of 403 seats in the assembly elections. A key Hindutva face of the BJP, he surprised nearly everyone by becoming the party’s choice to lead the state government.
Power Punch

When he pipped about half-a-dozen aspirants to the post of CM. Long seen as the fringe in the state BJP, he now represents the ‘mainstream’.
What Next

He faces the daunting task of balancing the demands of his office with those of his restive and aggressive supporters. How he does that will decide how effectively the BJP reaps its electoral harvest in UP. The crackdown on meat and the anti-Romeo squads have dominated headlines but the Yogi story is yet to unfold.
By the way

He is fond of watches. Wears a Rado on his left wrist.

9. Sonia Gandhi, 70

Congress president

(Rank 2016: 5)
Why

Despite her conscious decision to stay away from the limelight and make way for son Rahul, Sonia Gandhi remains the paramount leader of the Congress. The longest-serving president of the Grand Old Party, she is still the last word and the final arbiter in the party. Though her ill health has forced her to curtail her public appearances, she remains accessible to all leaders.
Power Punch

Her strategic absence from the Congress Working Committee meeting, in which her loyalist AK Antony broached the topic of Rahul’s elevation, was a message loud and clear for Rahul baiters to fall in line and reconcile with the new normal.
What Next

With the party battered at the polls, she could step down as president but will remain the figurehead.
By the way

She opens all official communication from Congress office bearers and administrative staff all by herself. Also, she personally puts her replies into envelopes and seals them herself.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-3036520"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg"" alt=""uttar pardesh elections, up polls, demonetisation, demonetisation scam, rahul gandhi, narendra modi, jan aakrosh, modi rahul fight, up rally, indian express news, india news, demonetisation up, elections updates"" width=""759"" height=""422"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/09/rahul-gandhi-main1.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />
10. Rahul Gandhi, 46

Congress vice-president

(Rank 2016: 9)
Why

With mother Sonia Gandhi taking a back seat, Rahul is now in effective control of the Grand Old Party. With the BJP unlikely to have the numbers in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress remains the fulcrum of any Opposition unity in Parliament.
Power Punch 

Even though under him the party has seen a string of electoral reverses, he doesn’t face any major challenge within the party.
What Next 

His long-awaited elevation as Congress president could happen this year.
By the way 

Rahul dabbles in a number of sports. He is a licensed scuba diving instructor, a black belt in Aikido and a squash player. He is currently reading the English translation of the Upanishads.

11. Rajnath Singh, 65

Union Home Minister

(Rank 2016: 7)
Why

One of the heavyweights of the NDA government, Singh has also been the BJP national president. He has enjoyed key posts in the government, in part because he has the complete backing of the RSS. In UP, Singh conducted 102 election rallies, the maximum by a central minister.
Power Punch 

Singh was the soft face of the government during the 2016 Kashmir unrest and has been instrumental in pushing back Left Wing Extremism to an all-time low.
What Next 

With a change of guard in the United States, the next big challenge for the home minister is the upcoming Indo-US homeland security dialogue. Back home, he will have to build a new narrative in Kashmir, along with handling infiltration from across the border.
By the way

Singh is not part of any family WhatsApp group and does not keep a mobile with him.

12. Piyush Goyal, 52

MoS, Independent for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines

(Rank 2016: 46)
Why

His ministry has ensured that there is no scarcity of coal. As a result, while transmission and distribution issues persist, power generation has been sorted out — the country’s ‘power surplus’. In spite of his responsibilities as a senior minister, Goyal was appointed to the two-member ministerial group that was to work out a strategy to promote cashless transactions during the demonetisation period.
Power Punch

Has been tasked with executing PM’s targets, such as “power for all” and annual renewable energy generation of 175 GW by 2022. His ministry has already electrified 70 per cent of the 18,452 villages that the PM wants power to reach by May 2018. He is expected to meet this deadline comfortably.
What Next

Has to successfully supervise non-coal auctions being conducted by the states, and sort out transmission and distribution issues with their help. Will also have to reach target of renewable power generation.
By the way

He hasn’t slept for more than five hours a day since he took charge. Is spiritual and meditates.

13. Nitish Kumar, 66

Chief Minister, Bihar

(Rank 2016: 12)
Why

For being the face of the Opposition and the nucleus of the anti-BJP camp. He is likely to play a key role in putting up a consensus candidate from the non-BJP camp for the post of President of India.
Power Punch

He was the only Opposition leader to back demonetisation, though with a caveat: ‘a good idea, but poorly implemented’.
What Next

In his third term as chief minister, Nitish is definitely looking national with an eye on the 2019 parliamentary elections.
By the way

Has a fascination for the digit ‘7’. Despite moving to the CM’s official 1, Anne Marg residence, he retained his previous address at 7, Circular Road, Patna.

14. Mamata Banerjee, 62

Chief Minister, West Bengal

(Rank 2016: 15)
Why

In her second term as chief minister, she remains the most resolute voice critical of PM Modi and the BJP in a country where the opposition space is increasingly shrinking. Banerjee has been most vocal on the debate regarding federalism, repeatedly accusing the BJP-led Centre of attempting to weaken the federal structure and centralise power.
Power Punch

After her landslide victory in 2011, which ended the 34-year-old Left Rule in Bengal, Banerjee pulled off an even bigger victory in the 2016 Assembly polls.
What Next

Her party will have to contend with the Narada investigations, in addition to the ongoing investigations into chit funds.

She walks 5-6 km on her treadmill every morning. She has repeatedly walked up to 10 kms at a stretch, leaving those behind her puffing away at a distance.

15. Dipak Misra, 63

Supreme Court Judge

(Rank 2016: New Entry)
Why

He is set to take over as the Chief Justice of India in August this year and will have a tenure of over a year. With tension between the Centre and Opposition-ruled states, as well as the ruling BJP and Opposition parties, showing no signs of abating, the Supreme Court headed by him could be called upon more frequently to be the final arbiter in Constitutional matters. He will also head the collegium that will have the opportunity to appoint a large number of Supreme Court and high court judges.
Power Punch

To instill “committed patriotism and nationalism”, he made it mandatory for all cinema halls in India to play the national anthem before a movie begins, with those present in the hall obliged to stand up to show respect.
What Next

The Supreme Court bench headed by him is seized of some very important cases, which include reforms in the BCCI, plea seeking a refund for Sahara investors, the Delhi December 16 gangrape-cum-murder, entry of women into Kerala’s Sabarimala temple and the Cauvery water-sharing dispute.
By the way

He can quote extempore from Shakespeare’s works.

16. Sushma Swaraj, 65

External Affairs minister

(Rank 2016: 10)
Why

Despite her ill-health, she has retained her position as one of the topmost Cabinet ministers in the Modi government. Though she has not travelled over the last year, barring a few occasions, her inputs are considered key to Modi’s foreign policy.
Power Punch

Although recovering from a kidney transplant, she has been alert and active on Twitter. Responds to requests from Indians in distress overseas.
What Next

Her comeback to active official duty in the coming months.
By the way

She is an ardent Krishna devotee, whose images can be seen all over her house.

17. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, 58

Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh

(Rank 2016: 23)
Why

Has spent more time in the chief minister’s office than any politician in the history of the state, which was once a Congress stronghold. The BJP has won two assembly elections projecting him as the CM. Has even busted the myth that the CM on whose watch the Simhastha Kumbh is held always loses the seat.
Power Punch

Having ridden the Vyapam scam, there appears to be no challenger to the chief minister as of now.
What Next

With the assembly elections more than a year away in Madhya Pradesh, there are rumours about his elevation to Delhi as a Union minister.
By the way

Whenever possible, Chouhan loves to take a dip in the Narmada.

18. Devendra Gangadhar Fadnavis, 46

Chief Minister, Maharashtra

(Rank 2016: 25)
Why

From policy decisions in Maharashtra to drawing up the BJP’s political strategy, Fadnavis remains the go-to man. Has mastered the art of dealing with ally Shiv Sena, which often plays the role of an aggressive Opposition, as well as rival parties, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party.
Power Punch

Under him, the BJP won 10 municipal corporation elections, 25 zila parishad and 284 panchayat seats.
What Next

To tackle the Shiv Sena, which is more aggressive after the BJP’s success in the civic polls. His aim to carry out socio-economic reforms in the state will also be tested.
By the way

He likes gola bhat and phodnichi poli.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-4446398"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""422"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/gadkari-sagarmala-759.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />
19. Nitin Gadkari, 59

Union Minister, Road Transport and Highways

(Rank 2016: 20)
Why

He continues to be one of the top performers in the council of ministers with the reputation of being a doer. Modi is said to openly praise him in ministerial and secretary-level meetings. Some in the party say Modi uses Gadkari’s proximity to the RSS leadership to bring Nagpur on board on certain issues. Given the government’s infrastructure push, he is in charge of a key ministry.
Power Punch

With the BJP eight short of the magic figure of 21 seats in the 40-member Goa Assembly, it was Gadkari who worked the phones overtime and got MLAs to side with the party, completely outsmarting the Congress.
What Next

After the success in Goa, his stock in the party has gone up.
By the way

Enjoys spicy food and his favourite dish is Pataudi, a popular preparation from Nagpur.

20. Amarinder Singh, 75

Chief Minister, Punjab

(New entry)
Why

A scion of the Patiala royal family, Amarinder led the Congress to its only decisive victory in the Assembly elections held this year. Is still one of the mass leaders in the Congress even as his party loses ground across the country.
Power Punch

Got his way in the party after threatening to leave and form his own outfit. It led to the ousting of Partap Singh Bajwa, a Rahul appointee, from the PCC chief post.
What Next

From tackling the drug menace to the farm crisis, the new chief minister has several challenges in his second stint at the helm in the border state.
By the way:

Apart from being an author of several books on military history, Amarinder loves gardening.

21. Venkaiah Naidu, 67

Union Minister, I&B, Urban Development

(Rank 2016: 37)
Why

Among the most vocal in Narendra Modi’s cabinet, Naidu handles the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Urban Development, which is overseeing the PM’s ambitious Smart Cities project. Naidu continues to have the faith of the party and the Prime Minister, whom he promotes at every opportunity, defining Modi as ‘Making Of Developed India’.
Power Punch

After the BJP’s resounding victory in Uttar Pradesh, Naidu was chosen as the observer from Delhi in the panel to elect the chief minister. As rumours abound that Yogi Adityanath threatened to walk out with a large number of MLAs if not elected the CM, Naidu is one of the few who knows what really happened.
What Next

With Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar back in Goa and the Presidential election coming up, Naidu may be in the fray for a promotion, one way or the other.
By the way

Throughout his career, Naidu has had narrow escapes in nine aircraft mishaps, involving helicopters and aircrafts.

22. Krishna Gopal, 61

Joint Secretary (Sahsarkaryavah), RSS

(Rank 2016: 69)
Why

As the RSS in-charge of the BJP, he is the official liason between the two. The UP native also helped galvanise swayamsevaks for the recent assembly elections. As mentor of Samkalp, a Delhi-based RSS coaching institute for the civil services exam, he is the driving force behind the Sangh’s efforts to get those aligned to its ideology into the bureaucracy.
Power Punch

Is privy to most major political decisions at the Centre.
What Next

Has been looking to have more hold over the politics of UP but faces a challenge from fellow sahsarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale, who is senior to him and whose base is in Lucknow these days. Was also kept in the dark on the decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as UP CM.
By the way

Prefers gur (jaggery) as dessert.

23. Vasundhara Raje, 64

Chief Minister, Rajasthan

(Rank 2016: 22)
Why

Continues to remain the BJP’s most powerful and popular face in Rajasthan. With the Lalit Modi controversy and the mining scam case firmly behind her, Raje has managed to hold her ground in the state despite frequent demands for quota by the Gurjars and a fractious relationship with the RSS and its affiliates.
Power Punch

Raje has managed to quell the rebellion within the party — five-time BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari had publicly urged the central leadership to remove her — and emerge on top.
What Next

With polls to the state Assembly due next year, all eyes will be on whether she manages to repeat her 2013 feat in the face of anti-incumbency.
By the way

Raje has been presenting the state budget on March 8 for a couple of years now. Besides being International Women’s Day, it is also her birthday.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-4588982"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""422"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/nripendra.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />
24. Nripendra Misra, 72

Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister

(Rank 2016: 39)
Why

Eyebrows were raised in May 2014 when Modi promulgated an ordinance to appoint the retired UP cadre IAS officer as his principal secretary. However, Misra has proved his worth and remains one of the two most powerful people in the current administration. In all policy matters and cabinet decisions, Misra’s inputs play a key role, be it the Jan Dhan scheme, subsidies or the Ujjawala scheme.
Power Punch

The PM’s pet project on rural housing saw Misra oversee the rural development ministry successfully complete the target of 33 lakh houses for this financial year.
What Next

With polls done, he will push for deliveries on key reforms, including disinvestment.
By the way

Misra likes to take a walk at 5.30 am and listen to his favourite singer, Geeta Dutt, before sleeping.

25. Subramanian Swamy, 77

BJP leader

(Rank 2016: 90)
Why

There is no telling who the pugnacious BJP leader will choose as the target of his swipes — the Gandhi family, P Chidambaram, Raghuram Rajan, or even party colleague Arun Jaitley. After his nomination to the Rajya Sabha, Swamy served a notice for a discussion in the House on the AgustaWestland helicopter deal.
Power Punch

His Twitter tirade against Jaitley left the party squirming, but he came out unscathed.
What Next

With BJP in power in UP, he is actively pursuing the Ram temple matter in the Supreme Court.
By the way

His wife Roxna has just written a biography of her husband, which every publisher approached has been too timid to publish. As a result, she has decided to publish it herself.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-4588992"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""422"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/03/p-k-mishra.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />
26. P K Mishra, 67

Additional Principal Secretary to PM

(Rank 2016:32)
Why

If Nripendra Misra is Modi’s policy person, PK Mishra, nicknamed ‘PK’, is the man for governance. Unlike the flamboyant Misra, PK is a behind-the-scenes operator. Considered more powerful than even Union ministers, he was principal secretary to Modi in Gujarat till 2004. Known to come down hard on officers who do not meet the PM’s expectations.
Power Punch

Be it the powerful cabinet committee on appointments or appointing heads to PSUs, Mishra has the last word.
What Next

Mishra’s understanding of grassroots conditions and the agriculture sector are assets at a time when the Modi government is reaching out to farmers and the poorer sections.
By the way

Mishra is often seen in half-sleeved shirts, even in high-profile meetings.

27. Ravi Shankar Prasad, 63

Union minister, Law and Justice

(New entry)
Why

Because he made a comeback into the top echelons of the government in the July 2016 reshuffle, getting back the prestigious Law and Justice portfolio. He is also the BJP’s go-to man for hard-selling the government’s or the party’s point of view.
Power Punch

Getting the Supreme Court collegium to agree to yield to most of the contentious clauses in the draft memorandum of procedure (MoP), over which the previous CJI, TS Thakur, and the government had disagreed.
What Next

Working with the higher judiciary to fill the large number of vacancies in the high courts.
By the way

Prasad likes to return home from wherever he is travelling in India, and clears pending files late in the night.

28. Prakash Javadekar, 66

Human Resource Development minister

(New entry)
Why

Under him, the HRD Ministry has managed to keep away from controversies. In the last six months, he has resolved all differences between his ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office and expedited decisions regarding the IIM Bill. That apart, Javadekar has worked on clearing the backlog of appointments and pushed UGC to approve regulations on setting up world-class institutions,

which is the Prime Minister’s pet education project.
Power Punch

Among the BJP’s biggest gains in the recently concluded Assembly elections was in Manipur, where Javadekar was the party in-charge.
What Next

As HRD Minister, Javadekar’s next big assignment is to revamp the University Grants Commission.
By the way

29. S Jaishankar, 62

Foreign Secretary

(Rank 2016: 33)
Why

Handled MEA in the absence of the minister; is the brains trust for foreign affairs in PMO.
Power Punch

Reached out to key members of the Trump administration.
What Next

Cracking the ice with Pakistan and warming up to Washington.

30. Dharmendra Pradhan, 47

Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas

(New entry)
Why

Seen as an alternative to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. His ministry handed out LPG connections in UP. He also shares credit for the BJP’s sweep in state assembly elections. The prime minister has praised him for pushing his development agenda.
Power Punch

Despite BJD’s grip over Odisha, Pradhan led state BJP to a victory in February’s zila parishad polls.
What Next

Seen as the best bet in Odisha, Pradhan aims to take on the BJD in next year’s polls.
By the way

While travelling, Pradhan packs his own luggage.

31. General Bipin Rawat, 59

Army Chief

(New entry)
Why

General Rawat speaks his mind — he justified the sahayak system, warned soldiers against taking to social media to air grievances, and re-invoked the Cold Start doctrine.
Power Punch

He doesn’t hold back on any subject — he declared public supporters of Kashmir militants be treated as enemies, for example.
What Next

He will have to resolve the turf war between the army and the government over the implementation of the pay commission recommendations.

32. Virat Kohli, 28

Captain, Indian cricket team

(Rank 2016: 42)
Why

The only batsman to average over 50 in all three forms of the game, the Bradman-esque Kohli is now also the captain in all three cricketing formats.
Power Punch

Became the first batsman after Bradman to score double centuries in four successive series. Became the first Indian sportsperson to sign a Rs 100 crore endorsement deal with a single brand – Puma.
What Next

Kohli’s all-conquering Indian team now heads to foreign shores with a quest to set their away record straight. Plus, the team will have to defend the Champions Trophy.

33. Arvind Kejriwal, 48

Delhi Chief Minister

(Rank 2016: 8)
Why

Drops 25 places after less-than-expected gains in Punjab, a failure in Goa. But his brand of urban politics, stressing on schools and hospitals for the poor, is setting the trend for other states.
Power Punch

Doesn’t shy away from speaking his mind, even if it means taking on the PM. Was the first one, with Mamata, to slam demonetisation.
What Next

Municipal elections in Delhi and Assembly elections in Gujarat, where he wants AAP to enter the House.
By the way

Since his last nature treatment in Bangalore, he has given up instant noodles for home-cooked food.

34. Raman Singh, 64

Chief Minister, Chhattisgarh

(Rank 2016: 45)
Why

He’s been CM for 14 years —and counting.
Power Punch

Shunted out SRP Kalluri and met activist Bela Bhatia after she was threatened. Announced 45 lakh smartphones to the poor.

35. Ghulam Nabi Azad, 67

Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha

(Rank 2016: 28)
Why

The Gandhi family’s go-to man, Azad has a soft demeanour and political skills, which have come in handy to forge Opposition unity in the Rajya Sabha.
Power Punch

He was the instinctive choice of the Gandhis when poll strategist Prashant Kishor reportedly wanted Madhusudan Mistry removed as Uttar Pradesh polls in-charge.
What Next

Has the tricky task of keeping the Opposition united in the Rajya Sabha.
By the way

He likes to play golf. The lawn at his official residence turns into a mini golf course once in a while.

36. Mehbooba Mufti, 57

Chief Minister, Jammu & Kashmir

(Rank 2016: 14)
Why

As CM of Jammu and Kashmir and with her party, the PDP, in a coalition with the BJP, she has, as her predecessor Omar Abdullah said recently, “the most difficult job in India to handle”.
Power Punch

Over the last six months, she has tightened her grip on the party by elevating several members of the Mufti clan to the top posts.
What Next

She has to walk a tightrope between her basic political instincts and the demands of her coalition partner. Summer in the restive Valley is her challenge.
By the way

A fitness enthusiast, she has a gym at her Srinagar residence.

37. Himanta Biswa Sarma, 48

Cabinet Minister, Assam Convenor NEDA

(New entry)
Why

One of the key figures behind BJP’s stunning victory in the 2016 Assam elections. He was also appointed convenor of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA).
Power Punch

His NEDA engineered the first BJP government in Arunachal Pradesh by getting the entire Congress to defect to the party.
What Next

Building on the BJP’s growing footprint in the Northeast.
By the way

Sarma is also a writer. His two books, Samagata Samay (2014) and Anya ek Dristikon (2016), have run into several editions.

38. Siddaramaiah, 68

Chief Minister, Karnataka

(Rank 2016: 54)
Why

The CM — having joined the party just over a decade ago — has been able to shrug off allegations of corruption and remains the unchallenged leader of the Congress party in the state.
Power Punch

Following the SC orders in 2016 to release Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu, he defused tensions by co-opting Opposition parties in the crisis resolution process.
What Next

Assembly elections in 2018 — the polls will be a test of his governance.
By the way

Siddaramaiah did not go to school until he was 10 years old, but was the first person from his village to get a bachelor’s degree.

39. Arvind Subramanian, 57

Chief Economic Adviser

(Rank 2016: 38)
Why

Proposed the Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency to tackle banks’ non-performing assets. Was also behind the Universal Basic Income proposal in the Economic Survey this year.
Power Punch

With Standard & Poor’s ruling out an upgrade in the country’s rating, citing India’s low per capita GDP, he slammed rating agencies for their “inconsistent” and “poor” standards.
What Next

His idea of Universal Basic Income was supported by Arun Jaitley, who hopes to introduce it next year.
By the way

He is fond of American literature.

40. Ram Madhav, 52

General Secretary, BJP

(Rank 2016: 70)
Why

After turning the tide for the BJP in Assam and J&K, Madhav has now delivered Manipur for the party, despite not getting a majority in the state. He is considered to be among the few to have direct access to both the PM and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.
Power Punch

His Manipur strategy pushed the party’s tally from a mere two to 21 seats in the state Assembly.
What next

Madhav’s next stop is Meghalaya. Known as the general secretary with the Midas touch, he is seen by many as a successor to Amit Shah, if the latter moves to Gujarat.
By the Way

An avid reader, he has over 4,000 books in his personal library.

41. Urjit Patel, 53

Governor, Reserve Bank of India

(New entry)
Why

As the RBI governor, he steers banking and monetary policies which influence the country’s economy. The RBI’s decision to approve demonetisation, however, came under criticism, with Patel, a low-profile and media-shy governor, also facing flak for not communicating its policies to the public.
Power Punch

The RBI board cleared the demonetisation proposal within two months of Patel’s elevation as governor in September 2016.
What Next

Will have to tackle inflation and boost growth at the same time, while bringing down bad loans. Details on demonetisation are yet to be announced.
By the way

Patel was born in Kenya, where his father owned a spare parts business.

42. Lalu Prasad, 70

RJD chief

(Rank 2016: 26)
Why

Lalu Prasad’s RJD holds equal weight in the ruling alliance in Bihar. He continues to command support of his core Muslim-Yadav vote base.
Power Punch

During the Uttar Pradesh elections, Lalu made it evident that he did not want Nitish to be part of any alliance against Mulayam Singh Yadav. The JD(U) eventually didn’t contest.
What Next

His obvious goal is to see his son, the deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, as Bihar chief minister. His perfect political proposition appears to be to have Nitish at the Centre and his son in Bihar.
By the way

Lalu Prasad tells his social media managers to keep his posts raw and rustic.

43. Mukul Rohatgi, 61

Attorney General of India

(New entry)
Why

After President’s Rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, the Centre’s top law officer has bounced back. He got the SC to offer a sympathetic ear to the Centre’s arguments in cases such as demonetisation and Aadhaar.
Power Punch

His reappointment when his term ends in June is considered a certainty.
What Next

Likely to assist the apex court in two important cases: Aadhaar and the Assam citizenship law.
By the way

He loves expensive cars and is known to own many.

44. Fali S Nariman, 88

Constitutional jurist

(Rank 2016: 48)
Why

Continues to be one of the most respected voices in the Supreme Court. Often appointed as the amicus curiae in many cases.
Power Punch

Despite the SC’s wish, he stayed away from the matter of BCCI reforms.
What Next

Assisting the SC in deciding whether a State and persons holding public offices could make statements about a crime which may affect the morale of the victim and has a negative impact on society.
By the way

Admits that as far as Zoroastrianism is concerned, his son, Justice Rohington Nariman, is more knowledgable than him.

45. Pinarayi Vijayan, 73

Chief Minister, Kerala

(New entry)
Why

Is the undisputed leader of the CPI (M) in the state, where it’s called the Pinarayi Vijayan government rather than an LDF one.
Power Punch

Despite staunch opposition from right-wing organisations, Vijayan went ahead and addressed a communal harmony rally in Mangalore in February.
What Next

Vijayan will have to prove his mettle as an able administrator. Nine months into his tenure, the government has been hit by law and order issues.

48. Chandrababu Naidu, 66

Chief Minister, Andhra Pradesh

(Rank 2016: 44)
Why

Since the 2014 bifurcation, Naidu has led and built Andhra Pradesh from scratch. His land pooling strategy for the new capital, Amaravati, is now considered a model for land acquisition.

50. Mayawati, 61

President, Bahujan Samaj Party

(Rank 2016: 30)
Why

Despite her party’s poor performance in the UP Assembly elections, Mayawati remains a prominent voice among BJP’s opponents.
Power Punch

Her allegations saying tampering of EVMs was the reason for BJP’s victory have now been backed by other parties. Mayawati has also said she would move courts for an inquiry.
What Next

With the BSP’s tally in the Assembly now reduced to just 19 seats, she must keep her party united in the face of criticism. She is also likely to lose her berth in the Rajya Sabha next year and would need the support of either the SP or the BJP to get re-elected.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the “most bitterly criticised” person post Independence, BJP chief Amit Shah said today, adding that if criticism was targeted against the country, it cannot be called freedom of expression. “Sab se jyada katu alochana agar kisi ek vyakti ki hui hai azadi ke baad, to wah hai Narendra Modiji ki. (After the

Independence, if there is one person who has received the most bitter criticism, it is Narendra Modiji),” he said at the inauguration of ‘India Idea Conclave 2016’ here.
“Alochana ka swagat hai. Alochana ko sahan bhi karna chahiye. Magar Narendra Modi ji ki alochana se ek kadam aage jakar agar isko desh ke virodh ki disha mein le jayenge to kshama karna ye sacchi swatantrata nahi hai abhivyakti ki. (Criticism is welcome and it should be tolerated. But if someone goes beyond that and targets the country, it cannot be pardoned or termed as freedom of expression),” he said.
Shah said although dissent was part of the democracy, if it continued in an unwarranted way, there could be no

development. “If people do not understand this, the purpose of democracy will collapse. The purpose of democracy is to ensure that development reaches the last man in the society – who can utilise the same to explore his maximum potential to realise his freedom,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP chief alleged that the country got good governance after 68 years of Independence, when the Modi-led

government came to power. “We spoke about the all-inclusive development. In the 2014 elections, after 30 years a single party got majority in Parliament,” he said, adding that the government has implemented reforms in every sector.
Referring to the row over the issue of triple talaq, Shah said, “When the Union government has taken a stand, there

was no scope for confusion on the issue.” “The Constitution has given right to every woman to live safely here. Had you ever imagined that women’s issues could be a part of Prime Minister’s speech on Independence Day? But when BJP came to power, it became part of the PM’s speech,” he added."

Coming of               age 
•               It’s high time to reduce the retirement age of central Government               employees from 60 (‘Law Ministry OKs reducing retirement age from               60 to 58’). This will not only provide more jobs for the unemployed,               it will give the government more money, which otherwise would have               been paid as salaries to senior level employees. Some state government               still follow the system of keeping the retirement age for its employees               at 55.

Not democratic               
•               Democracy has no meaning if the Cabinet rank was given to the Congress               president. In no democratic country will you find an extra constitutional               authority like that presently functioning from 10 Janpath. Also,               even those who are out on bail from jail have become ministers.               That proves that the Westminster model of democracy is not suited               to India. We need a prime minister who is directly elected by the               majority of the people and not one who gets the chair as per the               whims and fancies of MPs, nay as per the wishes of a single person               who has all the powers without the slightest accountability or responsibility.               The ministers who are out on bail from jail can never be justified               by any argument or counter argument. But the people of India have               no choice but to tolerate such eventualities as a fait accompli.

•               Sanjoy Hazarika, a former correspondent of New York Times,               who is also a research professor at the Independent Centre for Policy               Research and consulting editor of The Statesman, has issued               the following statement in response to a report in The Indian               Express, titled ‘‘Ulfa rejects mediator, denies feelers to government’’,               published in the edition dated 18 June, 2004. 
               I am appalled and anguished by the report in The Indian Express               of June 18, 2004, where, in remarks attributed to Paresh Barua of               ULFA, I have been falsely described as a an agent of the RAW intelligence               agency. This is absurd. The reporter further claims that I had offered               to mediate between the ULFA and the government. This is absolutely               false. At no point of time, either now or in the past, have I offered               to do anything of the sort. The statement that a few of us had signed               a couple of days ago merely called for talks between the Government               of India and the ULFA, if necessary in a third country, because               Assam has suffered for too long from conflict, bloodshed and confrontation.               None of us in that statement (see text below) offered to mediate.               
               I hold The Indian Express, a paper for which I have extensively               written over the years, and its editors in high esteem. But this               report has hurt me deeply because it impugns my integrity and character;               it has caused great anguish to me and my family members. Your reporter               in Guwahati did not have the elemental courtesy or professionalism               to check with me before rushing into print. In the process, he did               not remember that last December, in a move which was widely reported               and appreciated, during the anti-ULFA operations in Bhutan, Jahnu               Barua, Dr Indira Goswami, Patricia Mukhim, Bhagat Oinam and I had               issued a statement urging for openness about the Bhutanese military               campaign and demanding human rights for the captives, especially               women and children. 
•               The following is the text of the appeal: We welcome the recent positive               remarks of political leaders from Assam and of Shri Arobinda Rajkhowa,               chairman of the United Liberation Front of Asom, with regard to               the possibility of opening a dialogue between the Government of               India and the ULFA, and the need for a political solution to a problem               that has affected Assam for decades. Assam and the North-East are               weary of violence. We need peace, stability and freedom from fear.               Too much blood has been spilt, too many lives have been lost, too               many tragedies have taken place in the past decades. As a result,               development has been disrupted and traditions have suffered. A majority               of our people remain isolated from the processes of development,               poor and marginalized. It is a time for healing and justice, peace               with justice and dignity. We call upon the Government of India and               the ULFA to begin the process of dialogue and talks, if necessary               in a third country, with an open mind and determination to reach               a political settlement so that a traumatic chapter in the life of               our beloved Assam is closed and a new one begins. It is time to               work together for a strong, stable and developed Assam, using the               natural advantages, resources and skills of its people.

Terming as “unjustified” the controversy over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “raincoat” jibe at Manmohan Singh, Union Minister Rajnath Singh today said the remark did not amount to contempt and suggested that the Congress leader too had been unsparing in his criticism. “He (Modi) did not commit contempt against anyone with his raincoat comment. We all respect Manmohan Singh. It was just to point out corruption during previous UPA regime,” Rajnath said. “Modiji has in fact praised Manmohan with his comment as even after a number of corruption charges on the government, there was no blot on his (Manmohan’s) image. The controversy is unjustified,” the BJP leader said at a press conference here.

Congress and BJP are locked in fiery exchanges over Modi’s remarks in Parliament, with the opposition party announcing his boycott during the remainder of Budget session and insisting on his apology for the “abusive” and “insulting” remark.
Rajnath recalled that the former Prime Minister had termed demonetisation as “organised crime” while speaking on note ban in the House.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It means what government has done is organised crime. PM is the head of the government. If you go into detailed meaning of his (Manmohan’s) statement, it will mean crime is being committed by criminal. Think where his remark is pointing out to,” he said, adding, “We should not get into details of such trivial things.”
To a question on bringing back underworld Dawood Ibrahim, Rajnath said the government had given all documents to Pakistan and attempts were underway to get him extradited.
On the ‘triple talaq’ issue being included in BJP manifesto, the minister evaded a direct reply saying the matter was sub-judice."

(File)
Tarek Fatah, Canadian author of Pakistani origin, who loves an anti-Muslim rant — clearly, there’s nothing like self-loathing to excite the basest instincts of your audience — wanted to speak last at his session at the Ideas India conclave, organised by the BJP-RSS thinktank, the India Foundation, in Goa over the weekend. But the organisers realised he couldn’t have the last word — certainly not after Jamiat-Ulema-i-Hind leader, the mild-mannered Mahmood Madani, had had his say. So they insisted Fatah go first. Unsurprisingly, he brought the house down. BJP general secretary and India Foundation director Ram Madhav could be seen discreetly motioning to the moderator to quickly end the session.
Soon, it was Madani’s turn to speak — and the crowd began to taunt him over his refusal to roundly condemn triple talaq. Madani’s attempts to warm the crowd (“Indian Muslims are Indian by choice, not by chance,” he said, pointing out that his ancestors were against Partition) were received with pointed silence or muted catcalls.
Only the day before, BJP president Amit Shah had again reminded the audience of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s determination to protect the rights of Muslim women. To its credit, the BJP has picked up the modernising strain in the Muslim community and decided to run with it — happily, the marathon coincides with upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. As for the Congress, the blindside on this matter remains fully in place since Rajiv Gandhi bailed on the 61-year-old Shah Bano in 1986.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But the hardest clapping during Amit Shah’s address was reserved for his comment that it was alright to criticise politicians (“I cannot count the times Narendra bhai has been criticised and it’s fine”), but any criticism of the nation would not be acceptable. Sweekaar nahin hoga. So when I asked what Shah meant by his conception of nationhood, and whether it had changed from the time of Ashoka, Buddha, Akbar, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru upto today — including a ban on NDTV, for example, which has since been put on hold — a distinct murmur ran through the crowd.
The NDTV question pushed Rajya Sabha MP and session moderator Swapan Dasgupta to say, with some alacrity, that in the wake of the media coverage of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, national security would not be compromised. So when the NDTV reporter pointed to the ammunition dumps and the manner in which the terrorists had scaled the wall at the Pathankot base, Dasgupta said, it was but natural the network had to pay for the reporter’s extraordinary enthusiasm.
Except that Dasgupta’s alacrity contradicted two senior RSS and BJP leaders’ views who, speaking on condition of anonymity, told me they disagreed with the ban. Curtailing the guaranteed right of freedom of speech and expression was certainly not the way to deal with a critical media, both leaders said.
Several others at the conference, from RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale to India Foundation director Shaurya Doval (son of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval), were clearly keen to send out the message that the RSS and BJP in power were much more inclusive organisations. Hosabale practically disavowed Tarek Fatah’s anti-Muslim rants, pointing out that the essence of democracy is dialogue. “On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the disagreement between Krishna and Arjun is called the ‘Krishna-Arjun samvad’. If there is dialogue, dissent should be acceptable,” Hosabale said. Doval remarked, “It doesn’t matter if we disagree. But at least let us respect each other’s views. After all, we are all Indians.”
Certainly, the Conclave was an opportunity for the converted to assert their ideologically right-wing point of view. Doval pointed out that when he and Ram Madhav inaugurated its first edition three years ago, the audience was simply grateful, “they had got a chance to speak out after years of being suffocated under the Congress regime.”
Certainly, economist and best-selling author Sanjiv Sanyal, whose number Amit Shah is said to have on speed dial, believed Tarek Fatah had been successful in calling out the hypocrisies of upper middle-class India. And even though Ashok Malik of the Observer Research Foundation said he’d like the party to abandon its victimhood and get down to the task of ruling India and Rathin Roy, director of the finance ministry thinktank, National Institute for Public Finance and Policy, warned the audience not to fall into the trap of the unidimensional “Macaulay-putras”, the clapping for Arnab Goswami (“I believe the left liberal is an oxymoron”) rivaled that for the BJP party president.
This is the kind of conference it was. Jawaharlal Nehru University Vice-Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar cast much heat and light on the despairing state of Indian education, but didn’t make a single comment on the disappearance of JNU student Najeeb. And in response to a remark by Shekhar Gupta, editor of the online portal The Print, who pointed out that six undertrials had been killed in cold blood after they escaped from Bhopal prison, BJP member Nupur Sharma asked him why he hadn’t also spoken about the policeman those undertrials had
It certainly escaped her that in a democratic nation, the state simply cannot employ the same gruesome tactics as murderers."

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Sunday said the matter of triple talaq was not an issue among Muslims and that it had been brought up to implement a uniform civil code in the country.
Speaking to The Indian Express, AIMPLB executive member Dr Asma Zehra said: “The so-called movement against this law has been started to introduce a uniform civil code in the country. It is more of a media hype… the issue is of no importance among Muslim women and there is no need to bring about any change in the laws.” She was speaking on the sidelines of a press conference held against the demand to modify the triple talaq system.
“A lot of counselling is required for women who seek help in such cases. There are several women organisations in Kolkata. We are in talks with some which work at the ground level. We are also mulling the idea of setting up a helpline to reach out to the women in distress and counsel them,” Zehra said.

“In case a marriage is dissolved, the Shariyat ensures that the rights of the woman are not denied. People do not know about these rights. They need to be taught how to exercise their rights,” she added.
Zehra said as opposed to the common notion, Islam does not provide an easy divorce.
“It is rather an unfavoured and unwanted safe exit when all other means fail to save a marriage… According to statistics, the divorce rate is lowest in India when compared to the western countries,” she added.
“Around 10 crore Muslim women are happy with the existing rules. If there is anyone who feels suffocated under the Shariyat laws, she can get married under the Special Marriage Act-1954 norms,” said Zehra.
The Act was enacted to provide a special form of marriage by any person in India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries irrespective of the religion either party to the marriage may profess.
Asked if there was a need to revisit the talaq laws, as demanded by some, Zehra said: “Taking the matter to court will go against the woman concerned. With the introduction of Section 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining a married woman with criminal intent) of the Indian Penal Code, women thought they would teach men a lesson. But what followed in most cases was painful litigation.”
“Our judiciary is already overburdened. On an average, while a lower court takes four years to dispose of a case, in case of higher courts, it is eight years. During this time period, social and financial problems multiply, especially for the women,” she added."

Once she had even dialed the Child Helpline Number in Mumbai alleging that her daughter is being molested and a team of the Child Welfare Committee was alerted by their counterparts in Mumbai, along with a police team who tried to locate the woman,but were unable to do so.
The building, in which the woman along with her daughter was residing, has more than 20 rooms which were all rented out by the owner. Sunita Devi, a neighbour of the woman, said, “The woman even accused our children of physically assaulting her daughter. We even heard the screams of the girl but couldn’t help her.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“Development and national security are definitely issues. Who did take this decision (of surgical strikes)? It is this government that showed the political will of crossing the border. The army carried this out but the decision was of the government,” said the leader, who did not want to be quoted, in an informal interaction with reporters.
BJP will get a strong majority in the polls scheduled for early next year, he asserted. The saffron party has been out of the power in the country’s largest state for close to 15 years. Riding the ‘Modi wave’ it had swept UP in the Lok Sabha polls but is now facing stiff fight from two regional parties, ruling SP and BSP, which have ruled it by turn all these years.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The issue of surgical strikes will appeal across the caste divide in the state and, BJP leaders believe, will fetch them extra votes in a same manner as Modi’s “developmental agenda” did in 2014 Lok Sabha polls.
The Samajwadi Party remains a strong rival, he said, despite the feud in the ruling Yadav clan as it has a “big base” and BSP supremo Mayawati’s appeal to Muslims to vote for her party is an indication that its support base was slipping away.
BJP is better prepared for the assembly polls compared to the Lok Sabha poll in UP, he said, adding that it has formed booth committees in 87 per cent of total booths against 36 per cent in 2014.
Asked what difference does he find in the UP election compared to Bihar, another key Hindi heartland state where the party had lost badly last year, he said light-heartedly, “There is a change in atmosphere. Surgical strikes have happened.”
He also rubbished the opposition’s criticism of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar over his comments over the strikes, wondering who will speak if not the Defence Minister on this issue.
Asked about the issue of triple talaq among Muslims, he said the party and the Centre remained firmly against it.
A section of Muslim clerics has lashed out at the government over its stand on the matter, presently being heard by the Supreme Court.
He, however, noted that the matter has been in courts since the UPA’s time and not “BJP-sponsored”.
If the issue flares up, it will only help the party, BJP leaders said."

BJP Rajya Sabha member Vinay Katiyar’s effort to rekindle hopes of a Ram temple at a rally in Ayodhya on Thursday was met with sober claps from spectators and near silence from Home Minister Rajnath Singh on the dais.
“Winning Uttar Pradesh is very important for the BJP. If we get a good majority in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will get majority in the Rajya Sabha. If the party has the majority in the Rajya Sabha, the temple will be built,” Katiyar said.
He added that any development work would be incomplete without the construction of Ram Mandir. “We have to build temple here. It is important for the unity and integrity of this country.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Katiyar said the country should have a uniform civil code and “triple talaq is an injustice to Muslim women” and has to be “banned”. “In fact, there has to be a law on single marriage. Otherwise, in three-four marriages, there would be three-four children each and the family size becomes 20-25.” Katiyar said.
Daya Prasad, who has a shop in Hanuman Garhi in Ayodhya, did not seem impressed with Katiyar’s speech. “The temple has become a word for leaders to use during elections. It has become just an election issue.”
Another shopkeeper, who gave his name only as Umesh, said: “It is true that Modiji is doing well. But we want temple and there is no sign of temple other than in speeches.”

Rajnath, who addressed the rally after Katiyar, did not mention the temple, nor did he speak on triple talaq. The minister’s reference to Lord Ram was confined to the context of Ayodhya’s development. “Ayodhya has not seen the development that it should have. Fifteen years have been wasted. We promise that if the BJP comes to power, this land of Lord Ram will see development. It will be a centre of international attraction,” he said, adding that millions of pilgrims visit the town every year.
Singh spoke at length on how the BJP-led Centre deals with Pakistan. “Today India is not a weak nation, it has become a strong country before the international community,” he said, while speaking about the surgical strikes. When his reference to the military operation received loud applause, he added: “India was never expansionist, nor did we attack anyone…. Bharat ek aisa desh hein jo kisi ko chedta nahin hai. Lekin jo Bharat ko chedta hai, usey Bharat chodta nahin hai (India is a country that does not needle any other. But India does not let go of anyone challenging it).”
He ridiculed Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav for his slogan “kaam bolta hai”, which translates to performance speaks for itself. “Kaam bolta nahin hai, dikhta hai (Performance does not speak, but it shows),” Singh countered."

Senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and RLD chief Ajit Singh Wednesday met Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav at his residence here to discuss modalities of an alliance for the Uttar Pradesh polls.
During the meeting, several issues, including ticket distribution, were briefly discussed, but no concrete proposal was formalised, sources said. Mulayam is learnt to have told Yadav and Singh that he will get back to them after discussing the issue within his party.

The SP has declared candidates on some seats and sounded aspirants on many others. These include several seats in western UP, where RLD has stakes. “It was a brief meeting over breakfast, as Mulayam Singh Yadav had to catch a flight to Lucknow. A clear picture will emerge after a party meeting in Lucknow on the issue,” a source said.
Sharad Yadav and Ajit Singh did not divulge details.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, Singh had said “give and take” is necessary if an alliance has to be forged, while JD(U) leader K C Tyagi had voiced disappointment over Mulayam’s silence on the issue when leaders of several parties attended SP’s silver jubilee celebrations in Lucknow on November 5.
Besides Yadav and Singh, H D Deve Gowda of JDS, Lalu Prasad of RJD and Abhay Chautala of INLD were present at the November 5 event.
With the BJP raising issues of triple talaq and migration of Hindus from communally charged Kairana during its Parivartan Yatra, RLD and JD(U) have accused the party of pursuing an “overall strategy of polarisation”.
On a day Yadav and Singh met Mulayam, RLD leader and Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary told The Indian Express that the BJP will try to make communal statements and build up an atmosphere of polarisation. JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi said communal polarisation in UP is a bigger challenge than it was in Bihar, and that the parties that want to stop BJP should join hands. “They (BJP) are trying to portray a community as criminals. Their sole strategy will be to make such statements and build an atmosphere. We have said we will not let western UP become a nursery for communal hatred,” Chaudhary said.
Tyagi said, “BJP started its Parivartan Yatra from Saharanpur. One should remember that from Muzaffarnagar, where communal riots broke out before 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Darul Uloom Deoband and Kairana are not far off. The issues raised by BJP there are triple talaq and Hindu migration. While slamming BSP and SP for sheltering criminals, Amit Shah took only Muslim names. All this should leave no doubt what BJP wants.”
So far, there has been no direct talk between leaders of the Congress and SP on the alliance issue, but Congress’s poll strategist Prashant Kishor has met Mulayam and SP general secretary Amar Singh in Delhi and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow over the last few days.
The Congress has said that Kishor has met the SP leaders in his personal capacity."

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has decided to discuss key religious reforms,including the controversial triple talaq,during its three-day general body meeting here beginning from March 19. 
The top Muslim body will also hold an open session to ascertain the views of the community members on triple talaq and ways to check its misuse. Widespread social evil of dowry will also be discussed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To spread awareness among the Muslim women on their rights,mehar (gift by the husband to wife at the time of marriage),a womans share in parental property,triple talaq and dowry will top our agenda during the meeting, said Maulana Khalid Rashid,a member of the Board and general secretary of the organising committee for the three-day meet. The board will also discuss the model nikahnama, he added.
Admitting that the concept of tripe talaq is being misused,Rashid said: Triple talaq in a fit of rage or for any other reason has no basis in the Shariat law. If there is discord between husband and the wife,efforts for reconciliation must be made by parents,elders and the society. If these fail,the couple can approach the Darul Kaza (Shariat court) and they should accept the judgment given by the Mufti.
Rashid,who is also the naib imam of Aishbagh Idgah here,said an open session will be held on the last day of the meeting on March 21 to gauge popular response.
Shaista Amber,chairperson of the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board,welcomed the move. 
Its a vindication of our stand. We have been leading the battle for the restoration of rights of the Muslim women as enshrined in the Shariat law,but the mullahs had always opposed us. They even dismissed our campaign as un-Islamic.

Private property?               
•               Apropos of the editorial, ‘Don’t bank on banks’ (IE, June 21), Indira               Gandhi when she became the prime minister, nationalised banks and               then used them as the private property of the Congress/government.               The result was an increase in non-performing assets. The mindset               of the Congress has not changed. Loan melas have not been announced               yet, but we can expect something of the kind in the budget. Let               us pray for good sense to prevail and that the FM will make separate               provision without banking on the banks’ money.

•               From Day One of assuming the US presidency, George W. Bush had plans               to attack Iraq (‘Fahrenheit 9/11’, IE, June 19). All his energy               was devoted to creating, rightly or wrongly, propaganda against               Saddam Hussein. You are absolutely right, the manner in which America               deploys its power in combination with its foreign polices and in               pursuit of its interests are now in question. Iraq will indeed test               the depth of “American values”.

The Shiv Sena on Thursday voiced its support for abolishing the triple talaq system, saying this tradition illustrates how tough is the battle of justice for Muslim women in the country.
“The All India Muslim Personal Law Board and other related organisations refused to make any changes in the “triple talaq” tradition last year. The tradition illustrates how tough is the battle of justice for Muslim women in our country,” the Shiv Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Sammna.
The editorial also slammed the ‘secular’ people, who have voiced their opinion on ill-traditions in Hinduism but are maintaining a silence on this issue.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The secular people, who used to advocate their opinion on other issues, are maintaining a stoic silence on the issue of triple talaq. They talk of ill-traditions in Hinduism, but are maintain a silence on the ill-traditions in Islam,” the editorial added.
The Shiv Sena said this movement is getting a new lease of life after the 1980’s Shah Bano case.
“Women like Shamina Yasmin from Guwahati and Shamima Farooqui along with Saira Banu (who challenged the triple talaq in the Supreme Court) are still fighting this battle,” the editorial said.
The Shiv Sena further said the fight of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) is getting a pan India support and will eventually act as a ray of hope for the Muslim women.
“There would be several attempts to suppress these voices and a comprehensive effort at every level is needed to make this movement a success or else the Muslim women won’t be able to see a morning rise when triple talaq is abolished,” the editorial added.
The reaction from the Shiv Sena comes after over 50,000 Muslim women signed a petition to abolish the triple talaq system of divorce – which has come under fire lately by women’s groups for its widespread misuse.
The BMMA has sought the National Commission for Women’s support to abolish the practice of ‘triple talaq’ while dubbing it as an “un-Quranic” practice.
A case is being heard in the Supreme Court in which petitioner Shayara Bano has challenged the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, in so far as it seeks to recognise and validate polygamy, triple talaq and nikah halal."

Having collected 50,000 signatures so far in support of the demand, the organisation has also approached the National Commission for Women (NCW) urging it to back the campaign.
“A national signature campaign is underway in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, MP, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala, UP etc. So far, 50,000 signatures have been collected where women and men have endorsed abolition of triple talaq. Many more signatures would be collected in the coming days,” said BMMA convenor Noorjehan Safia Niaz.
“Muslim women are entitled to their Constitutional rights and any practice or law that is violative of the Constitutional principles of justice and equality must be abolished. Just as with other communities Muslim women want to reform the personal law in practice currently and bring it on par with the Constitutional and Quranic principles of gender justice,” stated the BMMA letter to NCW chief Dr Lalitha Kumaramangalam.
It also said while codification of the entire Muslim personal law was the long-term objective, in the short run a legal ban on the practice of triple talaq would bring relief to lakhs of Muslim women. The BMMA has claimed that the state should ban this practice and also work towards a swift codification of Islamic law.

Conservative clerics have opposed the move saying oral talaq is part of “divine laws”, which cannot be changed. Several Muslim countries such as Iran, Morocco and Jordan have, however, banned oral talaq."

(PTI photo)
2016 can be summed up as a year when the Law Ministry came under constant fire of outgoing Chief Justice of India T S Thakur for rising vacancies in the higher judiciary even as its efforts to finalise a document to guide appointments in high courts and the Supreme Court failed to get finalised.
On its part, the ministry appointed 126 judges this year, the highest number in the past several years.
On April 24, those present at the inauguration of the Chief Ministers-Chief Justices conference were shocked to see Justice Thakur in tears in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Watch what else is in the newshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The CJI lamented government’s “inaction” in raising the number of judges from 21,000 to 40,000 to handle mounting cases, saying, “you cannot shift the entire burden on the judiciary”.
“Nothing moves”, an unusually emotional Thakur said, recalling a 1987 Law Commission recommendation to increase the number of judges from then 10 judges per 10 lakh people to 50.
Days after Justice Thakur had quoted the Law Commission recommendation on judge-population ratio, the then Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda said the report was not based on scientific data.
At the conference, it was decided that an extraordinary provision of the Constitution would be used to appoint retired high court judges in high courts to help bring down rising pendency of cases.
But days after the Law Ministry approved the minutes of the conference, it told a Parliamentary committee that there is no mechanism in place to deal with complaints against retired judges.
As of now, names of 18 retired judges from six high courts for re-appointment are pending with the government.
Another major point of confrontation was the decision of the government to return the names of 43 candidates for appointment as high court judges to the Supreme Court collegium.
Out of the 43 names, the collegium reiterated the names of 37, deferred three proposals while three other names are still with it.
On November 18, the Supreme Court had informed the government that it had reiterated every one of the 43 names that was sent back by the government to the collegium for reconsideration.
But Minister of State for Law P P Chaudhary told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that the collegium has reiterated its recommendation for 37 candidates only.
The main sticking point between the government and the judiciary remained the finalisation of memorandum of procedure — a document which will guide future appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the 24 high courts.
While the Supreme Court collegium rejected the first draft, the second draft sent to it in August is still pending. A decision is now expected after Jagdish Singh Khehar takes over as the CJI on January 4.
The decision of the government to refer the controversial uniform civil code matter to the Law Commission to see whether it can be implemented is another issue which kept the Law Ministry in the limelight.
Amid voices of protest and support, the Law Commission sought views of the public on the common code and triple talaq. Till December 22, it had received over 40,000 responses."

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu Friday asked the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) not to force its view on others and make it political on the issue of Law Commission’s questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code.
“You want to boycott Law Commission, then it’s your choice,” Naidu was quoted saying by news agency ANI. The minister added that it is not proper to drag the name of the prime minister every time.

“Triple talaq is being linked to Uniform Civil Code but main issues are gender justice, non-discrimination and dignity of women,” said Naidu, who called for a healthy debate on the issue. He promised that nothing will be imposed on the people.
The AIMPLB slammed the government Thursday for creating discord between communities, saying the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) was against the very constitution of India.
“It seems that the Modi government is using UCC as a ruse to divert attention from its failures of the last 30 months. It is a new war the government is waging. Sarhad to sambhal nahin rahi, andarooni jung ki taiyyari kar rahein hain (They cannot protect the borders but are preparing for internal strife),” Maulana Wali Rehmani, general secretary of AIMPLB alleged in a press conference.

However leaders of the BJP have maintained that the issues of UCC and triple talaq are disparate and should not be seen as extensions of each other.
The BJP-led Centre has told the Supreme Court that triple talaq, an Islamic divorce practice, is violation of gender equality and unconstitutional."

(Representational image)
Instead of raking up the triple talaq issue, the government should focus more on education and other basic facilities to India’s “under-privileged” communities, including Muslims, a woman leader of the Jamaat-e-Islamic Hind (JeIH) said on Tuesday. JeIH Secretary Atiya Siddiqua said a negative image of Muslims was being portrayed to show Muslim men as dominant and women as victims.
“These practices have been in Islam since the beginning. Why was there no hue and cry (about it) so far? Why did this happen all of a sudden?” Siddiqua asked. She added, “The fact is that the practice of polygamy among Muslims is too low than other communities and the percentage of divorce is also least among Muslims.”
Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement asking Muslim leaders not to politicise triple talaq, Siddiqua said it was the government which was unnecessarily blowing triple talaq and polygamy out of proportion.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She asked the government not to interfere in Muslim religious matters and termed polygamy as a “divine law and boon for society” because it can give social and financial security to widows and uplift their status. She said the Jamaat had been conducting a pan-India awareness programme with Muslims over issues like marriage, divorce and inheritance. The 15-day awareness programme ends on May 7.
“During our visit to various slum areas (in Uttar Pradesh), Muslim women told us that the education of their children was their priority. It (triple talaq) is a non-issue. It is being politicised unnecessarily. The government should take up issues like education and basic facilities… for underprivileged,” Siddiqua said.
She said Muslim clerics have also been advised to deliver Friday sermons related to Muslim personal laws and eliminate misconceptions about it. Shaista Rafat, in-charge of JeIH Delhi and Haryana women wing, said Islamic laws were “divine and they are for the good of people. Those who say these practices should be abolished are unaware about the Shariah laws.”
The BJP-led central government has been pushing for a ban on the practice of triple talaq — verbally divorcing wife by uttering the word “talaq” thrice.
The debate against the practice was fueled when a woman in Uttar Pradesh lodged a complaint against her husband who had allegedly threatened her with triple talaq after she delivered a girl child. The practice is not followed in at least 22 Muslim countries including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia."

The BMMA has stated that by releasing stories of unilaterally divorced women, it could make members of the community realise the unfairness of the practice. “Ramzan is a month of introspection and reflection. This Ramzan, we request the Muslim community to look within and make attempts for a better tomorrow. Muslim women today are completely at the mercy of an un-Quranic practice. Lives are ruined when at his fancy and whim a Muslim man unilaterally divorces his wife,” BMMA convenor Noorjehan Safia Niaz said.

Niaz claimed that the stories of 30 women would be released on the BMMA’s social media platforms to mark each day of the holy month. “Each day of Ramzan this year will give an opportunity to the Muslim community to reflect on our own deficiencies as a community.

However, several Muslim countries such as Iran, Morocco and Jordan have banned oral talaq in their country. The BMMA has launched a slew of activities to increase public awareness against the practice. It had recently collected 50,000 signatures seeking abolishing of triple talaq.
The organisation has also approached the National Commisison for Women to enlist its support for the campaign."

The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Central Government on plea of a Muslim woman challenging the Constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’ to end a marriage. The apex court has tagged this plea with pending matter in court. The petitioner Ishrat Jahan has sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was unconstitutional, as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.
In her petition, Jahan has asked whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have custody of her children. A batch of petitions is being heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice T S  Thakur and notices have already been issued to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and others.
However, this is not first such type of petition that has been presented before the Supreme Court. Uttarakhand based Shayara Banu, another Muslim woman and the Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh through its president Farah Faiz, have raised similar queries. On July 29, the apex court had favoured a wider debate on the petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq. All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) president Shaista Ambar has demanded abolishing of the triple talaq system.
Talaq-e-bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing the word “talaq” more than once in a single tuhr (the period between two menstruations), or in a tuhr after coitus or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple-talaq). The Centre has set up a high-level committee to review the status of women in India, and according to reports, has recommended a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq (divorce) and polygamy."

With the Supreme Court set to hear petitioner Ishrat Jahan challenging the constitutional validity of the triple talaq system, senior advocate R K Kapoor said Friday that if the fundamental rights of any Indian citizen is violated, irrespective of gender, then he or she can knock at the door of the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. In her petition, Jahan has raised the question whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in the matrimonial home as also her claim to custody of her children.
Kapoor told ANI that this issue of delivering triple talaq on mobile phone has risen recently and the matter has been presented before the Supreme Court. “It would be relevant to say that when the fundamental rights of Indian citizens, irrespective of gender, are affected, then he or she has a right to knock the door of the Supreme Court,” Kapoor said.
“And, infact, Article 32 (of the Constitution) itself is a fundamental right, where the person can knock the door of the Supreme Court if there is a violation of his or her fundamental rights, particularly under Article 21, vis-a-vis any religious community or otherwise,” Kapoor added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Kapoor further said, “If there is a contrast, or there is a violation of fundamental rights vis-a-vis the other rights given under personal law, then the honourable Supreme Court will go into this issue which is already pending before the honourable Supreme Court, and this matter will also be tagged with that.”
The apex court agreed to hear on Friday the writ petition filed by Ishrat Jahan from Howrah through advocate V K Biju, who mentioned it before a bench comprising of Justices A R Dave and L Nageswara Rao. Ishrat Jahan has four kids aged between seven and 12 years, who were forcibly taken away from her and now she does not know their whereabouts.
In her petition, she sought a declaration from the court that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was unconstitutional, as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.
On July 29, the Supreme Court had favoured a wider debate on the petitions challenging the validity of the triple talaq. Earlier, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the Jamiat-e-Ulema had defended the practice of triple talaq, saying it was part of the Quran-dictated personal law which was beyond the ambit of judicial scrutiny."

BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday said the Supreme Court should decide the issue of triple talaq as per the Constitution to ensure justice for Muslim women. “Our party wants the Supreme Court to take a decision on the issue of triple talaq as per the Indian Constitution, keeping the state and central governments out,” she said while speaking at Ambedkar Jayanti function of the party here.
“From media reports, it does not seem that senior persons associated with the Muslim personal law boards are serious about Muslim women getting justice on the issue of triple talaq…we do not feel that the board will be able to ensure justice for Muslim women soon…the apex court should ensure justice for them,” she said.
In October last year, Mayawati had criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his stance on the issue, saying such matters should be left to the Muslim community and not be raked up, specially on election eve, for political gains.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The prime minister and the central government instead of interfering in the issue of triple talaq should better leave it to the Muslim community to form a common opinion,” she had said.
Raising a question mark on the functioning of the Yogi Adityanath government, Mayawati said its policies are hollow. The closure of slaughterhouses has forced those involved in its trade to knock the doors of the court, she said.
On demands to close down liquor shops in populated areas, she said her party supported it but termed as unfortunate the BJP government’s silence on the issue for its economic gains and capitalist mentality.
They have maintained silence as they know that the areas where there are liquor shops are inhabited by Dalits, backwards and the poor among the upper castes whom this government wants to harm though liquor shops, she said.
On farmers’ loan waiver, she said that loans up to only Rs one lakh have been waived off and this is a betrayal for people who were promised full loan waiver by Modi while campaigning for the recent Assembly polls.
“Farmers are sitting on dharna also in the national capital but the BJP government is not concerned about them,” she said.
On the law and order issue, she said there was no improvement visible under the Yogi government and crime in the state is going on as before.
“(But) for diverting attention (from such issues) this government is using media to focus on probes into the works of the earlier governments,” she said.
“Our party is not against probe in scams like the one relating to memorial construction but it should not be conducted with a casteist, religious mindset or for political vendetta,” she said.
On the massive departmental reviews being undertaken by the chief minister, she said merely enacting laws, holding reviews or its publicity in media will not improve the lot of people.
She also lamented a lack of upkeep of the memorials and statues set up by her government in honour of great ideologues of her party. She also formed a five member committee of her partymen to inspect them and meet the Chief Minister in this connection besides making their report public through the media.
She also cautioned her party leaders not to meet BJP or other party MPs, MLAs or ministers for redressal of problems faced by their people or partymen and instead meet officials for the purpose."

((Source: Express photo by Tanmay Thombre)
Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal, Pune
It’s not easy being a rationalist in Pune these days. It’s even more difficult, perhaps, to be one striving for a more ‘liberal’ Islam at a time the community sees itself under a threat.
Professor Shamsuddin Tamboli, the president of Pune’s Muslim Satyashodkak Mandal (MSM), is used to the criticism and threats. He was under one such firestorm recently for his criticism of the ‘fatwa’ issued against Iranian director Majid Majidi, composer A R Rahman and others involved in the making of a film on Prophet Mohammad. In a press release on September 14, the MSM called the fatwa a “Talibani” act.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tamboli, who calls himself a follower of both the late MSM founder Hamid Dalwai and Narendra Dabholkar, says the threats don’t matter. “Dalwai dared take out a rally of divorced Muslim women to the Vidhan Sabha long back in 1966 and demanded uniform civil code,” he says.
Since Dalwai’s death in 1977, seven years after he founded the MSM, around 200 progressive Muslims associated with the movement are taking his message across Maharashtra. At the helm is Tamboli.
One of the times he got death threats “of a serious nature”, he remembers, is when he wrote a series of articles on “liberal Islam” in a regional newspaper during Ramzan.
Speaking of the attacks he faced for his stand on the fatwa against Majidi and Rahman, Tamboli says he told one of his critics, “If you are a supporter of Raza Academy and Mufti Muhammad Akhtar, who issued the fatwa, then you are an IS supporter. Who are you to oppose the film? There is a Censor board to take care of this.”
He adds, “We believe Islam is liberal, spreads peace, humanity. There is a need to understand Islam in the modern context. So we conduct activities like blood donation camps on Bakr Id.” According to Tamboli, they want Muslims to understand the true meaning of “qurbani (sacrifice)” in the festival. It is “sacrifice for society”. “So we appeal to Muslims to celebrate Bakr Id in the real sense by donating blood to save someone’s life,” says MSM secretary Prof Azaruddin Patel.
The first such blood donation camp on Eid was inaugurated by Dabholkar. Tamboli calls him an “inspiration”. The anti-superstition activist, belonging to the Maharashtra Andhashradhha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS), was shot in Pune while on morning walk on August 20, 2013.
The MSM has also been fighting for the rights of Muslim women, including campaigning against triple talaq and polygamy. “There has to be a law to prevent such practices. So we want changes in the Muslim Personal Law Board,” says activist Rubina Patel of Nagpur.
Above all, Tamboli says, the MSM believes in Constitution, secularism. “We do not encourage madrasa education, which takes a Muslim away from the mainstream. We talk against the burqa. We condemn terrorism and unconstitutional fatwas. Even during the controversy over International Yoga Day, while some Muslim outfits said ‘Islam khatre mein hai (Islam is in danger)’, we said yoga is not un-Islamic and is good for health.”
Ironically, Tamboli says, the MSM finds itself in the crosshairs on both sides. “On the one hand, due to our views, some Islamic groups call us Hindutvawadi. On the other, our efforts to bring communal harmony are hurt by Hindu extremist forces. In Belgaum, Karnataka, the local unit of Shri Ram Sene opposed my lecture on Shivaji Maharaj in February 2013. I could deliver my speech only under heavy police security.”
Dabholkar’s work gets a push

According to Narendra Dabholkar’s outfit Maharashtra Andhashradhha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS), their numbers have been only growing since he was killed in a mysterious attack in August 2013. “The number of MANS branches has increased from 220 to 310 in the last two years. Our website has got over 1.25 lakh hits in the same period. Hundreds of youths have joined us voluntarily,” says Avinash Patil, who heads the MANS now.
A few months after the killing, an anti-superstition legislation was passed by the state. “About 160 cases have been registered in the state under this Act so far,” points out Patil."

Maintaining that the Opposition was spreading “rumours” and attempting to mix up the “different topics” of Uniform Civil Code and “triple talaq”, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra argued that the Centre had simply placed before the Supreme Court an affidavit stating the constitutional position on the matter.

“There are rumours being spread which are looking to mix the two topics. A rumour is being spread that the government is trying to ban triple talaq, but this isn’t the case. What the government has done is place before court its position on the matter,” Patra told The Indian Express at a conference organised in the city by BJP on the issue.
Previously, the Centre had stated that absence of reforms in the community over the last 65 years has left Muslim women “extremely vulnerable, both socially as well as financially”. On Friday, the Centre impressed upon the Supreme Court to do away with the practice of polygamy and triple talaq. The Centre also said these practices “cannot be regarded as essential or integral parts of the religion”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The affidavit, submitted by the Union law ministry in response to petitions challenging polygamy and triple talaq, said the validity of these practices required “reconsideration” by the top court “in light of the principle of gender justice and overriding principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality” as well as “evolution of women”.Kolkata NewsWest Bengal phase 3 voting today: Swapan, Ashima among 205 candidatesWon’t let any move to stop polls mid-way: Mamata BanerjeeCoal pilferage: Abhishek dares Centre to start investigation against all culpritsClick here for more
“The court had asked the Centre, and we had placed the affidavit before them as per the constitutional mandate. It is in line with articles in the Constitution relating to freedom and against discrimination. However, it is very unfortunate that the Opposition is trying to spread these rumours for political gain,” Patra added."

The editorial in Organiser, ‘The Women Upsurge’, says that the entire discourse following the BJP’s victory in Uttar Pradesh “grossly neglected or undermined the gender dimension of (the) voting pattern”. “It is believed that in Bharat voting is a family affair and by and large, the political affiliation of the head of the family influences the voting pattern of other members,” it says. However, the editorial notes that from the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, “there is a visible trend of autonomous voting in this invisible category of [women] voters”. Contending that the “recently held elections” indicate that “women voters in Bharat are showing a distinct and autonomous voting behaviour”, it credits the change to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “his policies”.
It cites the instances of UP, Punjab and Uttarakhand, where women outscored men in terms of voter turnout. Noting that “there were definite issues that shaped the women’s participation,” it says that the “deteriorating law and order situation was the biggest issue in UP which Delhi media tried to underplay”. “The onslaught of goondaism and (the) insensitivity of (the) police force hamper gender security the most,” the editorial says, adding that “for the ‘secular’ parties, the Triple Talaq issue may be a communal one but for the victims of this male-dominated practice, it is an issue of gender justice”. Modi’s focus on this issue “certainly tilted women voting in the BJP’s favour”.
NDTV under scannerhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An article in Organiser, ‘NDTV Frauds’, notes details that point to the Delhi High Court ruling against NDTV that “quashed the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal order which stayed the recovery of fine”. Noting that the “shares of NDTV are (now) trading down,” it says that “there is a signal that the government is serious about white collar crimes”. The article underlines the June 2016 penalty order of an assessing officer that “had asked the company to explain the reasons why a penalty of Rs 525 crore should not be imposed on it”. “The assessment order clearly mentions that the assessee (NDTV) created a layer of subsidiaries in foreign countries and channelised the money through these shell entities,” it says. “The then Group CEO of NDTV, K.V.L. Narayan Rao admitted under oath that the sole purpose of creating these companies outside India was to circumvent the restrictions imposed under Indian regulations,” it says.
The article also gives the “modus operandi of the transaction”, explaining the “placement and layering of money outside India”. It gives details of the “four subsidiaries,” and then points out how this money was brought into “India and a cobweb structure was created to escape any scrutiny”. Questioning these “murky deals”, it says, “it is the time when Mr Prannoy Roy should appear and explain the position to his shareholders and viewers”(sic).
Victory of ideology
The editorial in Panchjanya comments on “the meaning” of recent assembly election results. One way to analyse these results is to take note of the losing parties and their internal dissent. However, the second way is to analyse the voter’s mind. While the first perspective would paint a picture of political disintegration, the measure of the people’s vote would help us understand the changing waves of Indian democracy, the editorial explains. “What does the BJP victory imply?” it asks, responding that “this victory is to the BJP’s credit,” confirms the “faith of people in the BJP,” and the “investment of popular ambitions in a political party, the biggest asset of any political party”.
“The BJP has reached this position by holding onto its ideology and expanding its base,” it says, underlining that this has been earned after decades of dedicated work. This victory is not “magic” or “mere sentimentalism”, it is the result of “hard work”. It then contends that the BJP government was “necessary” in Manipur and Goa because “void and lack of alternatives” do not bode well for politics. Claiming that the victory is not of a single person, the editorial says that it is the victory of an ideology, which has no alternative. The results have also conveyed to the media that “it is not proper to become the messenger of political parties”.
Many journalists who were loud on social media damaged the credibility of the media as they had “lots of analysis” but “did not have their feet on the ground”.

Congress on Sunday sought to downplay the triple talaq issue, saying the “matter is in Supreme Court”, while former Rajya Sabha MP Obaidullah Khan Azmi, a new recruit in the party, asserted that he will oppose any “wrong move” on the issue by the government. Azmi, who had vehemently opposed the Supreme Court judgment in Shah Bano case, said, “I am an office-bearer of All-India Muslim Personal Board. If the government tries to misuse it or make any wrong move on the issue then I will fight against it. I will oppose it in my individual capacity.” Azmi said this when asked about his stand on the triple talaq issue in the presence of senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.

However, Azad tried to play it down saying, “since the matter is in the Supreme Court, there will be no discussion on it.” He said the BJP-led government is trying to divert the attention of the people from their promises made during the Lok Sabha elections by raising such issues. “(Priem Minister Narendra) Modi had said there will be no unemployment, price rise will be curbed, black money stashed abroad will be returned to the country. So what happened to those promises? The government has failed miserably in fulfilling any promise. That is why they (BJP) want to keep

people engaged in other issues. So one should not fall into the trap,” he said.
To a question on filmmaker Anurag Kashyap’s tweet seeking the Prime Minister’s response on the issue of banning Pakistan artists, Azad took a potshot at Modi’s Pakistan trip, saying “I have never gone to Pakistan, neither do I have any relative in Pakistan. You should ask this question to those who go to attend weddings there.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The release of Karan Johar directed “Ae Dil Hai Muskil” is facing problem because of the involvement of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in the film.

Kashyap, who himself has had run-ins with the censor board, yesterday tweeted “@narendramodi and you actually diverted your trip on our tax money,while the film shot then was on money on which someone here pays interest.”
Asked about the ongoing infighting between Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the Congress veteran said, “This is a fight between father and son and let them decide it.” However, he added that “Akhilesh seems to be clean.” Welcoming Azmi into Congress fold, Azad said, “He has rich political experience. He is also a secular person and we welcome him into our party today.”"

The Centre will be opposing in the Supreme Court the triple talaq practice on the grounds of women’s rights, terming it as “inalienable” and asserting that the issue should not be seen from the prism of uniform civil code, a highly placed government functionary said today.
The Law Ministry will file a consolidated reply on the issue in the apex court by the end of this month. The issue is being deliberated upon at inter-ministerial level which includes ministries of Home, Finance and Women and Child Development apart from the Law ministry.

“We shouldn’t approach it from (the prism of) uniform civil code. We need to talk in terms of rights of women. Our reply is going to be only on rights. A woman’s rights are inalienable and according to the Constitution she has to have the same rights as men.
“Every court decision has slowly been taking us to these uniform rights. The practice of triple talaq doesn’t exist even in Pakistan or Bangladesh. Only we have it,” the senior functionary said.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi met last week to deliberate on government’s possible stand to be taken in the Supreme Court on the issue of Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and ‘nikah halala’ (a practice where divorced women, in case they want to go back to their husbands, have to consummate a second marriage).
According to this source, there was a consensus among all the senior ministers present to look at the contentious issue through the prism of gender rights.
Early this month the Supreme Court gave the Centre four weeks to submit its reply to a batch of petitions on triple talaq.
The first among these pleas was filed by Shayara Bano from Uttarakhand who challenged the practices like triple talaq, polygamy and “nikah halala” as being unconstitutional.
Two women divorced through triple talaq from Jaipur and Kolkata also approached the court. Their petitions and a number of supportive pleas filed by Muslim women’s organisations have all been bunched together.

Opposing these petitions in court are the Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).
AIMPLB had told the apex court earlier this month that personal laws can’t be re-written in the name of reforms and

The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to elicit views of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq based on which it will present its side in the Supreme Court hearing the matter.
“The state government will put its side in the SC on triple talaq after taking views of Muslim women”, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said while holding a meeting with the Women and Child Development Department yesterday night.
Directing officials to prepare a plan for taking views of Muslim women, the CM asked minister of the department and all women ministers in his cabinet “to talk to women organisations”. A two-day meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) scheduled here from April 15 will also be discussing the issue of tripe talaq.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Many Muslim women have filed PILs in the Supreme Court challenging the provision of triple talaq and ‘nikah halala’, terming them regressive. The Board, however, has opposed the PILs and filed counter affidavit in the apex court defending Muslim Personal

Laws and triple talaq.
The Centre had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
The apex court had taken suo motu cognisance of the question whether Muslim women faced gender discrimination in the event of divorce or due to other marriages of their husband.
The CM also directed officials to prepare rules regarding compulsory marriage registration in the state. During the presentation of the minority department, the Chief Minister asked officials to modernise madrasa education and include English, professional and skill development courses also. He also directed that land be identified in every district for construction of community centres for minorities

and all arrangements be made for Haj pilgrims."

I received a questionnare from the chairman of the Law Commission of India recently. The fifth question in it was: “Should the uniform civil code be optional?” In this article, I elaborate the answer I gave the Law Commission.
I said those who are against the uniform civil code (UCC), whether on the basis of religion or on grounds of deep-rooted customs of the so-called Adivasis, should be given a limited option. The limited option can’t be an absolute option, but only a qualified option. The limit, I proposed, should read like this: “Those who are opposed to a UCC may be given an option to not follow it. But in that case they will have to forego their right to vote in the elections to the state assemblies and Parliament.” The reason is simple.
Article 44 of the Constitution says that “the state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a unifom civil code throughout the territory of India”. The word “shall” is important. It connotes that it is mandatory for the state to take steps to have a UCC. Till now no government has taken even a small step in that direction. The present BJP government deserves praise that it has decided to abolish the practice of “triple talaq” prevalent in the Muslim society.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is true that Article 44 is included in Part IV of the Constitution, which states the “Directive Principles of State Policy”. It is also mentioned that the provisions contained in this part shall not be enforceable by any court of law, but the same article — Article 37 — further states that “the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws”. As stated above, no government in the past cared for this most benevolent principle of governance, that is, to have a common civil law.
The state legislature and Parliament are the creations of our sovereign Constitution — Article 168 gives sanction for state legislature and Article 79 constitutes the Parliament. Therefore, those who do not want to be governed by Article 44 will forfeit their right to vote in the elections to the state legislature and Parliament. No one shall be allowed to have a selective attitude about the Constitution.
However, they will remain citizens of this country and, therefore, will be entitled to civic amenities. For this purpose they can contest and/or vote in the elections to the local bodies, that is, village panchayats, zilla parishads, muncipalities or corporations as the case may be.
I am of the firm opinion that common civil law, like the common criminal law, does not infringe on any religion. I am told that in the state of Goa, common civil law is prevalent and in that state even Muslims live as Muslims. Similarly, Muslims will remain Muslims in Bharat even if there is a common civil law. But if some sections of Muslims want to follow certain obsolete practices, they will have to pay a price for that. I hope, except a few political parties that follow vote-bank politics, no one will mind this limited option.
The government, instead of getting entangled in the intricacies of various modes of inheritance, should immediately introduce a bill to enact a common law of marriage and divorce. This law will solve the problem of “triple talaq” as well as address the discrimination against Christian women seeking divorce."

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said that one will see a “transformed” Kashmir in a year “no matter how the change takes place”. “You will see a transformed Kashmir in a year. No matter how the change occurs, one thing is certain, that there will be a change in Kashmir in a year’s time,” he asserted. Jammu & Kashmir is ruled by the BJP-PDP alliance government headed by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. Singh attended the ‘Lokmat Maharashtrian of the Year Awards’ function on Tuesday.
Speaking during an interactive session at the event, he said former Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah should not have supported the stone pelters. The National Conference (NC) president had recently defended the stone-pelting youth in the Valley, saying they are fighting for the nation and for the resolution of the Kashmir issue as per the wishes of its people.
Singh said he “fully agrees” with Army chief General Bipin Rawat’s remarks about dealing sternly with those trying to hinder security forces from performing their duties in Kashmir. “Those doing such things will have to face the consequences,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Uttar Pradesh, Singh said that he credits Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah, workers of the BJP and the NDA for the victory in the Assembly elections in the northern state. “I thought we would get around 250 seats. We didn’t expect we will get 325 seats in UP,” he said.
On the issue of triple talaq, he said the government’s stance in this regard is clear. “Such a provision isn’t there even in Quran,” he added.
On construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Home minister said that the issue is sub judice. “If both the sides reach a solution, it will be alright but if not, then all will have to abide by court verdict,” he added.
Singh observed that there is a need for a consensus on anti-cow slaughter legislation. On fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, the senior BJP leader said, “there is no doubt that he is still in Karachi. In the last 10 years, India has sent a lot of dossiers on him (Dawood) to Pakistan. He is an accused in 31 cases, including the Mumbai serial blasts.”"

Amidst the ongoing debate over abolition of triple talaq, NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar on Friday said the issue should be left to the Supreme Court to decide. “Let the SC decide on triple talaq,” he told reporters. Anwar, a Lok Sabha MP from Katihar, however, personally wants triple talaq to be abolished. He said several Muslim countries have done away with the practice and it does not have the sanction of the Quran and the Hadith.

The All India Muslim Personal Board (AIMPB) has vociferously opposed any move to abolish triple talaq, saying it will be an infringement on the personal law governing the minority community.
On the strife in Jammu and Kashmir, Anwar blamed the ruling PDP-BJP coalition government for the “mess” in the border state and said that the people felt cheated in the manner the state government has handled the law and order situation there.

“A piquant situation prevails in Jammu and Kashmir as there is a coalition government comprising two parties (PDP and BJP) with neither having the mandate of the people to be in power,” the NCP leader said.
On the surgical strikes by the Indian Army across LoC recently, he said the credit went entirely to the armed forces for destroying terror camps across the border.
Anwar ridiculed the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government for taking credit for the surgical strikes."

“They have backed the BSP movement, and the entire country is in the know of this,” she said. The BSP chief “advised” the BJP government to work out the shortcomings of its “immature decision rather than hiding them”."
"1617716924-6","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Fair entitlement","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/fair-entitlement/","Fair entitlement","June 17, 2000","Ever since the Shah Banu case in the mid-eighties, maintenance for divorced Muslim women in India has remained an extremely sensitive issue, mired in minority/majority politics. The political dispensation had, at that juncture, chosen to manage the crisis by enacting the rather inappropriately termed Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986. Under the new law, the community’s women were rendered ineligible to the provisions of Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which guaranteed maintenance for all divorced women in the country. Instead, Muslim women were only entitled to receive a maintenance allowance for the customary iddat period of three months. It is in this context that the recent Calcutta High Court judgment ruling that divorced Muslim women will be entitled to maintenance until they marry again is something of a landmark.
Not only did it recognise the right of an individual to justice, it also tried to address the unprecedented suffering that many Muslim women experience as a result of being deserted by their husbands or divorced arbitrarily through triple verbal talaq and even postal talaq. The story of Sakila Parvin, who fought the present case doggedly, ever since she was divorced by her husband in 1993, could be that of many others now waging a lone battle for existence with little or no support from their families or their community.
Interestingly, the Calcutta High Court used the provisions of the controversial Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in arriving at its conclusions. It observed that the trial court, which had earlier let Sakila Parvin down in her quest for a fair settlement, had wrongly interpreted this law. The Act has a proviso that “all reasonable and fair provisions and maintenance” were to be made to the divorced woman, and the High Court felt that this must be constructed liberally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Interestingly, in many Islamic nations there have been significant and substantive reform in personal law to ensure, among other things, that divorced women are not left in a limbo. Under the 1961 Family Law Ordinance enacted in Pakistan in the sixties, for instance, not only was polygamy no longer considered an unhindered or unchallenged right of men, maintenance was recognised as the due entitlement of the divorced woman and was not limited to the iddat period. What makes divorce particularly traumatic for Muslim women in India is the fact that they are more likely than not to be poor and illiterate, and therefore without the means to support themselves. 
Desertion by the husband could literally spell the end of the world for them. Their plight must, therefore, be of utmost concern to the leaders within the community who have often taken intransigent and unreasonable positions on the issue. It is time to recognise the need for change, the need to keep up with the times, the need to value individual rights. 
Already, there are significant stirrings, with many Muslim women openly voicing their unhappiness over the treatment that has been meted out to them. The struggle of Sakila Parvin for justice is just one more instance of this."

“Would the Sangh Parivar be ready to let go of Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) tax rebates they are getting?” the Lok Sabha member from Hyderabad said, when asked if his party is in favour of a debate on uniform civil code.
“There are 16 Directive Principles in our Constitution. One of them talks about total prohibition (of liquor). Why don’t we talk about it and have total prohibition throughout India because it’s also mentioned as Directive Principle,” Owaisi told reporters.

He noted there is data which says many women are being harassed or beaten by their drunkard husbands, and that one of the major causes of road accidents is drunken driving.
“So, why don’t we have total prohibition in India?” he asked.
Owaisi also noted that a section in Article 371 of the Constitution gives “special provisions” to Nagas and Mizos.
“Will you be taking that off?” he asked.
“These are the questions which one must answer and in a pluralistic and diverse country like India, you cannot have a uniform civil code because this is the strength of India,” he said.
“We celebrate our pluralism because this is the country which celebrates religion. You cannot have one uniform civil code. So, this is next to impossible in India,” he said.
On whether there is a need to review ‘triple talaq’ and polygamy in Muslim personal law, Owaisi said, “This question has to be answered by Islamic theological ‘Ulemas’, experts and Muslim scholars.”"

BJP CHIEF Amit Shah on Tuesday said the party winning recent bypolls in Assam and Madhya Pradesh and civic polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat showed people’s support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move and claimed some Opposition leaders were upset as their money, “looted” in scams, has turned into trash.
“While the Opposition is organising Bharat bandh and Akrosh Diwas… everywhere BJP has posted unprecedented victory… People across the nation is supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his decision of demonetisation… You all tell me… are you with demonetisation or with bua-bhatija,” Shah asked the gathering at party’s parivartan rally in Maharajganj on the Indo-Nepal border. He was referring to BSP chief Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

“Rahul baba, Akhilesh babu, behan Mayawati… gareeb ke paas kala dhan nahi hai… aapke paas jo pada tha who sara ka saara doob gaya (Poor do not have black money… the black money you had has gone waste),” said the BJP president.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Stepping up attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said: “SP, BSP, Congress, Mamata (Banerjee), (Arvind) Kejriwal are all angry with Narendra Modi today. Do you know why… what was amassed through loot has been turned into raddi (trash) by Modiji on November 8… Modiji has announced that those depositing large amounts in their accounts like Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore… the looted money will be used for welfare of the poor.”
Taking on Akhilesh, he said, “If farmers in UP are not getting benefit of schemes, the Akhilesh government is responsible… The PM has launched schemes for the welfare and empowerment of farmers. The ruling party of UP is full of land mafias and the government cannot work for the development of the state.”
Taking a dig at the previous UPA regime, Shah said: “For 10 years, those amassing trillions of rupees in their homes through scams are today angry with Modi… Till the morning of November 8, they all used to ask Modiji, what have you done against black money and today they are asking why have you done this… The country is with Modiji… it is in favour of demonetisation.” He also alleged that fake notes had made their way into India during UPA rule.
Hitting out at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for his ‘khoon ki dalali’ remark on surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah said Modi government took action within 10 days of the Uri attack unlike the previous government. “But Congress shehzada (prince) says Modiji indulges in khoon ki dalali… Rahul baba, how will you know the value of Army jawans’ bravery… how will you know the value of their sacrifice… it is invaluable,” Shah said, claiming that no one can dare touch the boundaries of the country under the BJP government.
Speaking on triple talaq, Shah claimed that while SP, BSP and Congress are in support of the practice, the BJP-led Centre wants to restore rights of Muslim women.
“Shouldn’t Muslim women have rights? But SP, BSP and Congress believe that the country should follow triple talaq,” Shah claimed. He went on to appeal to the masses to make UP elections “a poll for women’s rights”, so that people cast their vote on this issue.
Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, in his address, said members of terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen had misused Nepal border to enter India between 2011 and 2014.
“They used to enter UP through Kathmandu. The government used to send them to Jammu-Kashmir like guests. But from the day Narendra Modi took oath as PM, such activities have stopped automatically at the border,” he added."

Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), one of the prominent Muslim organisations, has come out strongly against the government’s stand on triple talaq, insisting that there should be no interference “in the belief and religion of any citizen”.
In a statement, JIH chief Maulana Syed Jalaluddin Umari said Muslims consider divorce, polygamy and other personal laws as “an intrinsic part of their religion and are hence obliged to follow the Sharia in those matters”.

“The government should respect this position of Muslims, instead of conspiring to put an end to it,” he said.
Maintaining that attempts to “impose” a common civil code in the name of social reform and gender justice will prove “counterproductive”, he said, “The Constitution guarantees the freedom to profess, practice and propagate one’s own religion.”
“This inviolable freedom is given to every individual and enshrined as a fundamental right in our Constitution.”
The Centre had last week opposed the practice of triple talaq in the Supreme Court, maintaining that it cannot be regarded as an essential part of religion.

“Gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable,” the government had told the Apex Court in an affidavit in which it also held that “religious practices cannot be an impediment to rights and aspirations of individual woman irrespective of the religion she practices.”
Stressing that the government cannot force Muslims to follow other communities in issues related to personal laws, the Jamaat chief said it would amount to “infringement” on their fundamental rights.
“Those clamouring against triple talaq and demanding a ban on polygamy are a minuscule minority and are not representative of the Indian Muslim community,” he said, adding the government should respect this position of Muslims instead of “conspiring” to put an end to it.
“Jamaat-e-Islami Hind completely stands by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board which is the authentic representative body of Indian Muslims,” he said, adding all “major” Muslim organisations and a “vast majority” of the Muslim community stand solidly behind the Board and “will not accept any interference in their personal law.”
Asserting that those who are trying to “sow the seeds of dissension among Muslims will never succeed”, the Jamaat chief said, “The problem of triple talaq and polygamy has been blown out of proportion with the sole motive of portraying Muslims as being patriarchal and misogynistic.”
He claimed that the percentage of polygamy amongst Muslims is “negligible”.
“It is not mandatory for Muslims to practise polygamy but permission to have more than one wife does exist, albeit under certain conditions,” he said.
On the question of triple talaq, the JIH President said, “Most of the Islamic scholars accept pronouncement of triple talaq in one sitting as leading to a final and irrevocable divorce. However, if a person pronounces triple talaq in one sitting but says that he intended only a single divorce, then it will be treated likewise.”
“The ideal way of divorcing one’s wife is to pronounce talaqs one by one over a period of three months between her menstrual cycles, so that there is an opportunity for reconciliation between the spouses,” he said.
Besides, he said, a little known fact is that Islam allows a woman to get divorce through a process called “khula”. “If she is not happy with her marital life, she may return her alimony and demand separation. If the husband does not comply with her request, she may approach a ‘qazi’ (judge) who will help her to complete the divorce formalities,” he said.
Amid a raging debate on uniform civil code, the Law Commission has sought public views on the subject to revise and reform family laws, saying the aim is to address social injustice rather than plurality of laws."

Noted lyricist-poet Javed Akhtar today said that there should be an immediate ban on the practice of triple talaq but uniform civil code should be implemented only after proper discussion. When asked about his opinion on the topic that has been in the headlines, Akhtar said he has been vocal against the issue for many years.
“I have always spoken against these things. Triple talaq should be banned immediately in any civil society. As far as uniform common civil code is concerned, I am not sure how far this is possible because our country is huge,” he said while addressing a session at the Sahitya AajTak event.

Akhtar said India has many traditions, cultures and sub-cultures and bringing them under one law would be a mammoth task. “The government should make a draft of civil coade and put it on the net. There should be a draft, only then a discussion is possible. It should be disucssed for a year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If there is any discrepancy, then the Constitution must prevail and there should be no confusion about this.” The lyricist said politicians should remain silent on sensitive issues as they say right things with wrong intentions and weaken the cause.
Asked whether there was a danger to freedom of expression, Akhtar said that was not entirely true. “What happens is that when people take a stand… It sometimes is extreme but reality is somewhere in between. Some people say freedom of expression is over. That’s not true. I say whatever I feel like but it is also true that there are attempts against it.”
Taking potshots at extremists, Akhtar said, “Islam was always in danger but now Hindu religion is also in danger.” Akhtar said the scene in “Sholay” where Dharmendra woos Hema Malini by hiding himself behind the statue of Shiva would not be possible today."

“Suppose the wife falls sick (including periods), she cannot have sex and the husband will have to go to a sex worker. Islam says you cannot got to a sex worker. If you want, you can marry again,” Kondijal told a gathering of reporters when he was asked about his opinion on the uniform civil code.

The offensive and reactionary position taken by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board against reform of triple talaq is a reminder of the institutional cul de sac we have driven ourselves into on issues of personal law reform and common civil code. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s authority is itself dubious, and antithetical to the values and modes of reasoning of a progressive democracy. It represents the worst combination of a patriarchal, non-representative institution, shored up by the contingencies of electoral politics that often caves in to the most reactionary elements within communities. It marginalises other voices in the community, seems to have open contempt for women, and is, frankly, a political liability. It could, over the years, have been an instrument for progressive change, responding to demands from below within the community. Instead, it has chosen to act as a fossilised bulwark against justice.

Majoritarianism is a real issue. It is hard to discuss these issues when the risks of majoritarian intimidation are high. But the fear that discussions of personal law reform, or a common civil code, are nothing but majoritarian ruses to intimidate minorities, has now become an intellectually disabling and politically self-fulfilling argument. Often, arguments for a common civil code are made under false pretences of nationalism rather than justice. But that is, in part, because secular and progressive forces vacated that space. No one should underestimate the complexity of the issues involved in working towards a common civil code or equal rights.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Reactionary socially conservative positions of successive governments on a range of legal issues should give us pause on just how long the road to justice will be. The constant appeals by government to “our ethos” rather than public reason (most recently on the surrogacy bill), undermine confidence in the possibility of clear-headed normative arguments. But the AIMPLB’s recourse to specious religious arguments reinforces the legitimacy of ethos-based majoritarian arguments.
One conceptual move necessary to combat communal constructions is this. Every community, majority or minority, often appeals to the thought that something must not be imposed on them if they do not consent to it. The problem is that communities do not often extend the same courtesy to individuals within them. We have tied ourselves in knots trying to distinguish Indian secularism from its other variants, in castigating liberalism as a foreign ideology. But all that liberalism requires to get started is extending the courtesy of the very same argument that communities use to keep other communities out, to individuals within them. The freedom from another community cannot be the freedom to oppress within. As far as possible, we want to live under social arrangements that honour our standing as free and equal individuals. The battle in India is not between majorities and minorities. It is between forces and institutions in each community that want to bend the arc of history away from freedom and equality in the personal space, and forces that want to claim those rights. This is a contest that cuts across communities with varying degrees of intensity. But it is something of an own goal when secularists, rather than reconfiguring the debate as one between freedom and equality on the one hand and coercion and subordination on the other, also come to be invested in the contest of compulsory identities. The only way the long-term threat of majoritarianism can be dissolved is by moving the axis of contest away from the majority-minority distinction, to equal protection of individual rights, freedom and dignity. It is hard to imagine authorities like the AIMPLB even understanding this idea.
As Flavia Agnes, one of the most thoughtful and grounded contributors to this debate has pointed out, we must be wary of a lot of communal myth-making in this area. It is not only minorities who have been advocates of personal law. The Hindu Code Bill, with all its reform elements, was a sectarian reform aimed as much at consolidating a unified Hindu legal identity, as it was aimed at progressive social reform. Arguably the contractual framework for marriage in Islam can be more easily adapted to modern marriage laws than sacramental conceptions. Muslim personal law has also been subject to reform. Despite the cowardly abdication by the Congress in the Shah Bano affair, the Supreme Court has incrementally introduced reform, without opposition, it has to be said. (most notably in the Daniel Latifi case). So, arguably, there is propitious ground for serious, good faith conversation on the issue.
The conversation has to be oriented to the future. For this reason, its sole concern has to be freedom, equality and justice, not nationalism or selective narratives of which community was more oppressive in the past. It is high time we rescued that conversation from being held hostage by three forces: Bodies like the Muslim Personal Law Board that are non-representative and reactionary, Hindutva ideologies that are interested in using the issue to demonise minorities than to expand the space for freedom, and some secularists whose politics of fear has given them an investment in the war of identities rather than the expansion of rights.
The real challenge we should focus on is not the interplay between religion and law. No religious conception can have a veto over the transformative promise of the constitution. The challenge is crafting laws that in addition to being principled, are practical in the context of our state capacities and sociological realities. For instance, as Flavia Agnes has pointed out in her tour d’ force essay in the Oxford Handbook to the Indian Constitution, often reformed laws can have unintended consequences. Outlawing does not seem to have had as much effect on the actual practice of bigamy among Hindus as was hoped, for instance; indeed, the law perversely fails to give protection to people in these relationships because it does not recognise them. In other areas of law, we have also seen the limits of law induced change; often expecting the law to do too much can be counterproductive. Law is effective only when society meets it at least half-way. The real reform debate should not be over one community’s virtues versus the others; it should be about closing the gap between the demands of freedom and equality and social practice.
Whether equal rights within different laws responds to this challenge better than a common civil code, can be debated. But the goal of freedom for all individuals is the best antidote to majoritarianism. We need conversations, institutions, processes that move us in that direction, not trap us in suffocating constructs of majority and minority."

STATING THAT some people are “silent” on the issue of triple talaq, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday compared it to the silence of those present during the “cheer haran” of Draupadi in the Mahabharata.
“Desh ki ek jwalant samasya par jo log munh band kiye hue hain… mujhe wo yaad aata hai jab Draupadi ka cheer haran hota hai… Draupadi ne bhari sabha se prashn poochha tha ki aakhir is ghatna, is paap ka doshi kaun hai… Koi bol nahi paya tha… Tab Vidur ne kaha tha ki tihai doshi wo hain jo apradhi hain… tihai doshi wo hain jo unke sahyogi hain…. aur tihai doshi wo hain jo maun hain…” (There are people who are silent over a burning issue of the country. This reminds me of when Draupadi was forcibly disrobed)
She asked the gathering who was responsible for the sin. Nobody was able to say anything. Then Vidur said one-third of the blame was to put on the offenders, one-third on their associates, and one-third on those who remained silent),” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Stating that there should be the same law for all citizens, he said the common civil code is “necessary” and “in the country’s interest”.
Adityanath was speaking at an event to mark the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. He said Chandra Shekhar was also in favour of a common civil code.
Last week, Adityanath had announced that the state government would present its stand, “formed on the basis of Muslim women’s opinion”, to the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions related to the issue.
The chief minister had also asked for formulating a work plan to collect the views of Muslim women on the issue, and directed the ministers of concerned departments as well as all women ministers to hold meetings with women groups on the issue.
Meanwhile, a book on Chandra Shekhar’s speeches in Parliament was released on the occasion. The event was organised by Chandra Shekhar Ji Smarak Trust, managed by SP MLC Yashwant Singh. Kunda MLA and cabinet minister in the previous Samajwadi Party government, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, was also present on the occasion.
Adityanath said he was surprised when Yashwant invited him. “When he came to me, I asked him if he had made a mistake. But he said he wanted me to unveil this Hindi version,” he said."

Stating that absence of reforms in the community in the last 65 years have left Muslim women “extremely vulnerable, both socially as well as financially”, the Centre on Friday impressed upon the Supreme Court to do away with the practice of polygamy and triple talaq. The Centre also said these practices “cannot be regarded as essential or integral part of the religion”.

The affidavit, submitted by the Union Law Ministry in response to a clutch of petitions challenging polygamy and triple talaq, said that the validity of these practices required a “reconsideration” by the top court “in light of the principle of gender justice and overriding principle of non-discrimination, dignity and equality” as well as “evolution of women”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The government maintained that triple talaq and polygamy impacted a woman’s status and her right to live with confidence and dignity, and added that they were not protected under Article 25 of the Constitution, which guaranteed immunity to practices essential or integral to the religion.
“Even theocratic states have undergone reform in this area of law and, therefore, in a secular republic like India, there is no reason to deny the rights available under the Constitution. The fact that Muslim countries where Islam is the State Religion have undergone extensive reforms goes to establish that the practices in question cannot be regarded as integral to practices of Islam,” it said.
The affidavit gave a list of 10 countries with sizeable Muslim population to argue that laws on polygamy and divorce there had been codified and were regulated accordingly.
Pointing out that personal laws were meant to preserve plurality and diversity, the ministry questioned whether preservation of diverse identities could be “a pretext for denying to women the status and gender equality”.
“Secularism being a hallmark of Indian democracy, no part of its citizenry ought to be denied access to fundamental rights, much less can a section of secular society be worse off than its counterparts in theocratic countries, many of which have undergone reform,” it said.
The ministry requested the court to reconsider the legal position settled by a judgment of the Bombay High Court in 1951, which had held that personal laws were absolutely immune and could not be struck down by the courts on the grounds of being inconsistent or in derogation of fundamental rights.
The ministry claimed that personal laws as well as customs and usage would come under the ambit of Article 13, which lays down that any law that impinges upon fundamental rights shall be void. The government pleaded that the practices of triple talaq and polygamy should be tested on the anvil of Article 13 after rectifying the “incorrect” precedent set by the High Court in 1951.
The affidavit said that although the 1951-judgment had upheld the validity of polygamy, it had also underscored the need for social reforms. It added that no reform had happened in the last 65 years and that women from the Muslim community remained extremely vulnerable.
“Even though it may be true that only some women are directly and actually affected by the practices of triple talaq and polygamy, the fact remains that every woman to whom the said law applies lives under the threat, fear or prospect of being subjected to these practices, which in turn impacts her status and her right to live with confidence and dignity,” it said.
“The practice of polygamy was regarded as progressive and path-breaking centuries ago but with the evolution of women and principle of gender justice, these required serious reconsideration… Even an affidavit by the Muslim Personal Law Board has referred to those practices as ‘undesirable’, which cannot be elevated to essential religious practice, much less one that forms the substratum of religion,” said the ministry, whose response will be examined by the court on October 18.
The Muslim Personal Law Board, in its reply to the petitions, had defended the validity of triple talaq saying that if the practice is discontinued, a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her.
“If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive,” the AIMPLB’s affidavit had stated. The board had also said that divorce proceedings instead of triple talaq could damage a woman’s chances of re-marriage if the husband accuses her of loose character in court."

She accused the PM of harassing the females by making them stand in queues during demonetisation.
Earlier Rahul also slammed the government for demonetisation, demanding that farmers loan should be waived off. “PM Modi remembers farmers only during election time,” he said at the rally where his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present. With two days to go for the third phase of elections in Uttar Pradesh, war of words continued between BJP, Congress-SP alliance and the BSP on Thursday. Leaders from all the major parties held rallies and press conferences to attack the opposition and woo the voters.
Here are the highlights:
05.09 pm: PM has done nothing for his constituency Varanasi, he made hollow promises, says Priyanka

03.55 pm:  PM Modi keeps saying ‘Make in India’, but everywhere I see its ‘Made in China’. He gives the money only to 50 families, says Rahul
03.53 pm: PM Modi makes relationships and then makes people stand in queues, says Rahul
03.50 pm: PM Modi makes empty promises, govt not doing enough for farmers, says Rahul
03.46 pm: Wherever he goes he makes relationships. He went to Varanasi and said ‘I’m the son of Varanasi’. The PM had promised he would clean Ganga, would install solar lamps, free internet, would make Bhojpuri film city in Varanasi, says Rahul
03.45 pm: PM Modi is not interested in the pains and sufferings of the farmers, says Rahul Gandhi
03.42 pm: PM Modi says the moment BJP forms govt in UP, we will waive off loans of the farmers. Narendra Modi you are the PM, you can waive off the farmers’ loans in 15 minutes, says Rahul Gandhi

02: 26 pm: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Fatehpur on Friday asked PM Modi to live up to his poll promises. “Prime Minister Modi promised us Achhe Din. We were shown Dilwale Dulhania the movie. 2.5 years later, we saw Gabbar Singh come out,” Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi addresses Congress rally at Fatehpur. Criticising PM Modi’s remark of calling himself as an adopted son of the state, Gandhi said the relationships are formed only if you live up to them. “Modiji rishtay bolne se, jataane se nahi bante hain, nibhaane se bante hain (Modiji, relations are not formed just by saying, neither are they formed just by epressing. You have to live up to them),” he said.

(Photo for representational purpose)
On October 7, the union government filed its gingerly-worded affidavit in the Supreme Court supporting a ban on talaq-e-bidat, nikah halala and polygamy. The caution it exercised in not mentioning the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), however, came undone the same day when the Law Commission issued a questionnaire eliciting public opinion on “the viability of a uniform civil code”. Anchored in the issue of women’s rights, the stated objective of the survey is to end discrimination against vulnerable groups, and the need to “harmonise the various cultural practices”.

While criticism by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which has taken an adversarial position even in the triple talaq case, is no surprise, many of the progressive proponents of reforms within the community too have been wary of broaching the subject of the UCC. Muslim scholars have often been critical of the very binary choice offered to the community between maintaining status quo and accepting a UCC steeped in a majoritarian value-system.
If gender justice was indeed the concern, the union government didn’t have to look very far for solutions. While hearing the Shayara Banu plea against triple talaq, the apex court had in March directed the Centre to place before it the report of the high level committee on Status of Women in India (2015). This voluminous report by the Pam Rajput panel lies forgotten with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, which had commissioned it, and is yet to be placed before the Supreme Court.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The report straddles the fine line between ensuring gender justice and maintaining the plurality of family laws. It reiterates the need to protect diversity, and rejects uniformity as a way to push for women’s rights.
“The approach should be not one of ensuring that there is one law for all, but rather, that all women, whether they choose to be governed by secular laws or their personal laws, enjoy equality which the Indian Constitution promises them. This requires addressing several aspects in the legal domain in specific ways rather than a diktat of ‘uniformity’, which is conceived of in fundamentalist/majoritarian ways,” the report states.
The report’s relevance extends far beyond the stand it takes against triple talaq and polygamy. Using the prism of gender equality, it recommends reforms in personal laws of all communities in matters of marriage, divorce, custody and succession. Carrying forward the debate first triggered by the landmark Shah Bano judgment of 1985, the report asserts that Muslim law must be reformed to make it mandatory to provide maintenance to wife and children during marriage, separation or divorce. It points out that the state needs to recognise the unpaid contribution of women to their families, and faults the Hindu Marriage Act for being the only one that also gives husbands the right to claim maintenance. This should be done away with, it states, as should be the provision where payment of maintenance can be stopped to a deserving wife if she has been “unchaste” post separation.
The panel also asks for reform of Muslim succession laws wherein a daughter gets only half the share of the son. At the same time, it acknowledges the superiority of Muslim law in aspects such as ensuring that the daughter is not disinherited — the law limits the right to will away property to only a third of the total. The report argues for insertion of similar safeguards in the Hindu Succession Act under which, in practice, women often get a raw deal.
It recommends that the 2-year separation period for divorce by mutual consent for Christians should be shortened to 1 year as is the case with most others. The panel observes that under Hindu law, “cruelty” as a ground for divorce must be clearly defined to put an end to patriarchal notions of “cruelty” dictating court judgments.
Its stress on the UCC notwithstanding, the Law Commission’s questionnaire does seek opinion on Christian divorce laws, the Muslim triple talaq and polygamy, and maitri karaar (friendship deed), a practice that disadvantages Hindu women in Gujarat by allowing their men to enter into bigamous relationships. However, it leaves out crucial questions such as whether the Hindu Undivided Family would be willing to give up the unique tax exemption that it enjoys. In fact, even under the secular Special Marriage Act, exemption is granted to Hindu couples in matters of succession so as to keep this entitlement intact. The Pam Rajput panel recommends that not only should this benefit be done away with, the revenue thus generated could be for used for the welfare of women.
The current debate on triple talaq arises from the fact that the Muslim personal law is not codified, but is based on the wider framework of the Shariat. Many blame this absence of codification for the negation or dilution of rights that were traditionally granted to women. A case in point is how talaq-e-bidat (unilateral, instantaneous divorce given by men) has no foundation in the Quran or Hadith (utterances of the Prophet). Muslim scholar Tahir Mahmood traces its origin to the time when the first caliph Abu Bakr allowed it once so as to grant instant divorce to a few women who no longer wanted to stay with their husbands. The religious orthodoxy continues to uphold the sanctity of such practices as “bad in theology but good in law”.
Among the Muslim women’s groups that oppose the UCC but are proponents of personal law reforms, there are two divergent views. Those such as the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan insist on codification to pre-empt hegemonic interpretations by the clergy. Groups such as Bebaak Collective ask for reforms while shunning attempts at codification as, according to them, it will fail to address the “multiple realities of an identity, multiple practices of beliefs and pluralist envisions of family structure”.
Feminist writer Nivedita Menon has shown how the Hindu code bill codified vast heterogeneous practices and brought them in conformity with Hindu upper caste practices, often to the detriment of both diversity and the rights of women. For example, the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, nullified the superior position of daughters in matrilineal communities. The Pam Rajput panel report subscribes to this view. It takes a stand against codification of Muslim law on the grounds that it will “affect its flexibility which may be against the interest of women”, and argues instead for amending existing laws “to include progressive reforms in line with constitutional values like equality and justice”."

The unfolding drama over the issues of triple talaq, halala marriage and polygamy, in and outside the Supreme Court of India, opens up the larger question of whether the Islam of the mullahs and muftis is at odds with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, personal liberty and free choice enshrined in the Indian Constitution. One often hears the reigning high priests of Indian Islam proclaim: We believe in Islam and we also have faith in the Indian Constitution. In practice, this often shows up as divided loyalty. This is evident in the current debate as it was in the Haji Ali dargah controversy earlier. Equally apparent is the emerging idea of Islam which is in conflict with the Islam of the orthodox but in consonance with constitutional values. Some Muslims talk of “our Islam” vs “their Islam”.

In the Haji Ali dargah case, two Muslim women activists had petitioned the Bombay High Court asserting both their constitutional and Islamic rights to equal access, on par with men, to the sanctum sanctorum. The trustees claimed their 2011-12 decision restricting women’s access was in accordance with Shariah law and therefore part of their constitutionally guaranteed right to religious freedom. In July this year, the high court ruled in favour of the women activists. An appeal by the dargah’s trustees is now before the Supreme Court, which has asked them to come up with a “progressive solution”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The same conflict between orthodox Islam and the constitution is now in evidence with the petition of a Muslim woman victim of instant divorce from Uttarakhand, Shayara Bano, pending before the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of and declaration of triple talaq, halala marriage and polygamy as unconstitutional.
Two other Muslim women — Afreen Rehman (Rajasthan) Ishrat Jahan (West Bengal) — and three Muslim women’s organisations — Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), Bebaak Collective and All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) — have lined up alongside Shayara Bano in the apex court. Outside the court, a group calling itself “Muslim men for gender justice” collected nearly 150 signatures in a day from over three dozen cities across the country in support of the women petitioners. Significantly, while the Bebaak Collective (a joint platform of several Muslim women’s groups), is focused on triple talaq, halala marriage and polygamy being declared unconstitutional, BMMA is hoping for a verdict which also deems these practices as “un-Islamic”.

Ranged against them is the All India Muslim Personal Law Board which has filed an affidavit staunchly defending triple talaq and polygamy, arguing that the apex court must not interfere in Muslim personal law. The Board is backed by the Jamiatul-ulema, the Jamaat-e-Islami and other Muslim bodies. What has provided extra charge to the orthodox position is the fact of the Muslim-unfriendly Modi government filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court which supports the women petitioners. To them this is nothing but the first step towards enacting a uniform civil code on Indian Muslims in keeping with the sangh parivar’s long-standing agenda.
In the past, while dealing with cases where a litigant invoked the right to freedom of religion (Article 25), the Supreme Court has based its verdicts on whether the practice in question was “an integral and essential part of [the] religion [concerned]”. The Board and its supporters insist that triple talaq and polygamy are “an integral and essential part of Islam”. What’s more, it is claimed that Shariah law is God-given and therefore immutable.
If such be the case, how is it that, forget Shias, even the Sunni Ahl-e-Hadith sect in India, considers triple talaq unacceptable? How has instant divorce been declared unlawful, polygamy banned or made conditional in many Muslim-majority countries? Is it not a fact that the entire Shariah corpus — compilation of opinions and rulings based on interpretations of the Quran and Ahadith — is man-made?
Why are Sunni ulema hell-bent on defending the continuance of triple talaq which is not only contrary to the unambiguous Quran injunction, but which even according to them is “theologically repugnant”? What, except their male-centred worldview, stops them from seeing the two-faceted nature of the Quranic stipulations concerning women: Some truly progressive by the prevailing cultural sensibilities at Islam’s birth, some like “directive principles” pointing towards a far more egalitarian and gender just future society?
Will the Supreme Court revert to the “essentiality” criterion in the present case? Or should it refrain from stepping on this “slippery slope” and limit itself, as some legal luminaries suggest, to the position that the constitutional right to freedom of religion (Article 25) is subservient to the equality, non-discrimination and personal liberty principles that precede it?
Which approach the apex court adopts remains to be seen. But one thing is clear. The centuries-old Muslim male monopoly over the interpretation of Islam is under serious challenge. Across the globe, an increasing number of Muslim women and men are now doing their own reading of religious texts and coming to the same conclusion. That the core values enshrined in the Quran are consonant with the fundamental rights and freedoms embedded in the Indian Constitution, as also the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948. The real conflict today, then, is between their “our Islam” and the supremacist, misogynist “their Islam” of the patriarchs.
Islamic scholar Aziza Hibri keeps it simple: “Where there is no justice, there is no Islam”. Let the Board and its ardent supporters explain to the Supreme Court and the rest of us how triple talaq and polygamy practices are egalitarian or just."

The Jamat-e-Islami Hind, a socio-cultural organisation, on Monday asked political parties not to politicise the practice of triple talaq among the Muslims.
“Talaq is a social issue and it should not be made into a political issue to suit their (political parties’) agenda,” Hasan Raza, member of the central advisory committee of the JIH, told reporters at Ahmedabad.
Raza said people, including the Muslims, had little understanding of the nuances and intricacies of triple talaq. For this, the JIH has launched an awareness campaign accross the country from April 23 to May 7, 2017, he said.
He appealed to political parties not to spread confusion and misunderstanding in the society over the issue of triple talaq. “It is social issue rather than a political issue for pursuing vote bank politics. Please do not create confusion in society by politicising it but educate people, including Hindus about triple talaq”, he said. In Gujarat, the JIH plans to reach out to 10 lakh people as part of the awareness campaign through nukkad meetings, public talks and distribution of literature about the Muslim personal law, said JIH Gujarat head Shakil Rajput. He said JIH volunteers would visit slum pockets to educate the poor."

The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee’s (GPCC) minority cell will be submitting memorandum to all the 33 districts collectors on October 20 to oppose the government’s interference in Muslim Personal Law and bring in a uniform civil code (UCC) in the country. Minority cell president Gulab Khan Rayma said that the memorandum addressed to President of India would be submitted to the collectors, with a request to forward it the President.

He said that there was a lot of apprehension in the Muslim community over the central government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court on the issue of triple ‘talaq’ (divorce) and the people felt that it was a move to bring in the uniform civil code in the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rayma said that Muslim community was totally against any interference in their personal laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, succession, inheritance and other issues. He said that there was a lot of religious and cultural diversity in the country and people had been living in peace and harmony while respecting each other’s culture and tradition.
“There is no need of a uniform civil code at all and people be allowed to follow their religion and culture without any interference,” he said. Meanwhile, various Muslim social organisations are conducting a signature campaign saying they don’t want any changes in the Muslim personal law. These signatures would be sent to Law Commission of India, which has issued a questionnaire to get people’s response on triple ‘talaq’."

Roughly, the Shariat can be explained as the provisions in the Quran as well as the teachings and practices of Prophet Mohammad. However, the origin, evolution and the applicability of the Shariat is far more twisted than that. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution grants “equal protection of law” to all its citizens. But when it comes to personal issues(marriage, divorce, inheritance, custody of children,etc), Muslims in India are governed by the Muslim Personal Law which came into force in 1937. What exactly is the Muslim Personal Law, how did it originate and why has the Indian government faced difficulties in granting equality of marital status to Indian Muslim women, these are questions that IndianExpress.com tries to answer.
How did the Shariat originate?
Before Islam was introduced as a religion to Arabia, a tribal social structure prevailed there. The tribe as a whole determined what was law and the rules were unwritten. These laws modified with time, as and when society felt the need for change. By the seventh century, the Muslim community got established in Medina and soon started spreading to the surrounding regions. With the establishment of Islam, the will of God, as transmitted in the Quran as the revelations of Muhammad, came to supersede every tribal custom. These writings in the Quran along with unwritten customs, also known as the Shariat is what governs Islamic society. Additionally, the Shariat is also based on the Hadith (actions and words of the Prophet as recorded by his companions). Originally, they were very broad and general solutions to practical problems in society.
How did the Shariat evolve over time?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It would be a huge mistake to argue that the Shariat has remained static over centuries, as the immutable word of God as established in the seventh century. During the period when the Prophet was alive, the legislation mentioned in the Quran kept developing in response to practical problems faced by the Prophet and his community. After his death too, the presence of different schools of Sharia and the way different modern Islamic countries have applied it to their legal domain, is evidence of the capacity in the Islamic law to be interpreted and developed in ways meeting the needs of society.
There are four different schools of Islamic law, each of which interprets the writings in the Quran in different ways and consists of varying rules and regulations for the Islamic community world over. The four schools (Hanafiyya, Malikiyya, Shafiyya and Hanabaliyya) developed in four different centuries. Countries with Muslim population have each adopted their Islamic laws based upon one of these schools depending upon their specific situation.
Accordingly, modern Islamic nation states have responded to the needs of modernity by embracing the Shariat in ways suiting their social and political needs. For instance, Egypt responded to the calls of modernity in the late nineteenth century by extending secular laws based upon theories drawn from the West. In Saudi Arabia on the other hand, the Islamic law, as interpreted by the Hanabali Shafiyya school of thought, is strictly followed.
How was the Muslim law applied in India?
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act was passed in 1937 with the aim to formulate an Islamic law code for Indian Muslims. The British who were at this point in time governing India, were trying to ensure that Indians be ruled according to their own cultural norms. When it came to distinguishing between laws made for the Hindus and those for the Muslims, they laid out the statement that “clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law” in the case of Hindus. For the Muslims on the other hand, the writings in the Quran would be of foremost importance. Since 1937 therefore, the Shariat Application Act mandates aspects of Muslim social life such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and family relations. The Act lays out that in matters of personal dispute the State shall not interfere.
Are personal laws specific to Muslims in India?
Such legislations have been made over the years for other religious groups in India as well, thereby framing separate civil codes for different religions in the country. For instance, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 which lays out guidelines for property inheritance among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1936 lays out rules to be followed by the Parsis according to their religious traditions. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 had codified laws related to marriage among Hindus. In face, in 1955 this Act had been amended to include laws on divorce and separation which were previously not part of it.
Apart from these separate civil codes related to marriage, there exists a Special Marriage Act as well which was last amended in 1954. It lays out provisions for marital laws irrespective of the religion to which the persons concerned belong. Muslims too can get married under this law.
Is the Shariat Application Act in India unchangeable?
The applicability of the Shariat Act has come under controversy in the past as well. There have been previous instances when the issue of protection of women’s rights as part of the broader fundamental rights came into conflict with religious rights. Most well known among these is the Shah Bano case. In 1985, 62-year-old Shah Bano, filed a lawsuit, seeking alimony from her former husband. The Supreme Court, in this case, had held up her right to alimony, but the judgment was vehemently opposed by the Islamic community who considered it to be going against the written rules in the Quran. The case triggered a controversy regarding the extent to which courts can interfere into personal/religious laws. The Congress government which was then in power, passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce Act), which made it necessary for the husband to pay alimony to his wife, but only during the period of iddat, that is 90 days after divorce.
There have been plenty of instances of protests against personal laws. One of the prime agendas of the women’s movement in India since the 1930s has been the discrimination faced by women in personal laws, across all religions. Earlier in March this year, Justice B. Kemal Pasha, a sitting Judge of the Kerala High Court had made a strong protest against Muslim women being denied equal rights under the Muslim Personal Law. However, voices of protest against reforms in the personal laws has made it extremely difficult to make amends.
The Shariat Application Act in India protects the application of Islamic laws in personal legal relationships, but the Act does not define the laws. It clearly states that in matters of personal disputes, the State shall not interfere and a religious authority would pass a declaration based on his interpretations of the Quran and the Hadith. Given this background of the matter it is difficult to have it undergo changes since it raises the question, to what extent should the State (which is supposed to be secular) interfere with the personal affairs of the civilians. While the protection of the rights of women has been called into time and again in such cases, “majority of those practising Islam consider the laws of the Shariat to be completely correct and so they cannot be subjected to legislative changes considering the fact that freedom of religion, practices and so on, are part of fundamental rights,” says practising lawyer M.R. Shamshad."

Accusing the BJP-led government of “trying to flare up communal passions” in the country, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday said imminent defeat of BJP in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will act as “people’s triple talaq” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “They are fighting against triple talaq and in favour of uniform civil code. Modi and BJP too will face triple talaq in the coming elections in Uttar Pradesh. The people of the country will give them triple talaq.

“First it was Delhi assembly elections where they faced a humiliating defeat. This was the first talaq. Then it was Bihar where they were defeated and it was second Talaq. The third talaq of the masses will be the defeat of BJP and Hindutva forces in UP elections,” Yechury said while addressing a rally here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Since this BJP government came to power, the communal forces have increased their activities by leaps and bounds and they are trying to flare up communal passions across the country,” he said.
Yechury said that Modi had pushed the country towards “financial anarchy” by the decision of demonetisation. He has failed to bring back black money stashed abroad.
“The country’s economy has gone for a toss. The country has been pushed towards financial anarchy by this decision of demonetisation. The entire economy has been badly hit, first it was only small scale industries, now the big and medium scale industries are also getting affected,” Yechury said.
“Even after two-and-half years in the government, Modi is yet to keep his promise of bringing back black money stashed abroad. They have failed to keep their promise and now they have come with this demonetisation to help the rich in transforming their black money into white,” he added."

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday termed triple talaq a “burning” issue and said in a developing country like India, women cannot be treated as “secondary” citizens. He also favoured wide discussions on the contentious issue of ‘Uniform Civil Code’ and said in case a consensus emerges, nobody should have any problem with it as even the framers of the Constitution wanted that the state shall “endeavor” to implement it to empower every citizen.

“Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar had assured everyone’s empowerment in the Constitution, be it women or anyone else… You must be agreeing with the fact that in a developing nation, we cannot leave women behind. We can not treat women as secondary citizens. This is not possible in any progressive society,” Singh said.
“Triple talaq is a burning issue of this time…. Is it in accordance of Article 44 of the Constitution? Only court will decide this,” he said at the Constitution Day celebration held at Patiala House Courts complex here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“At times when there is a debate about triple talaq, some people say that there is an effort to impose Uniform Civil Code (UCC) on them. But as far as UCC is concerned, it is discussed in the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) of the Constitution,” Singh said.
Referring to the DPSP, he said, “the state shall endeavour to implement Uniform Civil Code for its citizens.” “I believe that there should be a discussion at national level… There should be a series of discussions on the issue and if there is any consensus, then, I think no one should have any problem,” he said.
The Union minister also said the government is mulling over the proposal of a National Litigation Policy which would help in reducing pendency of cases. Referring to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) he said it will bring a regime of ‘one nation, one tax’. He also took a dig at the imposition of Emergency, when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister, and said the period showed as what happens when fundamental rights are curbed and crushed."

A MAJORITY of those who had responded to its questionnaire on a uniform civil code, including many Muslims organisations, have opposed spontaneous triple talaq, Law Commission chairperson Justice B S Chauhan has said.
The commission is currently examining the more than 40,000 responses it has received to the questionnaire issued in October 2016.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Justice Chauhan said the larger consensus was that spontaneous triple talaq, as is currently practised, was not in keeping with what was stated in the Shariat, which mandates a three-month iddat period meant for reconciliation and arbitration.

“While we are yet to tabulate the huge number of responses, one thing we have observed is that most people, even among the Muslims, have opposed the practice of spontaneous triple talaq. They have held that iddat period should be observed,” said Chauhan.
The ‘Questionnaire on Uniform Civil Code’ was issued by the law panel around the same time that the Union government filed its response in a Supreme Court case opposing instantaneous triple talaq, and had generated much controversy due to its timing. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board carried out its own mass signature drive and sent it to the Law Commission, opposing any inference in the Shariat even if it is to outlaw the practice of instantaneous triple talaq which is not as prescribed in the Muslim personal law.
Considering the overwhelming response, the Law Commission had extended the deadline for feedback on the questionnaire until the end of December 2016.
Chauhan said, “In December, Justice Mohammad Mustaq of the Kerala High Court delivered a judgment examining the validity of triple talaq and sent it to the Law Commission, referring the matter to us. Those who have been alleging that this exercise carries forward the government’s agenda should understand that with the court order, we are bound to examine the matter now.”
The high court judgment, favouring codification of Muslim divorce laws, held, “The empirical finding establishes that triple talaq as practised in India in almost all the case(s) is not by following Qur’anic injunctions and such practices are allowed in the name of religion, without its backing. The only way out for the State is to find out the meaning of rationale of the personal law and to regulate divorce in accordance with the purpose of law.”
At the same time, Chauhan clarified that the commission is not only looking at triple talaq but at the issue of gender justice in personal laws of all religions, in terms of marriage, divorce, child custody and property rights. “Why are we only talking of triple talaq? Except for certain matriarchal societies, such as those in parts of the Northeast, most women still have no right to agricultural land. We will be looking at gender justice in all aspects of personal law. Never before in India has any law commission sought responses from people. This was a first-of-its-kind experiment. In any developed country, law is made after consultation with stakeholders. After all, enforcement of law depends upon acceptability of law,” he said."

As a result, she was barred from going to the University and consigned to washing dishes at home. Barely 16, Safia, a brilliant student of class ten, had her marriage fixed to a man almost triple her age. Safia could not continue her studies. Fauzia, a graduate from Delhi University’s Lady Shri Ram College, joined a computer programming course. When her parents insisted on marriage, she committed suicide.
The rate of literacy among Muslim women is as low as 90 per cent. The responsibility for this doesn’t lie with Islam as much as pointed by the western media but with the Muslim men who have curtailed most of the rights of their women even ordained by the holy Quran. Regarding imparting education to women, it becomes very clear with Ibn-e-Ma’aja a Hadith that Talabulilmi farizatun al kulli Muslimeen meaning that it is the duty of every Muslim man and woman to attain knowledge equally. But Muslim men have often proved themselves as arrogant, obscurantist and narrow minded.
Muslim women in India are also handicapped owing to the dictates of Muslim Personal Law that is not scriptural in nature and the conservative ulema who have interpreted them in a very orthodox manner. Shariat Law that came into being during the time of the British in 1937, is outdated. At the time of Prophet Mohammed, women were exhorted to act as Imams and lead congregational prayers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
One has heard Muslim men casting the decree of talaq on matters like the favourite dish, the colour of the suit worn by women or simply sharing the responsibility to look after a small child. Talaq-e-Bidat is the one that is ordained in one sitting. Talaq-e-Sharia is the one that aims at spacing the entire process over a period of three months. It is Talaq-e-Bidat that has been the real culprit behind breaking of many families.
Prophet Mohammed abhorred divorce. Even a Muslim can seek divorce from her husband, nevertheless such cases are far and few. Firstly, through mutual agreement between husband and wife which is known as Khulaa, and secondly, through a court of law. It will be seen that the wife is not at liberty as the husband to get herself released by an outright declaration of divorce. If her husband refuses to grant her divorce, she can go to a law court and obtain a decree in her favour. 
This may seem to place her at a disadvantage in comparison to her husband, and this may be asserted that this implies the inequality of rights, as between husband and wife. Here, actually the intervention of the State in the matter is a device for the fuller protection of her rights. Islam has unreservedly condemned men and women who use their legal rights of divorce on any except legitimate grounds and in absolutely unbearable conditions.
In Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey, laws have been made that if a person wants to remarry, he has to take the permission from the court. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is in favour of laying down the condition for remarrying that the permission of the first wife should be a must. 
The votaries for polygamy in the Board feel that such a condition should not be laid as the first wife will never permit her husband to go in for a second one! They are the hypocritical ones who feel that this will be a direct intervention in Sharia laws. 
Because of the increasing incidents of polygamy, the Islamic court of Dar-ul-Qaza, has laid down the condition that polygamy will be allowed only if a person shows sufficient cause for it and satisfies the authorities that he will be able to bear the additional economic burden or not subsequently divorce.

The Law Commission questionnaire on uniform civil code has received a whopping 40,000 plus responses which continue to pour in even after the expiry of the deadline. While the deadline to send the responses ended last night, the law panel on Thursday said it would continue to entertain responses received after the deadline. Highly-placed sources in the panel said so far over 40,000 responses have been received.

“Uniform Civil Code is one of the important projects before the Law Commission. The responses/replies received by the Commission are being processed. The response/replies received, if any, after the date may also be considered,” it said in a brief statement. On October 7, the panel had sought public view on uniform civil code and triple talaq.
The All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had slammed the questionnaire, saying it was uncalled for. Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished and whether a uniform civil code should be optional, the Law Commission had asked the public seeking response on these sensitive issues. Amid a raging debate on uniform civil code, the law panel had sought public views on the subject to revise and reform family laws, saying the aim is to address social injustice and its not against plurality of laws.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Commission said the objective behind the endeavour is to address discrimination against vulnerable groups and harmonise the various cultural practices even as it assured the people the “norms of no one class, group or community will dominate the tone and tenor of family law reforms”. In an accompanying questionnaire, the Commission had asked whether the existing personal laws and customary practices need codification and whether it would benefit people.
Should the practice of triple talaq be abolished, retained or retained with suitable amendments; and whether a uniform civil code should be optional are among 16 queries by the commission."

A week after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked women ministers of his government to gather opinion of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq through social organisations that would be placed before the apex court, the exercise formally began in Lucknow on Wednesday. While many social activists refused to accept the recommendations of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board made in Lucknow saying that the board cannot act like “khap panchayats”, they also pointed out that social boycott was not the solution to triple talaq.
These organisations also asked the government to take up the issue of education and social security of Muslim women along with merely taking opinion on triple talaq. Representatives of telecom companies were also called to the meeting to take their suggestions regarding use of technology for conducting the survey in this regard and more such meetings are expected before the questionnaire and survey is given final shape.
“The exercise should not be seen as an interference in personal law. We are addressing the issue of equal rights of women, assuring them that wherever their rights would be suppressed, we would stand by them,” said Rita Bahuguna Joshi, adding that women alleged that the 5 crore signatures being claimed by AIMPLB in support of non-interference into personal law were based on vague questions like whether one supports the Shariat law or not, and whether one supports the Muslim Personal Law Board or not.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We would also take up long-term issues about social security of women, and the working group would sit for more hours to finalise step-by-step procedure to be adopted in this regard,” added Joshi. Social activists, who participated in the meet, were more aggressive in their demands, citing that such provisions had been abolished even in countries like Pakistan, Morocco, Indonesia and even Saudi Arabia.
“Shariat and Shariat law should not be confused. While Shariat is mention in the Quran, Shariat law is man-made by people based on their interpretation. There are several countries, including our neighbours like Pakistan and even Saudi Arabia, where such law does not exist. So why in India?” said Naish Hasan, a social activist working on Muslim women rights.Lucknow NewsClose aide of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari held in ambulance case‘Abducted’ Aligarh girl found living on rent in BulandshahrCovid resurgence: With nearly 4,000 cases a day, patient count climbs to 22,820Click here for more
Shaista Ambar, the president of All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board who was also attended the meeting, said, “The AIMPLB should not act like some khap panchayat. They have no right to force their decisions or recommendations on anyone. It is the decision of the court and the Parliament, which is finally accepted. Moreover, in the name of defending the law, three months counseling period mentioned in the Shariat cannot be overlooked.”"

Days after Law Commission released a questionnaire asking for answers and suggestions from stakeholders and general public regarding the Article 44 of Indian Constitution which speaks about Uniform Civil Code, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board – a non-government organisation – on Thursday slammed the Central government. The board alleged that Law Commission’s move was influenced by the government and that it was performing as an organ of the government.

AIMPLB chief Wali Rehmani addressed the media and said: “Muslims will boycott law commission questionnaire, it is performing as an organ of the government.” He further added that the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is violative of the Constitution and the right to religion provided by it to every Indian.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Rehmani also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that the move was an attempt to divert public’s attention from failure of 30 months of the government’s functioning. “They cannot protect India’s borders and seem to be fueling internal strife,” he said.
The members also claimed that Hindus practiced polygamy more than Muslims and also that the cases of divorce were more among Hindus as per the census.

The AIMPLB’s statement comes after Law Commission released a questionnaire on October 7 which included 16 questions regarding the relevance and need of UCC, its impact on women’s development, triple talaq among other things.
The questionnaire comes in the backdrop of a case being heard in Supreme Court regarding the relevance of triple talaq. The case was filed by one Shayara Bano who challenged the practice and her petition was later merged with similar petitions by other organisations including the Bhartiya Muslim Mahina Andolan.

When THE SUPREME Court of India upheld the validity of police bans on the Anand Margi practice of performing tandava nritya, community leaders saw in it denial of their constitutionally protected right to religious freedom. The same was the reaction of Jain saints when the Rajasthan High Court last year declared illegal the practice of santhara. And, now the provision for religious freedom under the Constitution is being invoked by Muslim theologians opposing the petitions of some divorced Muslim girls in the apex court seeking a ban on what is called “triple talaq”. These and many other similar cases point out to a mistaken belief in the society that the Constitution furnishes a blanket protection to all sorts of archaic social practices bearing a religious tagline.
Watch what else is making news

In Part III of the Constitution, which assures people certain fundamental rights, Article 25 proclaims that “all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion”. What people fail to notice is that this proclamation is prefixed with the words “subject to public order, morality, health and to the other provisions of this Part”, which set conditions precedent for the legal protection of religious practices of any community. The closing words of this prefatory rider in Article 25 virtually constitute a subordination clause placing other fundamental rights mentioned in Part III over and above the right to religious freedom. Among those other fundamental rights is the right to equality before law and equal protection of laws — assured at the outset and elaborated in later articles to mean, inter alia, that the state shall not deny equal protection of laws to any person or group of persons on the basis of religion alone.
“Give what is Caesar’s to Caesar and what is God’s to God” is said to be part of Jesus Christ’s teachings. Realising that in the Indian tradition too much is believed to be God’s than Caesar’s, Constitution-makers found it necessary to clarify the limits of people’s religious freedom. The clarification came in the form of a declaration in Article 25 that “nothing in this article” shall prevent the state from regulating or restricting by law any “economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religion”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
What is, then, the yardstick to decide if any particular tradition is a genuine religious practice or a “secular activity associated with religion”? The Supreme Court has generated a litmus test for this purpose — is it an “essential practice integral to” the concerned religion? And, to find out the true position about it, the court has been looking into authentic texts and their interpretations acceptable unanimously to all of its followers or at least to their overwhelming majority.
As regards the Muslims, under Islamic jurisprudence religious precepts are placed in two separate compartments — ibadaat (spiritual matters) and muamlaat (temporal matters) — and in either of these, there is a further categorisation. Practices specifically enjoined by the Quran (divine book) or Hadith (Prophet’s sayings) are farz or wajib — obligatory absolutely in the first and generally in the latter case. All other actions mentioned in religious books are either mustahab (recommended) or jaez (permissible). Going by these classifications, religious practices that are farz or wajib for the Muslims will be covered in India by the religious freedom clause of the Constitution. Even what is recommended by religious texts can perhaps be claimed to fall under that protective umbrella, but not what is merely permissible — and certainly not any abominable practice that according to Muslim theologians themselves is bidat (against true religion).
The provision for religious freedom under Article 25 closes with a final clarification that “nothing in this article” shall prevent the state from making laws providing for social welfare and reform. In its deeper meaning this assertive clause — applicable to all communities — engenders a fiduciary obligation for the custodians of state authority to move in this direction as and when necessary."

Even as the Supreme Court Thursday observed that it would examine if triple talaq was an essential religious practice of Islam, the Centre called for an authoritative ruling on whether personal laws — as a facet of freedom to practise religion — would be circumscribed by fundamental rights of equality and to live with dignity. Questioning the validity of triple talaq, the Centre has sought a fresh debate on issues relating to limitations of freedom to profess, practise and propagate religion in the light of fundamental rights that guarantee every person equality and right to life and liberty.
Amid a non-uniform body of Supreme Court decisions on the subject, the government appealed for a decisive ruling on four questions. The questions submitted by the government are:https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
— Whether the impugned practices of talaq-e-biddat, nikaah halala and polygamy are protected under Article 25(1) of the Constitution of India? Article 25(1) deals with freedom to practise religion.
— Whether Article 25(1) is subject to part III of the Constitution and in particular Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India? Articles 14 ensures right to equality while Article 21 guarantees right to life and liberty.
— Whether personal law is law under Article 13 of the Constitution? Article 13 lays down that all laws should conform to the fundamental rights.
— Whether the impugned practices of talaq-e-biddat, nikaah halala and polygamy are compatible with India’s obligations under International treaties and covenants to which India is a signatory? During the hearing Thursday, a bench led by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar indicated that it was inclined to form a five-judge Constitution Bench for adjudicating upon issues raised in a clutch of petitions challenging validity of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy.
“We have to go by the law. We have to consider whether it is a fundamental trait of the religion, if it is so then we have to view it from another perspective…all the issues raised in the petitions are important and cannot be scuttled,” said the bench. It asked the counsel, representing different parties, to prepare brief submissions and submit to the court by March 30. The bench, also comprising Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud, sought assistance of the Attorney General in framing the issues on the next date of hearing. It hinted that a Constitution Bench may be formed to take up the matter during the summer vacation. Laws that violate fundamental rights can be struck down by a constitutional court but the Supreme Court has exhibited an inconsistent attitude in testing constitutionality of personal laws.
In a number of cases, it has held that personal laws are not subject to Part III of the Constitution that deals with fundamental rights and hence, they cannot be challenged for violating rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 21. In Krishna Singh Vs Mathura Ahir, 1980, the top court held that “Part III of the Constitution does not touch upon the personal laws of the parties.” On the other hand, in a line of other judgments, the apex court has tested personal laws on the touchstone of fundamental rights and read down these laws or interpreted them so as to make them consistent with fundamental rights. In Anil Kumar Mhasi Vs Union of India, 1994, the court tested the validity of some sections of the Indian Divorce Act (a personal law for Christians) on the touchstone of fundamental rights."
"1617716973-19","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","Does BJP really want the code?","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/does-bjp-really-want-the-code/","Does BJP really want the code?","August 19, 2003","Both in the Shah Bano case and in the Sarla Mudgal case, the Supreme Court found successive governments ‘‘wholly remiss’’ in acting in accordance with Article 44 of the Constitution in bringing into force a uniform civil code and requested the prime minister to take a fresh look at the matter. Almost 20 years later, Chief Justice Khare has repeated this plea.
In the above cases, the Supreme Court made the mistake of equating the uniform civil code with Hindu reforms when the court remarked that ‘‘the utmost has been done to codify Hindu law’’, thus falling prey to the fiction that the Hindu Code is a perfect one.
In the 20’s and 30’s, women in the forefront of the national movement such as Kamladevi Chattopadhyaya and Sarojini Naidu repeatedly raised the demand for a comprehensive code. But broader political considerations prevailed. Post Independence attempts also met with resistance from conservative Hindu sections including the then president, Rajendra Prasad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This is why, despite the codification of Hindu law, coparcenary concepts continued. Daughters had equal rights only in the self earned and not the ancestral property of the father and even this could be denied either by will or by converting the former into joint property. The father continues to be the natural guardian of a legitimate child and the mother of an illegitimate child, absolving the father of the moral responsibility of looking after the illegitimate child. In adoption, the emphasis is not on the child or the family but on male succession and a male child cannot be adopted if a biological male child exists. The woman cannot adopt and is relegated to the passive role of acquiescence. Bigamy is widespread only because there is no registration of marriages.
A genuine uniform civil code will, therefore, impact on Hindu law as it is practiced today and eliminate discrimination against Hindu women. Does the BJP really want such a code?
Instead of moving towards a uniform civil code, the country moved in the opposite direction. The Special Marriage Act 1954 required marriages to be registered. Opposition by conservative Hindu sections resulted in the amendment in 1955 by which a man could also claim maintenance from his wife. Finally by the 1976 amendment, Hindus were taken out of this secular code. The second major reversal took plae after the Shah Bano judgement. And in Arunachal Pradesh, a Bill was introduce seeking to codify tribal customs including polygamy and child marriages.
Women’s organisations and secular groups submitted to government the Adoption of Children Bill which was submitted in Rajya Sabha in 1972 and 1980 and then forgotten. They also presented to the government the Indian Marriages and Matrimonial Remedies Bill 1986, the Indian Inheritance Bill, 1994 and the Indian Descent and Distribution Bill 1994. The Catholic Bishops Conference of India submitted a Christian Marriage Bill 1993. All these initiatives were important steps towards introducing, albeit piecemeal, a uniform civil code. They lie with the government, gathering dust.
The Goa Code is uniform in some respects, optional in others. Sons and daughters have equal rights to parents’ property. Only half the property can be willed away. Matrimonial property is joint but is managed by the husband. Polygamy and triple talaq are not permissible, although bigamy is, if there is no male child by the first wife. Women’s organisations report that the positive provisions are circumvented in numerous ways.
Conservative sections of all communities claim that a uniform civil code will undermine religion. Nothing could be further from the truth. A uniform civil code will, in the first instance, do away with only those parts of personal law which infringe on the Constitution, particularly the Fundamental Rights and the Equality clause. It will not touch personal laws that are not offensive to women. Triple talaq and polygamy will go. In Iran, Jordan, Syria, Morocco and Pakistan such reforms have already taken place.
A uniform civil code can go even further. It can do away with fault based divorce and replace it with irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It can create the concept of joint ownership of matrimonial property. And do away with discrimination based on sexual preferences. Prominent women’s organisations, including representatives of the Muslim community, held a meeting in Bombay on Gender Just laws in 1996 and called for a genuine uniform civil code. At about the same time a conference on the human rights of women held in Lahore, made a similar demand. The time to act is now."

The Centre on Saturday said its stand on triple talaq is perfectly in sync with the spirit of the Constitution which is based on the principles of gender equality and justice. On October 7, the Centre had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq among Muslims, maintaining that it cannot be regarded as an essential part of religion.
“Our stand on triple talaq which we had to be spelt out in response to a query by the apex court is precisely in accordance with the principles of gender justice, equality and dignity enshrined in the Constitution of India,” Union Minister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters.
Welcoming the ongoing debate on triple talaq in the country, he said there must be a discussion on the status of a large section of women in a secular country like India as to whether or not they should be kept in a vulnerable condition.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Prasad said the provision of triple talaq should also be viewed in the light of the fact that it doesn’t exist or is regulated by law in at least a dozen Muslim countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Morocco, Egypt, Iran and Sudan besides several others.
Replying to a question whether it did not reflect the BJP’s desire to impose a uniform civil code in the country, he said the two were separate issues.
“The law commission is discussing the issue of a uniform civil code and our stand on the issue of triple talaq has got nothing to do with that,” he said.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, also referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court."

(Source: PTI, Mamata Banerjee/ Facebook)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement did not go down well with opposition parties, and everyone slammed BJP for the hasty decision. Coming down heavily on the PM, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had previously termed the decision as heartless and draconian. Now, everyone’s aware of the difficulty that the common man has had to face over the past two days, and as angst usually inspires creativity, it seems the ‘people’s leader’ was also moved to vent her frustration as a poem.
Banerjee posted the lengthy 32-line poem on her social media account, lambasting “the ruler” using strong words like “authoritarian”, talking about his rule as a “tyrannical” raj. Written in Bengali, the CM has played with many and hit out at Modi without taking his name.
Mincing no words, she starts with a direct blow at the PM, taunting him about forgotten the duty of a king, the duty as a citizen, the intolerance day and night that plagues the country, the ‘one king’ who considers himself ‘god’, hitting his target with the most poisonous arrow.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She goes on to elaborate who this target is – is it really those who are hoarding black money, on the poor man who now can’t even manage to get a single day’s wages.
Poetically, she uses metaphors such as “Lokkhir jhanpi”, meaning the precious purse of goddess Lakshmi, the lord of wealth, and by his move that purse is now empty. She accuses the ruler of safeguarding the guilty and punishing the poor man.

Voicing exactly what many have been asking these past few days, she questions the “haste” and how in just “one day” the ruler “turned everyone to a destitute”. She writes: “So fast, in so much haste, Why this unplanned dream? Snatching everything from the common man, You have shattered the hearts of poor.”
She mocks at the decision of offering Rs 2000 in exchange by saying that the ruler has first taken away the right of the people and then have been giving them “alms” from that money?
Someone even attempted to translate the poem in English for better understanding of others.

The chief minister highlights the misery of the daily wagers and the outcry in the markets she asks, “Have you heard that labourers have not received their wages?” With reference of “swetpadma” (white lotus), she also takes a dig at BJP’s symbol. In the end, she warns, “those you have robbed, showing off the white lotus of chastity, be prepared in coming days, to get triple talaq’.
The poem has been shared by many, but not many supported her sentiment. In fact, people have been applauding the PM for taking “bold” decision instead.

Yesterday, while dispelling the notion that family planning was not encouraged by Islam, Sadiq had pointed out that Muslim countries like Iran had achieved almost zero per cent population growth. ‘‘I have written to Shia and Sunni religious leaders that we must sit together and discuss a model of family planning based on the example of these countries,’’ he had said.

But contradicting Sadiq’s stand, Nadwi today said: ‘‘If any member of the community has some physical problems, he can approach the mufti. But there is no place for family planning in Islam.’’
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As for his vice-chairman’s statement, the AIMPLB chairman claimed ‘‘it was said in his (Sadiq’s) personal capacity and did not reflect the opinion of the Board.’’

He also denied that the issue was slated to be discussed at the next Board meeting. ‘‘It is not on the agenda as the Board is not empowered to change the basic teachings of Islam,’’ he said. The Board’s annual meeting is scheduled to be held in Kozhikode in December.

Pointing out how the ulemas had opposed the Indira Gandhi Government’s move to enforce family planning on Muslims during the Emergency, Nadiq said:  ‘‘The Congress was dethroned from the Centre for the first time, and the anger of the Muslims contributed to the party’s downfall.’’

While stating that there had been no change in the ulemas’ position, the AIMPLB chairman added that Sadiq was not the Board’s mulazim (employee) and was entitled to his ‘‘personal opinion’’.

‘‘Family planning among Muslims should not be made a issue. Instead, attention should be paid to the evils which threaten to divide society,’’ he said, claiming that the growth rate of Muslims was lower than that of other communities.

The conflicting views of the two heads are bound to create ripples, both in the Board as well as the rest of the community, especially at a time when the AIMPLB is yet to get over the controversy surrounding the triple talaq issue."

The government hopes that the biggest impact of its demonetisation move would be on the mindset of people, according to Union Minister Piyush Goyal. Speaking at the Express Adda in Pune Sunday, the Minister of State (independent charge) for power, coal, new and renewable energy, and mines, said that demonitisation has given the nation a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to leave behind a legacy for its youth. “The ‘chalta hai’ approach has to change some day. Old habits die hard and I cannot expect that tomorrow the whole world will become clean and everybody will run their business honestly. But it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a nation as large as India to think differently, to try and leave behind a legacy for the youth of India, which is different from the one we inherited. And to my mind, the time is right,” he said.

Making a strong case for going digital, Goyal said that such a move could help the country save more than Rs 20,000 crore. “Currently in India, we have about 71 crore debit cards and 26 million credit cards. Over 450 million of them are used only for withdrawing cash from an ATM. Hardly 45-50 million are used for transacting. It’s an unfortunate situation. Transacting through cash — drawing cash, printing of currency, movement of notes and then collecting them back in the bank, dispensing it through ATMs or counters — costs us Rs 55 to Rs 70 per transaction, all of which can be saved,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Coming down heavily on the Opposition for holding protests against demonetisation, Goyal said the people have overwhelmingly supported the government’s move. The minister also said that the soon-to-be-introduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) would not be successful if a parallel economy existed. “GST would be more successful after demonetisation,” he said.
Speaking about charges levelled by the Opposition, that the government was causing distress to the country for only 0.2 per cent of fake currency in circulation, Goyal said that the government can only give details of fake currency detected or discovered through investigation.
“Now that’s the fake currency that got caught. I don’t know how much more there is because if I knew, I would have caught it. Similarly, how much black money is there is something that the former prime minister and his party will know better. I certainly don’t know. But when this scheme ends, we will certainly know how much increased taxes we get out of the scheme, or how much money never gets deposited in the account because we expect to have all the honest money back into the banking system,” he said.
Welcoming the decision of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to abstain from the protests over demonetisation, Goyal said he was glad that the JD(U) leader was not part of the “unethical protests”.
Asked about the possibility of any future alliance between the JD(U) and BJP, Goyal quipped: “We are against triple talaq but the Constitution allows for honorable divorce in case of a rocky marriage.”"

How do you look the family fight within the Samajwadi Party will impact the UP polls?


Their family fight is a fight for power (varchasva ki ladaai). Their base voters are Yadavs, now they too will be divided into two. A message will also go out to OBCs that they are divided. And Muslims have decided to vote for a party that is in a position to defeat the BJP. The BSP is the natural beneficiary.
What if the SP manages to stitch together a grand alliance?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
You have to see whether the parties with which they are trying to ally have any base in UP. These parties have no presence in UP. The condition of the Congress is already bad. Moreover, this also shows the SP has accepted it has become weak. After all, why did they need an alliance? It’s because they have gone weak.
Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is banking on youth appeal as well as development.
Which youth are with him? Those who were with Mulayam Singh Yadav are now with him… They have started no new work, only renamed old schemes we had launched. Most of the expressway projects were initiated during our time. Mahamaya Pension Yojana was renamed Samajwadi Pension Yojana.
The BJP is trying to consolidate among Dalits, especially non-Jatavs. Could this divide the Dalit vote?
A bill was brought for an amendment to the SC/ST reservation system (quota in promotion bill)… We got it passed in Rajya Sabha but the BJP did not allow it through Lok Sabha. This has led to all such castes consolidating in favour of the BSP.
Rahul Gandhi has been visiting Dalit homes in UP. 
So what. That is what Amit Shah [BJP chief] too is doing. Dalits are not going to be fooled this way. They are with the BSP.
Do you foresee Rohith Vemula’s suicide and the flogging of Dalits in Una impacting the polls?
This will hugely damage the BJP in UP as well as in the 2019 general elections.

Since you mention 2019, do you see any common Opposition candidate emerging after the UP polls to take on Narendra Modi?
Let the results [UP] first come.
Do you think it’s time for a Dalit PM?
Let the time come.
Do you think the BJP could have done better if it had named a CM candidate?
Let alone a CM candidate, they don’t even have candidates for 403 seats… They are scared that if they declare a particular CM candidate, other castes will desert them.
But the strike across the Line of Control will have created the impression of a strong government, won’t it?
Had there been peace on the border after the strike, the BJP could have gained something. But firing continues… They want to gain out of the action of the Army. It is the Army that should get the credit.
Do you expect polarisation between Hindus and Muslims?

Both the BJP and the SP are trying to create communal tension but people have become aware. When the BSP was in power, there were no communal riots. The Muzaffarnagar riots happened [in 2013] and both the BJP and the SP were responsible.
The Ram temple issue is being revived. 
They have been in government for 2½ years, what were they doing so far? Now when elections are near, they remember it… Will the Supreme Court allow them to construct a Ram temple now?
Wouldn’t Brahmin voters rather go with the BJP?
It is the BSP that will get Brahmin votes. In fact we will get votes of all communities. The BSP believes in the philosophy sarvajan hitaya, sarvajan sukhaye.
But many leaders deserted the BSP. Won’t that help the BJP gain among their communities?
It will have no impact. Some leaders have left but their communities are still with the BSP.

Ahmadiyya Muslims from over 50 countries are expected to participate in the 125th annual congregation of the community to be held in the last week of this month at Qadian in Punjab. Thousands of Ahmadiyyas including those from Pakistan are expected to arrive at Qadian for the spiritual ‘Salana Jalsa’. Last year, around 5,000 people from Pakistan had attended the event but this year their confirmation is yet to received, said Tariq Ahmad Ahmadiyya, spokesperson of Ahmadiyya Muslim Ja’amat India.

“Generally their confirmation is received late because most of them travel by road and border clearance issues are to be managed. But those coming by flights will definitely participate although there is tension between the two countries,” he said.
A large delegation from Indonesia will also participate in the event scheduled on December 26-28.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In 1891, the founder of Ahmadiyya Muslim community, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, had initiated the spiritual event to promote inter-religious peace and harmony, said Shiraz Ahmad, additional chief secretary of the Jama’at.
The event will be marked by a ‘world religions’ session in which people from different faiths will suggest solutions to the problems faced by world, Shiraz said.
On the last day, a televised address will be given by worldwide head of Ahmadiyya community, Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, who is based in London.
The message of love and loyalty towards one’s nation will also be emphasised during the discussions at the event, Shiraz said.
The Ahmadiyya leaders also expressed their opposition to instantaneous triple talaq and extended support to Uniform Civil Code for the country.
“Those who make Muslim laws should sit together to remove flaws in triple talaq in one go. We believe there should be equal interval in each pronouncement of talaq to give time to spouses to sort out their disagreements.
“As far as Uniform Civil Code is concerned, we go by the government. We feel Ahmadiyyas will not face any problems if it is implemented,” Tariq said in reply to questions by reporters.
There are around 1.5 lakh Ahmadiyya community members in the country."

(Express photo/File)
Targeting the All India Muslim Personal Law Board over the issue of ‘triple talaq’, Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar Saturday accused the organisation of turning itself into a “male personal law board which is only interested in oppressing women”.
“Islam calls for gender equality and not gender oppression. Islam has never called for oppressing women. The Muslim Personal Law Board has turned into male personal law board,” Akbar said while addressing a programme in Kolkata. On the last month’s convention of AIMPLB supporting ‘triple talaq’ which was attended by a large number of people, Akbar said, “Huge gathering always doesn’t signify truth.”

Calling for removal of ‘triple talaq’ as it is against humanity, Akbar said, “Sometimes a marriage doesn’t work so there is a clause of divorce. But while marrying in Muslim community you need the permission of the women. Then why during divorce (talaq), only a man will dictate terms and by spelling the word ‘talaq’ three times (it can be obtained).” Akbar noted that if the country has to move forward and if the economy has to grow, we need to take the women along.
“India and its economy can never grow if you want to keep the women behind. Women consist of nearly 50 per cent of our population and we all have to move together towards it,” he said. A debate has emerged over the government’s stand opposing the practice of ‘triple talaq’ with some leading women politicians seeking its abolition, even as some Muslim bodies accused the ruling dispensation of waging a “war” on their personal law."
"1617717023-33","https://indianexpress.com/page/122/?s=Triple+talaq","The veil of ignorance","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/the-veil-of-ignorance/","The veil of ignorance","August 24, 2004","It will be no consolation for Saddiqunissa, from a village near Sitapur, UP, to learn that a very ill Kiran, 27 years old and a mother of three sons, was carried in her father’s arms to the Kakardooma court in New Delhi in a desperate attempt to pursue her application to seeking maintenance from her indifferent husband. So far there have only been adjournments. Like Kiran, millions of poor women are suffering the indignities of their husband’s neglect in a country where cultural pressures lead to parents marrying their daughters off either as part of dharma or sunna (farz).
In Saddiqunissa’s case, Justice I M Quddusi of the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of Allahabad has rightly returned the maintenance application to the lower court to examine its merits, as well as to enquire and adjudicate accordingly whether or not the husband has followed correct talaq procedures. It appears that when Saddiqunissa filed an application for maintenance from her estranged husband, he divorced her and the lower court dismissed her application. She then went to the high court. If so, the dismissal of the maintenance application without relief being provided is illegal.
After the judgment in Danial Lattifi & another (myself) Vs Union of India, challenging the constitutional validity of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act of 1986, the Supreme Court has given a Muslim woman the right to receive maintenance for life from her husband even on divorce or until she re-marries. Therefore the question of maintenance not being granted in this particular case cannot even arise. In order to prevent the destitution and vagrancy that results from triple talaq, the implementation of the law pronounced is not optional but mandatory. However, the Muslim leadership, fully aware of the implications of this judgment, has taken no steps to create general awareness of it in backward areas.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In the practice of Muslim law in India, the unilateral right of the Muslim husband to dissolve the contract of marriage is recognised. But in order to do away with inequalities, various judgments are bringing in an element of equity. As per the ruling of the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court, a talaq must be confirmed by the court in order to be valid, thereby taking away the instantaneous character from the tradition of triple talaq. This is applicable all over the country unless the high court of another state either disagrees with the decision or the Supreme Court sets the judgment aside.
In the matter of Saddiqunissa, the high court rightly pointed out the necessary procedure for dissolving marriage. It also pointed out that talaq could not be given by the husband in one instance and only comes into force after a certain time (three months and a gap of one month in each pronouncement) which is meant for reconciliation and arbitration by friends and relatives. Finally, talaq has to be confirmed by a court, which has to hold that the marriage was dissolved on valid grounds. Only then would talaq become final.
The case of Nagma Bibi of Orissa is important here. She was divorced by her husband in a drunken state. Next morning he realised he had committed a  terrible mistake and wanted his wife back. She also wanted to go back but community leaders are preventing them from doing so. They have forcibly sent her with her three children to her father’s house. It is being suggested that Nagma Bibi will have to marry someone else and only upon being divorced by that person can she re-marry her husband. This practice is called Halala.
Triple talaq and Halala are not prescribed in Quran, the main source of Shariat and Muslim law. These are social evils and not Islamic practices and only continue to be propagated because of the ignorance of community leaders as well as the community as a whole.
The maintenance legislation passed in 2001 by Parliament does not include its benefits for Muslim women. The legislation needs to be amended to include Muslim women, irrespective of political implications. This is legally possible after the above-mentioned Supreme Court judgment passed in September 2001, challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act of 1986. Destitution, vagrancy, trafficking of neglected women does not vary with region, religion, caste or creed. The response to the basic right to life based on religion, with which the issue of maintenance of woman is linked, is unconstitutional and unethical. By suitably amending the maintenance legislation, we will preserve our diversity and pluralism. Equality before law and equal protection of law guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution would become a reality in the area of rights of maintenance of Indian women, who are dependent on their families for survival in the absence of any state social security.

The Delhi High Court today dismissed a plea seeking a direction to the Centre that triple ‘talaq’ or polygamy should not be applicable to Hindu women who are married to Muslim men. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra said it was not inclined to go into the issue as the Supreme Court is already seized of the triple talaq matter related to changes in the muslim personal law. It said there is no dispute that a Constitution bench has been formed to hear the issue. So, the law laid down by it will be applicable to all women and children of the society.
The high court further noted that “all women are entitled to equal protection under the law.” “In view of it (Supreme Court seized of the issue) we are not inclined to hear the issue. The petition is dismissed,” the bench said. The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by advocate Vijay Kumar Shukla had highlighted the plight of Hindu women affected by triple talaq. It had also sought directions to the Centre for making registration of inter-caste marriages compulsory under the Special Marriage Act or Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act with a clause on imposition of penalty in case an inter-caste marriage is not registered.
A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court will be hearing from May 11 a batch of petitions challenging the practice of triple talaq and polygamy as unconstitutional and discriminatory towards women. Muslim practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy are issues that are “very important” and involve “sentiments”, the apex court had observed."

Terming sages in India as a “frustrated” lot, Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan courted a fresh controversy as he advised BJP MP Yogi Adityanath to get married and “prove his masculinity” with the latter seeking his expulsion.
“Yogi Adityanath should first get married and prove his masculinity,” Khan told reporters on the sidelines of an event here last night.
Replying to question on whether he considered all sages in the country did not possess masculinity, Khan said, “they are frustrated.”

“How would a Mahant know what love is … he should first get married and help in growth of generation,” he said.
Following the Samajwadi Party leader’s remarks, a fuming Adityanath advised Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to sack him so that people can set him right.
He said Khan has lost his mental balance and needed medical attention.
Meanwhile in Lucknow, state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said such a statement only indicated Khan’s mental bankruptcy.
“The SP should apologise for the same,” he said, adding the minister has degraded the dignity of sages.
The remarks also invited wrath of various Hindu outfits who held a dharna against Khan and burnt his effigy in protest.
Khan also attacked another BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj and said there are many serious cases against him which are condemnable.
The BJP legislator from Unnao had recently described the provision of triple talaq (divorce) in Muslim community as an injustice to women.

Illustrations: C R Sasikumar
It will be an understatement to say that the result of the Uttar Pradesh election, where the BJP got an unprecedented three-fourth majority, bagging 325 seats, is historic. It represents, in many ways, a tectonic shift in the polity of India. Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India, is a mini-India with all the currents, cross-currents and strands of competitive politics, in abundance. The Congress held sway over the state for many decades; the BJP too, for a few years, but for nearly two decades, the two regional parties, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), were dominant players. In fact, the extraordinary victory of the BJP in 1991, during the Ram lehar, had become a distant memory.
Then came the new defining moment of 2014, when the BJP and its allies won 73 seats out of 80. However, getting three-fourths of the seats now, 325 in 403 and retaining the same vote share, approximately 42 per cent in 2014, and nearly 40 per cent in 2017, after almost three years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration at the Centre, is phenomenal.
What does this indicate? First and foremost, this shows the profound connect which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has with the people of India, who are willing to trust even the hardest decisions taken by him as beneficial for the country and the common citizen. It is not simply his own charisma — this connect flows from an abiding belief that what PM Modi says is delivered. There is no corruption in decision-making at the central government. Pro-poor initiatives, like the Jan Dhan Yojana, Crop Insurance Scheme, various affordable insurance schemes, Ujjwala Yojana, cooking gas for the poor, electricity to unconnected villages, Swachh Bharat toilets in villages, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, all started showing their results on the ground.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As a minister of information technology, I can say that we have established nearly 2,00,000 Common Service Centres, delivering various digital services across the country, run by small entrepreneurs in Gram Panchayats and semi-urban areas, including minority and Dalit women. In Uttar Pradesh, there are more than 50,000 Common Services Centres. I organised large conferences around these in Varanasi and Meerut and I saw the sparkle in people’s eyes about Digital India and the promise of an exciting future that it holds for them. The phenomenal success of digital literacy, including for aanganwadi workers, was also helping this process. People on the ground were distinguishing with ease between the delivery of government of India programmes and the unfulfilled promises of the Akhilesh Yadav government — which were delivered in a highly partisan and discriminatory manner.
Coupled with this promising delivery was Narendra Modi’s leadership signifying courage and a strong conviction for a corruption-free India. Not only surgical strikes, even his bold gamble to invite a referendum on demonetisation was appreciated by the poor who perceive him as a leader keen to purge India of the ills of corruption and black money. The phenomenal success of these programmes is being recognised and appreciated the world over, but unfortunately, the opposition, primarily because of its antipathy to Modi, mocked at it. The people rejected such negative politics.
I myself campaigned extensively in Uttar Pradesh and one could clearly find a palpable connect between the poor and the prime minister. He is our man, our welfare is central to his priority, felt the common citizen. Therefore, there was a keen desire to bring a government which could work in coordination with the prime minister’s vision. In my considered view, this is therefore a victory of hope: It is an assertion of aspiration for good governance and growth with equity — without corruption.
Along with the extraordinary charisma of the prime minster, we also need to acknowledge the stellar role of the party president Amit Shah, who weaved together a fine rainbow coalition of various castes and communities, including OBCs and MBCs. I would say, not only the forward, backward and most backward castes, large numbers of young people, of all castes and communities — even Muslim women in good number, some of them victims of triple talaq — found solace in the BJP, which had the courage to challenge this menace head-on.
While we need to acknowledge the extraordinary hard work of the booth-level worker and the cadre, such an outstanding result, which never happened in terms of sheer scale before, must also highlight that this can happen only when the desire to bring the BJP to power becomes part of a peoples’ movement.
The BJP has won a three-fourth majority in Uttarakhand too, and even as it has lost Punjab, it is within striking distance of forming a government in Manipur. In all probability, it will retain Goa: The vote-share of the BJP in Goa is 32.5 per cent, while that of the Congress is 28.3 per cent. The extraordinary performance in Manipur, where the BJP did not even have a single ward counsellor, is truly phenomenal. The proud people of Manipur always wanted Manipur to come into the national mainstream.
Overall, today the BJP is truly an all-India party having a pan-India presence, from north to south, east to west. With the latest Vidhan Sabha results, 11 states, including some of the biggest states of India, will have a BJP chief minister. It is also a part of coalition governments in Jammu and Kashmir, Nagaland and Andhra Pradesh. With every possibility of having its own government in Manipur and Goa, the number of states governed by the BJP will only rise. The BJP’s vote share in West Bengal and Kerala has increased, while it is resurgent in Odisha.
All this is without any dynasty or family control — only by sheer hard work, good governance, profound organisational presence and leadership by a selfless person, a man of destiny, Narendra Modi, who has a vision to make India truly a great country. Desh jaagta hai, jagaane wala hona chahiye: The nation rises. But there must be one to awaken it to its destiny."

A law on the practice of ‘triple talaq’ among Muslims would be formulated only after there is a consensus among the stakeholders, Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in Mumbai on Friday.
“Triple talaq is a serious issue. Non-serious players should not destroy the positive, constructive debate over it. Reforms should start from within the community, not from outside,” Naqvi, who was in the city to attend a programme at the Haj House, told PTI.
He said suggestions on ‘triple talaq’ were pouring in from different sections of the society and discussions were underway with all the stakeholders.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Some people are supporting while some are opposing. It is all part of a healthy democracy. As far as the government is concerned, we will wait for a consensus before forming any law on triple talaq. It (the law) will not be sudden. The process is on,” Naqvi said.
“Whatever the government does, will be done within the framework of the Constitution, but a consensus on triple talaq remains a priority for us,” he added.
The Centre had, earlier this week, told the Supreme Court that the practices of ‘triple talaq’, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy had an adverse impact on the social status and dignity of Muslim women and denied them the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
In a fresh written submission filed before the apex court, the government has reiterated its earlier stand that these practices render Muslim women “unequal and vulnerable” as compared to the men in the community as well as women from other communities."
"1617717146-66","https://indianexpress.com/page/120/?s=Triple+talaq","Talaq given in extreme anger not valid, says HC","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/talaq-given-in-extreme-anger-not-valid-says-hc/","Talaq given in extreme anger not valid, says HC","October 29, 2007 12:06:42 am","In a relief to Muslim women across the country, the Delhi High Court has declared that talaq (Islamic mode of divorce) given by their husbands in “extreme anger” is invalid.
“If a talaq is pronounced in extreme anger where the husband has lost control of himself, it would not be effective or valid,” Justice Badar Durrez Ahamed ruled.
Pointing out that triple talaq or talaq-e-bidaat (divorce in one go by merely repeating the term ‘talaq’ thrice) as “sinful but valid”, the court said such a mode for dissolution of Islamic marriages had caused “extreme misery to divorced women and even to men, who are left with no chance to undo the wrong or any scope to bring about a reconciliation”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While issuing an injunction on courts that the Muslim Personal Law would supercede any “contrary customs or usage” followed in dissolution of marriages, Justice Ahamed held that from henceforth triple talaq would only mean a single pronouncement of “talaq”, revocable by the husband or wife if they decide to reconcile.
Presently, an effective divorce can be procured instantly in one sitting if either three pronouncements of the word ‘talaq’ are clubbed in a single sentence or in three sentences of “I divorce you”.
The Bench justified its decision to hold the pronouncement of triple talaq as “revocable” on the ground that a premium be given for reconciliation between the spouses.
This is the first time that a court has made “attempts for reconciliation” mandatory after pronouncement of talaq. Till now, efforts for reconciliation, if any, were to precede the divorce pronouncement.
Differing with the present law that expiry of the iddat period (three menstrual courses or three lunar months after the divorce) would act as the deadline for estranged spouses to save their marriages, the court held that couples could still settle their differences by contracting a fresh marriage even after the period was over.
The court further stressed that mere pronouncement of talaq did not ipso facto (on the face of the fact) amount to dissolution of marital tie between the spouses.
“The wife upon whom talaq has been pronounced has the right of residence as well as of maintenance and she cannot be disturbed, she continues to be the wife of the man in the iddat period during which the marital tie remains in suspense,” the Bench formalised the status of the divorced woman.
The court was hearing a bail application of a young man who, in the absence of his wife, declared talaq in anger after a marital dispute, but later resumed conjugal relations with her, “forgetting” the fact that he had divorced her.
Their marriage soured again and the wife, Aisha Anjum, left the matrimonial home along with their minor daughter. It was only then she knew that her husband had declared talaq. Following which she lodged a complaint of rape against Masroor with the Preet Vihar Police Station.
In her FIR, she alleged that Masroor had played a fraud by subjecting her to sexual intercourse in the guise of being her “lawful husband”.
The court quashed the FIR, saying Masroor’s pronouncement of talaq was after all in “extreme anger” and the offence of rape was not made out.
Reacting to the order, spokesperson and Assistant General Secretary of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Abdur Rahim Qureshi expressed his reservation to The Indian Express: “Triple talaq is considered valid by all four Sunni schools in India. I differ with the High Court’s order. Triple talaq pronounced in one sitting is valid and immediately enforceable. It is not revocable as held by the court.”
However, he agreed with Justice Ahamed’s ruling that talaq declared in a “frenzy” would remain invalid.
There is “growing dissent” in the Muslim community and even within the AIMPLB about the “correct interpretation” of triple talaq. Syed Shahabuddin, senior member of the Board and editor of Muslim India, says the “battle is between those who go by the practice of talaq in one sitting and others who believe that such a mode of talaq is not according to the Quran”.
“The High Court order reflects the correct interpretation of triple talaq — an issue which is the subject of debate in the AIMPLB. Every pronouncement of talaq should be interspersed with proper intervals for affording couples an opportunity to reconcile. I support the order of the Delhi High Court in principle wholeheartedly,” Shahabuddin said."

(File)
A passionate debate has emerged over the government’s stand to oppose the practice of “triple talaq” with some leading women politicians seeking its abolition, even as Muslim bodies accused the ruling dispensation of waging a “war” on their personal law. Though most of the women leaders avoided direct comments on the Centre’s affidavit or sought to dissect it, they were strongly critical of the prevalent practice of dissolving marriage through ‘triple talaq’. Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, who was the Minority Affairs Minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet before being appointed to the gubernatorial post, refrained from giving her opinion on the Centre’s stand, but, on a personal level, said an “un-Islamic” interpretation was being given to the practice of ‘triple talaq’.
Watch What Else Is Making News: 

Senior CPI(M) leader and former MP Subhashini Ali also opposed the practice of triple talaq and polygamy, seeking abolition. Their views came in the backdrop of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) taking a stand to oppose the Centre’s affidavit, which said the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims needed a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The AIMPLB and other Muslim bodies said they would boycott the Law Commission’s proceedings in the matter and accused the Modi government of waging a “war” against their personal laws. They also said a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will “kill” India’s pluralism. The controversy arose after the Law Commission recently sought feedback from the public on whether the practice of triple talaq should be abolished and whether a uniform civil code be made optional.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Making no direct comment on the Centre’s affidavit, Heptulla said those who say ‘talaq, talaq, talaq’ in one go were not interpreting Islam correctly and “have no right to bring a bad name to religion as they are giving it an un-Islamic interpretation”. While Ali found fault with the “unilateral system of divorce by men” and advocated that the Muslim clerics must “change their approach”, social activist Shabnam Hashmi categorically said “this practice (triple talaq) should be abolished.”
Without getting drawn into the Centre’s affidavit, Hashmi said the concept of one-time triple talaq does not exist in Islam and there is no mention of “gender inequality” in any religion or religious texts.
“Triple talaq should be abolished, it is as simple as that. No such practice is followed in any civilised society,” she asserted.
While Heptulla, Ali and Hashmi agreed to air their views on triple talaq, Aparupa Poddar, Trinamool Congress MP from Arambagh in West Bengal and is married to a Muslim, refused to be drawn into the debate leaving it for the party to take a stand on the Centre’s decision. Her party leaders also refused to take questions on the issue. Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza has said the matter of ‘triple talaq’ should be left to the Supreme Court to decide, but expressed her opposition to the “imposition” of a Uniform Civil Code.
Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said the issue should be left to religious leaders. “The issue of uniform civil code should be left to religious leaders. On the issues of country and humanity everyone should be united,” he said recently. Finding fault with the system of unilateral divorce by men, Ali, a CPI(M) Politburo member, termed it “wrong” and said women should have equal rights and the Muslim clerics must “change their approach”.
“I don’t have a problem with the Centre’s affidavit on the issue. Unilateral divorce is wrong. This right which is given only to men is wrong. Equality should be there and Muslim clerics must change their approach. I am not an expert on this issue, I am just saying that they are not in conformity with system of justice,” she added.
In reply to a series of questions on the matter, Heptulla said the practice of ‘triple talaq’ is being wrongly interpreted as the concept of one time ‘triple talaq’ does not exist in Islam. Heptulla said most of the Islamic countries have “correctly interpreted” Islam, and Quran and Prophet Mohammad say that those who do injustice to humans are not following the religion properly.
“Those who are misusing Islam and not treating women equally are wrong. I believe in what I say. Even a woman, on certain conditions of cruelty, injustice and other reasons, can seek dissolution of marriage but nobody speaks about it,” she said.
“Triple talaq cannot be given in one sitting. It has to be done in three sittings over three months and after following an arbitration process. The way they are interpreting it, is not Islamic and is not true. Mostly all Muslim countries, including our neighbour Pakistan, have accepted it,” Heptulla said, adding that Islam is not a religion of inequality.
For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre on October 7 had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism. The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism, international covenants, religious practices and marital law prevalent in various Islamic countries to drive home the point that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
Regarding abolition of the practice of polygamy in Islam as has been done in Hinduism, Heptulla said that people should think about it and any injustice to women in the name of Islam is “not correct”. On being asked if ‘triple talaq’ is being misinterpreted, Hashmi said even if its not misinterpreted, gender inequality is not found in any religion or religious text.
Referring to the recent affidavit filed by AIMPLB on the issue in the Supreme Court, Hashmi said it was “most horrendous and the apex court should take suo motu action against them” as it shows that they think from “very patriarchal mindset which is shameful”.
The AIMPLB, in its counter affidavit filed in the apex court, had said that personal laws of a community cannot be “re-written” in the name of social reforms. The board had said that the issue relating to Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and nikah halala are matters of “legislative policy” and cannot be interfered with. The Law Commission’s decision to invite views on the contentious Uniform Civil Code has drawn criticism from the AIMPLB and other Muslim organisations which said they will boycott it and accused the Modi government of waging a “war” against the community. While the government accused the AIMPLB of ‘politicking’ on the issue, Congress and Samajwadi Party have said it should not be imposed."

The aforesaid sermons by Naik, now at the centre of an international controversy after it emerged that at least two of the Dhaka attackers were inspired by him, have been around for many years, long before the Islamic State began its war. Convoluted statements on Osama bin-Laden and whether all Muslims should be terrorists have been cited previously too, at least as far back as 2010 when he was refused a visa to the UK.
The clarifications that followed were, again, precisely the same ones on offer now. Naik has claimed that the Quran forbids him from commenting on Laden whom he did not know, and that his opinion on more Muslims becoming terrorists was limited to terrorism against anti-social elements. His views on polygamy, triple talaq, rape and more are also equally well-rehearsed and oft-cited.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
If security agencies would like to trawl his speeches, there is several years’ worth of material — a few thousand lectures beamed on Peace TV since about 2004 or 2005, live speeches delivered across the world, a few thousand titles by Naik and others on subjects ranging from Haj, the Quran to Islam and the media, stacked up in the shelves lining the Dongri headquarters of the Islamic Research Foundation. There are also digital recordings, of speeches by Naik and others.

Also, the Dhaka men are not the first terrorists to confess their admiration of Naik. Other terror suspects and detainees who have told agencies across the world that they were inspired by the English-speaking Naik include Afghan-American Najibulla Zazi who was accused of plotting a bombing of the New York subway in 2009, Dr Kafeel Ahmed of Bangalore who stormed Glasgow airport in an explosives laden car a fee years prior to that, and Mumbai’s Rahil Sheikh arrested for the 7/11 serial train blasts of 2006.
Also in 2006, the Maharashtra ATS found Feroz Deshmukh, arrested in connection with the Aurangabad Arms Haul case, to have once been an IRF employee. More recently, Indian youth nabbed as alleged IS sympathisers from across India have also mentioned viewing Naik’s sermons.
In each instance, the security agencies promised to look into Naik’s speeches for anything objectionable. It would be interesting to view these agencies’ reports of their previous meticulous study of his sermons before promising further investigations."

Its real vice lies in making the woman vulnerable and open to exploitation. The system of triple talaq as understood and practised by some enables the husband to divorce his wife at his fancy after compliance with some formal requirements. One of the reforms sought in the Muslim Personal Law is to restrict the husband’s unfettered right to cast away his wife at will. Government interference in this matter will be resented and wrongly projected as attack on Islam by the fundamentalist sections in the community. The initiative for reform should originate from Muslim women themselves, which is unlikely to happen unless they are made aware of their rights by a proper system of education.
The recent example of tribal women in the Santhals is an eye opener. Tribal women have no rights over land. The age old practice of polygamy which enabled the husband to divorce his wife at will made women’s position extremely insecure. Tribal women could not put up with this injustice any longer. A two-day seminar was organised in Ranchi by the Sangharshrath Adivasi Mahila Manch. Around 800 tribal women from several states participated and demanded abolition of this pernicious practice whereby a Santhal woman can be disowned by her husband at any time without any valid reason and also without any compensation. Several speakers pointed out that women who couldn’t bear a child were often branded as witches and were tortured by close relatives in an attempt to grab their land.
The women arrived at a consensus decision at the workshop to unite and start a movement against social injustices and denial of their rights. Interestingly the workshop came down heavily on the Jharkhand government for its failure to check exploitation of tribal women in the state. This is an excellent instance of women’s consciousness and worthy of emulation by other women who are in similar situation. Ultimately it is the empowerment of women which will achieve tangible results.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
• Controversial donkeys: Cruelty to animals has been a persistent phenomenon. Donkeys have had more than their share of ill-treatment and humiliation. In common parlance a donkey is regarded as the epitome of stupidity as is evident from the irritating remarks, ‘‘who is that silly ass, the gadha, who has prepared this note or this menu for dinner, etc’’. A perceived lapse in the legal system evokes the famous Dickensian opprobrium: ‘‘The law is an ass.’’
There is strong resentment if people are equated with donkeys. A book written by late Padmashri Gopal Prasad Vyas satirically compared donkeys to politicians. ‘‘Like Indian leaders’ skin, a donkey’s skin too is thick. Any thing can be painted on it, and it would not mind. Leaders can create problems by braying any moment, but donkey has no such bad habit.’’
Politicians were up in arms and demanded action against the book. This is not all. Women’s group were also angered by another passage in the book that ‘‘a donkey is like a housewife. It has to toil all day and, like her, may even have to give up food and water. In fact, the donkey is a shade better; for while the housewife may sometimes complain and walk off to her parents’ home, you’ll never catch the donkey being disloyal to his master.’’ State education board’s director of publications, A R Khan, rightly pointed out that the comparisons were made in good humour, but to no avail. Ultimately the board succumbed and the process of removing the passages has started. Have we completely lost our sense of humour?
However donkeys are not without friends altogether. There is a fine rendition by Artie Shaw of Donkey Serenade in which Shaw takes fabulous clarinet solos. Above all remember that Christ rode on a donkey on his travel to Jerusalem. G K Chesterton exquisitely encapsulates the scene in his poem, ‘The Donkey’:
Starve, scourge, deride me:
I am dumb, I keep my secret still.
Fools! For I also had my hour;
One far fierce hour and sweet:
There was a shout about my ears,
And palms before my feet.’’"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the “most bitterly criticised” person post Independence, BJP chief  Amit Shah said on Friday, adding that if criticism was targeted against the country, it cannot be called freedom of expression.

“Sab se jyada katu alochana agar kisi ek vyakti ki hui hai azadi ke baad, to wah hai Narendra Modiji ki. (After the Independence, if there is one person who has received the most bitter criticism, it is Narendra Modi ji),” he said at the inauguration of ‘India Idea Conclave 2016’ in Goa.
 
“Alochana ka swagat hai. Alochana ko sahan bhi karna chahiye. Magar Narendra Modi ji ki alochana se ek kadam aage jakar agar isko desh ke virodh ki disha mein le jayenge to kshama karna ye sacchi swatantrata nahi hai abhivyakti ki. (Criticism is welcome and it should be tolerated. But if someone goes beyond that and targets the country, it cannot be pardoned or termed as freedom of expression),” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shah said although dissent was part of the democracy, if it continued in an unwarranted way, there could be no development.
“If people do not understand this, the purpose of democracy will collapse. The purpose of democracy is to ensure that development reaches the last man in the society – who can utilise the same to explore his maximum potential to realise his freedom,” he said.
The BJP chief alleged that the country got good governance after 68 years of Independence, when the Modi-led government came to power.
“We spoke about the all-inclusive development. In the 2014 elections, after 30 years a single party got majority in Parliament,” he said, adding that the government has implemented reforms in every sector.
Referring to the row over the issue of triple talaq, Shah said, “When the Union government has taken a stand, there was no scope for confusion on the issue.”
“The Constitution has given right to every woman to live safely here. Had you ever imagined that women’s issues could be a part of Prime Minister’s speech on Independence Day? But when BJP came to power, it became part of the PM’s speech,” he added."

In October last year, a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, while hearing another matter having little to do with Islamic law, decided to suo motu ask the Chief Justice to set up a Bench to examine gender discrimination against Muslim women, especially “arbitrary divorce”.
The case snowballed with the addition of other petitions, and after all impleadments were considered by Chief Justice T S Thakur recently, hearings have been scheduled for September.
The matter comes 30 years after the controversial Shah Bano maintenance case, which resulted in Parliament passing a law to override a Supreme Court verdict giving a divorced Muslim woman a fairer maintenance than what she got under personal laws. Muslim clerics led by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) — enraged by what they saw as interference at a time when politics in India was almost tinderbox like — were able to convince Rajiv Gandhi’s Congress that the court’s judgment eroded Islamic identity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The debate was successfully framed as an Islam-versus-women’s rights issue, and Shah Bano became a part of the Babri Masjid-and-Kashmir idea of injured Hindu pride in India. The argument being, when Hindus have had to codify and reform laws (something which the Hindu Right opposed tooth and nail when Law Minister B R Ambedkar and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru proposed it in the 1950s, leading to Ambedkar’s resignation), why then should Muslims be allowed to get away without similar codifications and laws.

Now, three decades on, is the re-emerging debate still going to go the Shah Bano way — and is it likely to end up as a victory for both the Hindu Right and the Muslim Right?

In the petition before the court now, some things do indeed appear to mirror the 1986 scenario. Such as the view of the RSS-driven Rashtriya Muslim Manch, which argues that its opposition to triple talaq and the nikah halala (an intervening marriage necessary if the old marriage has to be restored) means that there has to be a Uniform Civil Code. The AIMPLB is there too — arguing, as it did then, that there can be no debate or intervention by courts on a matter of personal law.
But there is another set of petitioners who make this case different. The Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) is intent on making it a triple talaq versus Islam debate — which would change the rules of the game for the older set of rivals.
The BMMA’s arguments begin with wanting triple talaq and nikah halala to be struck down as being unIslamic, and antithetical to Islam itself. It is not as though scholars have not argued this earlier — and to those familiar with Islam, inheritance rights, and the notion of marriage as a contract being evidence of the religion treating women as equals, are equally familiar. The fact that the Prophet’s wife was a widowed businesswoman, fifteen years older to him, and his youngest wife Ayesha led a contingent to battle, have been cited as ‘proof’ of Islam being inherently equalising. Practices from ‘jahiliya’, the so-called age of ignorance before Islam, like the purdah, chador, etc., having left their mark on regional practices and being confused with Islamic practice, have made it considerably difficult to argue that position, though.
What is likely to sneak into and impact the argument also are changes that have taken place since the 80s — both within the Islamic community and outside of it. Before Shah Bano came Nikaah, the 1982 film by B R Chopra, which popularised and framed the problem for many — in which the Pakistani actress Salma Agha played the divorced and crushed Muslim woman and the now Congress Rajya Sabha MP Raj Babbar, the second husband. Things have moved on since.
In today’s age of connectivity, with the Quran and scores of its interpretations being available on mobile phones, Muslim women have more agency, their literacy rates have risen, and their participation in the workforce, though still not at a desirable level, is much higher, say petitioners who have conducted campaigns and raised awareness levels. Debate and conversation about these matters is more prevalent. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, several mainstream Muslim clerics who might otherwise not have made a case for gender equality, found themselves citing Islamic feminism to back the presentation of their faith as a modern idea. A combination of these factors working outside India, and a proliferation of role models and their popularity, have encouraged Indian Muslim women to interrogate ‘the spirit of Islam’, and their place in it.
As far as the specifics of what is being argued in the current Shayara Bano matter goes, the disagreement is between those who see Islamic law itself as opposed to the idea of equality enshrined in the Constitution and those who argue that triple talaq and nikah halala are not Islamic, only have credence among a section of Muslims — the Hanafi tradition — and are not held as rightful by Quranic verses.
And what of the Uniform Civil Code argument? The fact that most see the Code as just an extension of the Hindu law is a problem, and there is little chance of other faiths accepting it, or agreeing to practices that may not draw at all from their respective faiths. The Special Marriages Act anyway exists for those for whom faith is not central to companionship, or for those who marry across faiths, or even caste.
The RSS-inspired petitions would likely want to use the opportunity to make a case for Islam versus good sense. And it is up to Muslim clerics — mostly men who said ‘do not interfere’ three decades ago — to back the statements they make on their faith having been egalitarian even in the seventh century. Falling back into jahiliya is not an option."

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav may expect projects like Lucknow-Agra Expressway to be a vote-catcher for his Samajwadi Party but BJP believes people will rather vote on issues like corruption and law and order and vote him out in the coming assembly polls.
Uttar Pradesh BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya also mocked the recently launched ‘Dial 100’, meant to offer prompt response to any distress call to the police helpline, saying it only highlights the worsening crime graph and that the Rs 2,000 crore spent on it could have been used for boosting police infrastructure.

“The Lucknow-Agra Expressway will not be any magic bullet for the Chief Minister. People have suffered for five years in his government due to rampant corruption and poor law and order and will vote on these issues,” he told reporters in an interview.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Modi government, he claimed, has lived up to its developmental promises and people will vote BJP to power in the state as they believe that the party means business and will deliver what it promises.
Taking on SP and BSP, two formidable regional rivals, over their attack on the Union government over demonetisation, he said both parties have been hit hard, alleging that BSP supremo Mayawati used black money to “purchase votes from the poor” while SP spent unaccounted money to capture booths.
He attributed the current peace existing between rival camps in SP to demonetisation.
“The feud was about sharing of black money it had made. After the Centre’s tough action, their fight seems to have ended. No black money, no dispute,” he said, laughing.
“Demonetisation scheme will prove to be a blessing for the country. If the Prime Minister’s mother, who is aged above 90 years, can stand in a queue outside a bank, why can’t others?… The move has people’s support,” he said.
Opposition parties have joined hands to keep BJP out of power in UP as they fear that if it forms government, then it will come to power at the Centre as well in 2019, when next Lok Sabha polls are due.
He insisted that SP remains the main rival to the BJP. “We consider SP as our main rival. Still, our party will get a landslide victory in UP and form the next government. We expect 300 plus seats,” he said.
UP has 403-member Assembly. “We will rid the state of SP-BSP. For UP, they are like Rahu and Ketu (considered malevolent planets in astrology). Their misrule has ruined the state. Development took a backseat during their governments in the last 15 years,” he said.
Asked about kep poll planks for the BJP, Maurya said, “Good governance, development and making UP the numero uno state in the country.”
On the contentious issue of “triple talaq” which has prompted Muslim bodies to accuse the BJP of tinkering with Islamic personal laws, Maurya said his party considers “triple talaq” an injustice to Muslim women.
“We appeal to Muslim women and others opposing triple talaq to support BJP. We are getting support from many of them,” he said.
The 47-year-old Lok Sabha member, who comes from a politically crucial backward community, also rejected allegations decisions like surgical strikes across the border and demonetisation were made keeping in mind the coming elections.
Noting that many assembly elections have been held since the BJP formed government at the Centre in 2014, he said rival parties lack substantive issues to attack it.
“They have no real issue are opposing us for just for the sake of opposition,” Maurya said.
He claimed that the party’s ‘Parivartan Yatras’ across the state have drawn huge support.
“We are getting support from all communities. Where we were expecting 2,000 people, we are witnessing a turnout of 20,000. It reflects the faith people have reposed on us,” he

said.
Rubbishing the opposition’s claims that Modi’s rally in Lucknow scheduled for December 24 was cancelled as the party fearing poor turn-out, he said, “Nothing has been cancelled. It has been re-scheduled and the fresh dates will be announced soon after our Parivartan Yatras end on December 24.”"

In 2005, Imran and Naaish were wed in Lucknow by a woman qazin. She was Syeda Hameed, also a member of the Planning Commission then. Hameed recalls the incident as “a paradigm shift, unheard of in India, of women getting into a strictly male space”.
In the past three decades, the Muslim community has been seeing several such initiatives within on questions related to women and personal law. The Lucknow-based All India Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB), which came into being in 2005, has been trying to secure Muslim women rights both within the parameters of Islamic courts and, less often, through regular courts.
AIMWPLB president Shaista Amber says, “I felt Muslim women need specific attention for the first time back in 1997-98, when there was a case in Lucknow. A father was raping his two daughters and when we turned to the Darul Qaza (the family personal law court), we got no relief. I was struck by how those in burqa and those with beards faced a double problem. In regular courts, they face plenty of prejudice and are told to go to Muslim family courts, while in Darul Qaza, often flawed interpretations are made of Islamic law, denying them justice. That is when I wondered that if a section of the maulanas is going to uphold a particular interpretation of one school of Islam that upholds things like instantaneous triple talaq etc, where will we get justice?”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In Mumbai, a section of Muslim reformers, led by the late Asghar Ali Engineer and Flavia Agnes, has been trying to get a model nikah-nama accepted, which tries to rule out triple talaq and to settle the meher or alimony at reasonable and realistic levels in the marriage document itself.
Irfan Engineer, Engineer’s son who has taken up his work, says, “The Shah Bano case was a quiet watershed for Muslims, who wanted things to change but felt (afraid of) falling into the trap of the Hindutva right trying to use this to tarnish Islam. The view we arrived at was that we cannot allow the Hindutva right to be replaced by the tyranny of the Muslim right.”
Irfan adds that while he agrees with courts helping Muslim women get relief, the point to be noted was that “triple talaq is not considered legit in most Islamic countries and even sizeable sections of Muslims here. Islam stands for equality, social justice, liberty and dignity for all. We have to interpret it rightly.”
The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, based in Mumbai, has been taking up issues concerning women in Islam and standing by an enlightened interpretation of Islam. It organises “hundreds of workshops to raise awareness” and takes up cases in courts. The Andolan has also been active in pushing Haji Ali dargah to reopen its doors to women.
In Tamil Nadu, D Sharifa Khanam runs an organisation called STEPS for the development of Muslim women.
The Maharashtra-based Bebaak Collective is an umbrella outfit, set up in 2013, with Muslim women’s organisations from 14 states agitating for gender justice in accordance with secular laws, without reference to religion.
Speak Out on FGM and SAHIYO are Bohra women organisations trying to stop the religious practice of female genital mutilation among the Shi’as.
Even the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), set up in 1973 with the mandate to safeguard Muslim personal law, and which has opposed Shayara Banu’s petition, is not what it was 30 years ago. Now, it has 40 women members all over India.
Explaining the AIMPLB stand in Shayara Banu case, Uzma Naheed, who is part of the AIMPB executive, says, “We are opposed to courts jumping in and adjudicating on matters they do not perhaps fully comprehend in terms of our suras and other practices.”
Lawyer M R Shamshad says the Shariat Act was enacted in 1939 and subsequent pledges made to the community in the Constitution “give Muslims and other religious minorities the right to live by their personal laws. The attempt to have a Uniform Civil Code is in Article 44, which is just a directive principle.”
After the experience of the 1980s, when issues such as triple talaq and polygamy ended up as political football for the RSS and the BJP, Muslim women and other organisations are wary of raising the stakes on these matters, especially in the prevailing political environment. At the same time, this allows a section of the clerics to close ranks and fight against any court-mandated reform. Thirty-one years on, Shah Bano’s shadow is long."

Such a situation has emerged that it seems the government is focused on only this issue and that there is no other issue troubling Muslims,” JIH chief Maulana Syed Jalaluddin Umari told reporters in Delhi. Umari, also vice president of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), said that no one endorses ‘triple talaq in one sitting’, but stressed that there is no provision in the personal laws which leads to exploitation of women.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Last year, five crore Muslims, including women mostly, made submission to the Law Commission saying there is no problem with personal laws. “They told the commission about their other problems. But despite that it appears the government is focusing on only this issue (of triple talaq),” he added. He said there were several misconceptions about Muslim personal laws.
AIMPLB member Mohammed Jafar, who accompanied Umari during the briefing, said the JIH will hold the mass outreach programme, organising 700 public meetings and as many symposiums on gender justice in parts of the country.
“We will hold programmes in capitals of states. There will be press briefings, we will distribute pamphlets to community members…we will reach out to villagers and slum dwellers,” he said, adding that they would also reach out to non-Muslims. To a question, Umari sought to suggest the percentage of Muslims seeking divorce in proportion with their populace is lesser than that of other religions. He, however, did not elaborate on that point.
The JIH also released a booklet titled ‘Muslim Personal Law: Moral and Legal Issues’ during the briefing and announced launch of a mobile application ‘Muslim Personal Law Awareness Campaign’ (MPLAC). The application will help enlighten community members, it said. The Centre had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism."

Having recently returned from Bangladesh after attending the 20th council of the Awami League, newly-nominated Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly said that Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had expressed concern over terror activities being fostered in West Bengal.
“I had attended the council along with our party vice-president Dr Vinay Shahasrabuddhe on October 22 and 23. The programme was held to foster better relations between Bangladesh and its neighbouring countries. Hasina also met us personally and in the closed door meeting, she had clearly said that there were youths in her country, in the bordering areas of India and Bangladesh, who were being funded and trained for terror activities in Bengal,” Ganguly said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Ganguly also said that Hasina had not only talked about zero tolerance for terrorism, but was acting on it as well. “She had told us that she would not allow anyone in Bangladesh to stay there and carry out terror activities across the border. The message she has sent out is that if any criminal was getting a helping hand from Bengal in carrying out anti-terror activities, they were not wanted in Bangladesh.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP leader also said that members of minority sections in Bangladesh, who had been through a lot of trouble and torture in the recent past, were better off now.
“We have been told that most offenders who unleashed terror on minorities there had been booked and minorities are living a better life now,” she said.
State BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who was also present at the occasion, referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on triple talaq and said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had kept mum on the issue to keep her Muslim votes intact. “While the PM expressed the plight of Muslim women who suffered the pangs of triple talaq, sometimes even said over the phone, the CM here, who is a lady herself, had chosen to keep silent on the issue. She has not made her stand clear because she is worried about her Muslim vote bank here,” Ghosh said.
He also reacted to Mamata’s concern over the increase in communal clashes across the state and said, “We have compiled around 15 cases of recent communal clashes during Durga Puja and Moharram and sent it to the office of the home minister in New Delhi. We have also found out that the chief minister’s office here had news of 89 instances where members of both the communities have been at loggerheads, but those were swept under the carpet. All she does is the politics of appeasing a particular community,” said Ghosh.
Talking about pitching candidates for the upcoming bypolls at Tamluk and Cooch Behar Lok Sabha and Monteswar Assembly seats on November 19, he said a list of probable candidates has been sent to the Centre and the central committee would decide the final names.
Asked if Congress and Left Front fighting alone would be of any help to the BJP here, he said, “The Congress has left doors for discussion open, so there is a possibility of a last-minute alliance. But we are not concerned about that. They only have a handful of MLAs left with them. All the others have gone to TMC. Soon the two parties will lose existence. BJP has an edge whether or not there is an alliance,” he said."

The cover story in Organiser gives “voice to some of the voiceless” Muslim women who have been victims of triple talaq. It quotes a 31-year-old woman who says her husband divorced her because she failed to “give him a son”. The article says, “Year after year she continued to conceive to fulfill the dream of Shahid and his family but she failed” before she received the “punishment for the fault of not providing a son”. “I gave birth to four daughters… he left me with my four daughters when I needed him the most,” the article quotes her. A 24-year-old woman is quoted saying that her husband’s family abused her. Once after she had finished namaz in the “holy month of Ramazan”, “Gulzar started beating me without any reason,” she says, adding that one day, without any reason, “he told me that I am giving you talaq”. The husband of another woman “used to drink regularly”. “Once he came at night and started beating me and said talaq talaq talaq,” the woman says. “You move around any Muslim-dominated locality and you will find a number of such cases,” the article says, underlining the “resentment among Muslim women about this gender discrimination”. It also quotes a “national study” that claims “more than 90 per cent Muslim women want triple talaq to be abolished”.
“The failure of the Muslim religious clergy to address the issue from a woman’s perspective is also a major problem,” it says, noting that the “time has come for Muslim women” to “raise (their) voice against these practices”.
Blame it on NGOshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is a matter of concern, the editorial in Panchjanya says, that the credibility of NGOs has been depleted due to the “bad deeds of some institutions”. “Unkempt beard, big bindi, kurta or a fairly costly jhola with Adivasi print —- none of these now reflect social service,” the editorial argues. “The society now views such persons with suspicion,” it says, noting that the sources of their funding are being discussed. “This simplicity has enough money,” it notes.
It quotes a study by the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies saying “if all NGOs are to be clubbed together and seen as a country, then their economy would be the fifth (largest) in the world”. Surprisingly, “India has an NGO for every 400 persons”. “Around 33 lakh NGOs! The biggest democracy of the world does not have even these many pooling booths,” it says. Not all NGOs, according to the editorial, are involved in suspicious tasks. The responsibility of this “mess in the sector”, says the editorial, lies on “those spineless” activists, who “gleam in Page 3 parties and TV debates”. They are mere “tools to meet the agendas of others”.
In the name of service, they are involved in a conspiracy, the editorial concludes.
Bullish on Jallikattu
An editorial in Organiser on the Jallikattu protests says that “many tried to interpret it as Tamil Spring”, “some even tried to equate it with the anti-Hindi movement of the 1960s and attempted to give it a secessionist colour”, but it was not so. “It was not about just a sport or Tamil pride,” it says, underlining that “similar celebrations are there all over Bharat closely associated with the agrarian ecosystem, whether it is Kambala (buffalo race) in Karnataka or bullock cart competition in other states”. It slams “progressive and anti-liberalisation people”, who “forget that these traditions” are “important in holding the rural economies together”. “Occupy Marina Beach was more about reclaiming the Bharatiya thought process,” it says.
The Cauvery water sharing issue and the death of J. Jayalalithaa, it says, “has provided enough fodder to destabilise established norms in Tamil Nadu’s polity”. The ban on Jallikattu “provided a golden opportunity to play the regional identity card” as “secessionists along with jihadists immediately tried to exploit the situation and reignite the artificial Aryan-Dravidian divide”. The RSS has always stood by “the indigenous sport”, it notes. The editorial slams “organisations like PETA that are working for the agenda driven from outside Bharat”."

Additional Solicitor General (ASG), Pinky Anand on Saturday welcomed the move of the Centre on triple talaq and said that such practices are extremely discriminatory and has to be stopped.
“The factors of triple talaq are extremely discriminatory. It is against the interest of women. I think this is the high time this has happened and the government has taken positive step to come forwards and has given affidavit in the Supreme Court regarding the case that Triple talaq is unconstitutional,” Anand told ANI.

Anand said that the human dignity and the right of life are involved in these matters which are not compromisable by any personal situation of any case adding that such practices must be stopped. Friday, the Centre filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Triple Talaq and polygamy validity.
According to the affidavit, the Centre said that there is no reason women in India should be denied their constitutional rights.
“Validity of Triple Talaq and polygamy have to be seen in light of gender justice, equality and dignity of women,” stated the Centre in its affidavit.
The Government also said that polygamy and triple talaq do not adhere to constitutional values and, therefore, cannot be accepted. The Muslim law board had earlier claimed that triple talaq is a ‘personal law’ and, hence, cannot be modified by the Centre."

He was answering questions related to the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya. The BJP, in its manifesto, has said the Ram temple issue will be settled as per law and under provisions of the Constitution.

Claiming that exodus of Hindus from western UP is an issue, Adityanath said the region could turn into another Kashmir if the SP government returned to power. “BJP was raising such issues in public interest and not to polarise voters ahead of elections… These issues were raised in the past and would be raised again after elections… The situation is worrisome in western UP… people complain that they feel unsafe and their problems are not being redressed by local authorities,” he added.
“The way exodus has occurred in Kairana, Kandhala and over two dozen other towns and villages in western UP, it is alarming. If a government that nurtures appeasement continues in UP, there will be no delay in this place becoming another Kashmir… Expecting security and an atmosphere of safety is meaningless from the current government, which had initiated the process to withdraw cases against anti-national elements, responsible for terror incidents in UP,” said Adityanath.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He added: “A serious problem of exodus has arisen in sensitive areas of western UP because of communal violence… people were feeling insecure because of hooligans, mafia and their gangs, who are being sheltered by the state government. Only BJP has promised to take stern action against such anarchy… to prevent exodus and to form anti-romeo squads for safety of women and closure of slaughter houses to save live stock.”
On triple talaq, Adityanath said a discussion on women empowerment should cater to all — from every caste and religion. “Because if one part of the body is weak, entire body gets affected,” he claimed, referring to BJP’s poll promise that it will take opinion of Muslim women on the issue and present the same before the Supreme Court.
On BJP’s poll promise of shutting down illegal and mechanised slaughter houses, Adityanath said: “Illegal slaughter houses cause pollution and were hurdles in livestock preservation… Export of meat to foreign countries will stop automatically when mechanised slaughter houses are shut.” The MP said the Modi government, in the last two-and-a-half years, has launched several schemes to benefit every citizen without giving importance or ignoring any particular caste or religion. “But it is unfortunate that still our government is called communal. Those who drafted every scheme and programme in the last 14 years in UP, giving priority to castes and communities, they call themselves secular. I feel there is a need to decide a criteria to decide what is secular and secularism in the state,” he added."

THE BJP will be initiating a movement against the “injustice” that Muslim women were facing in the city on November 18, in which several NGOs, Muslim women and organisations working for them will participate, the party’s state unit president Dilip Ghosh said on Monday. “We will begin the movement in Kolkata and it will be spread across the state slowly. The idea is to expose Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who had been trying to create a pro-Muslim image in Bengal but in fact was working against the interests of Muslim women,” Ghosh said at a press conference.

The BJP leader alleged that the chief minister had come to power riding on the support of fundamentalist leaders. “Siddiqullah Chowdhury, who had been heading a fundamentalist organisation, contested the MLA election with a TMC ticket and as soon as he won, he was inducted into the cabinet of ministers. This shows Mamata’s patronage towards fundamentalist leaders like him. For the sake of vote banks she can support anti-national activities or go against the Constitution. By backing Chowdhury, she has proved that TMC patronises anti-national activities. We are keeping a tab on the activities of Jamaat and if need be we will inform the Centre about the anti-national activities of the organisation,” Ghosh said, adding that Muslim men found it convenient to get rid of their wives, who are left in misery while their children very often resorted to illegal activities because of improper upbringing.
“We have roped in some NGOs, some Muslim women and Muslim women’s organisations who will join the protest programme,” Ghosh said. Slamming TMC leaders and Mamata for supporting triple talaq, Ghosh said, “It is sad to see that the CM, who is a woman, is against giving equal rights to women in the state. Slowly but surely, Muslims are seeing through the trick that Mamata is playing to woo them.” He alleged that Mamata’s “politics” was creating a “communal divide” among the people of Bengal. Interestingly, a three-day convention of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is also slated to begin on November 18. Muslim leaders opined that the BJP was organising its movement at the same time purposely to “spark a communal riot” here."

There may be a long wait ahead before the Supreme Court expresses its views on the Constitutional legitimacy of triple talaq and polygamy in the Muslim community. The next hearing on the matter, which involves Muslim women petitioners, religious organisations, rights groups and the government, was slated to be held on October 18. But the hearing is now expected to be deferred indefinitely owing to the setting up of a seven judge-bench that would commence adjudication on a batch of Constitution matters on the same day.

The seven-judge bench will be headed by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur, who also leads the bench that has been hearing petitions on the validity of triple talaq and polygamy. The notification for setting up the seven-judge bench was issued on the website of the Supreme Court on September 24. The petitions on triple talaq were last heard by the CJI-led bench on September 6, when the central government was given four weeks to convey its stand on the Constitutional validity of these practices.
According to the list of business issued by the court registry, the CJI-led bench shall hear the other cases only if the Constitution bench cannot sit for some reason. In the last two months, a nine-judge bench, headed by the CJI, had examined the validity of state legislation on entry tax. These hearings are rarely deferred since larger benches are set up only after a detailed arrangement and scheduling of cases by all the judges on the bench.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Besides, the court’s Diwali holidays are scheduled from October 29 to November 4, apart from other public holidays in November and December, and weekend offs. Then there are the Christmas and New Year holidays from December 19 to January 1. On January 3, 2017, CJI Thakur is expected to retire, and this would lead to the constitution of a new bench to examine the matter.
Even on working weeks, Mondays and Fridays are fixed for miscellaneous matters and hence, detailed arguments in this batch of cases are unlikely to take place. Submitting its affidavit on October 7, the Union Law Ministry argued that polygamy and triple talaq should be done away with, asserting that these practices “cannot be regarded as essential or integral part of the religion”.
The government stated that the absence of reforms in the community in the last 65 years have left Muslim women “extremely vulnerable, both socially as well as financially”, and maintained that triple talaq and polygamy impacted a woman’s status and her right to live with confidence and dignity.
In August, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), in its reply to the petitions, had defended the validity of triple talaq, saying that if the practice is discontinued, a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her.
”If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, the legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive,” the AIMPLB’s affidavit had stated."

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to file before it the report of a committee which was constituted earlier to look into the aspects of personal laws relating to marriage, divorce and custody prevalent in various religious minorities, including Muslims.
A bench comprising Chief justice T S Thakur and Justice U U Lalit asked Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to submit the report within six weeks in the court.

The bench also asked the Ministry of Minority Affairs to file its response to the petition filed by one Shayara Bano challenging the constitutionality of Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and nikah halala.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Talaq-e–bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing more than one talaq in a single tuhr (the period between two menstruations), or in a tuhr after coitus, or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple-talaq).
Meanwhile, the bench directed the apex court registry to make available within six weeks the copy of judicial records of a petition on the issue which was taken note of as a separate petition by it.
The Supreme Court had earlier this month sought response of the Centre on Bano’s plea challenging constitutionality of Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 in so far as it seeks to recognise and validate polygamy, triple talaq and nikah halala, and had tagged the matter with a similar suo motu petition."
"1617716967-17","https://indianexpress.com/page/123/?s=Triple+talaq","Can you see the ferment within?","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/can-you-see-the-ferment-within/","Can you see the ferment within?","August 5, 2003","It seems that Indian Muslim women — admittedly, not all — are on the fast track. Thanks mainly to awareness owing to education. Though still grappling with the travails of a ghettoised past, these women are trying to balance the challenges of modernity with the demands of tradition. The change is gradual, cautious but sure.
A study by the Friends for Education shows that the Muslim girls’ result is better than that of the boys in the school board examinations. Not only are they breaking out of their cloisters, they are even demanding their rights — both Quranic and social. Islamic scripture has it that it is the duty of every Muslim man and woman to attain knowledge equally. At the time of Prophet Mohammed, women were exhorted to act as Imams and lead the congregational prayers. He never tired of repeating, “A Muslim must not hate his wife and if he be displeased with one quality in her, let him be pleased with another that is good”. And “Paradise lies at the feet of the mother.”
There have been some landmark judgments in the past for ameliorating the lot of the Muslim women like the one a couple of years ago by the Mumbai High Court. In that historic judgment a full bench comprising justices B.H. Marllapalle, N.V. Dabholkar and N.H. Patil stated that the divorce between a Muslim couple will now have to be convincingly proved in a court of law under the Indian Evidence Act. Earlier, the same Mumbai High Court through its two-judge bench of justices A.B. Sawant and T.K. Chandrashekhar, declared yet another landmark judgment after it asked the defendant Fakhruddin Mubarak to provide maintenance to his divorced wife Zaitunbi till she was in iddat, that is, till she was to get remarried. Things are changing, but, of course, it will take time.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey, laws have been made that if a person wishes to remarry, he has to take the permission of the court. Even in Malaysia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia now, Muslim women have challenged the orthodox society by taking to modern education in spite of following strict sexual segregation. They may be veiled, but they go to the university.
Because of the increasing incidents of polygamy, the Islamic court of Dar-ul-Qaza has laid down the condition that polygamy will be allowed only if a person shows sufficient cause for it and satisfies the authorities that he will be able to bear the additional economic burden and will not divorce her or thereby injure his health. Otherwise his marriage can be annuled.
Muslims must mobilise themselves to find solutions to these problems that afflict them. First, the lack of education that exists in a much higher percentage than is found in other communities. And second, the discriminatory treatment of women in the application of Muslim personal laws. But this does not mean toeing the line of the Muslim Personal Law Board, a platform of opportunistic and lip-serving people! The fault lies in the lop-sided and erroneous interpretation of personal laws and iniquitous and one-sided provisions in civil laws. The Muslim Personal Law Board, though not having any following among Muslims, about a year ago considered some drastic changes in matters pertaining to Muslim marriages and talaq (divorce) in a single sitting, mehr and polygamy. These deliberations were in vain as the orthodox members overpowered the ones with enlightened views. A new nikahnaama (marriage contract) was to be framed where both husband and wife were to sign that no separation would take place by announcement of triple talaq in one sitting. In this new contract, the bridegroom was supposed to sign a clear undertaking that if for some reason he had to resort to separation, he had to do so over three sittngs spread over a period of three menstrual cycles, as is also the diktat in the Shariah (Muslim law). But as was expected, the goods never got delivered on account of those with bigoted and myopic views on the subject.
The time has come for Muslims to think of uplifting their womenfolk by providing what is mentioned in their holy scripture and responding to the need of the hour. The anti-clockwise attitude of Indian Muslims has actually taken away from their women the rights that the Quran has granted them."

When Bollywood stars are afraid to talk about anything beyond their films, Saif Ali Khan holds forth on a plethora of burning topics ranging from the rise of Nationalism in India, his identity as a Muslim, living in a Hindu state, Triple Talaq, Kashmir and understanding the construct of religion. He also has the most balanced opinion on the Sonu Nigam azaan row, accepting that he thought the tweet was “bit aggressive, initally”.
He also has a word of caution for the actors who use steroids to get six-pack abs in two weeks: “Your pen**es may fall off!”

 
On his production house
I have taken a break for now from producing films in order to focus a bit more on acting. But I intend to come back to it eventually. I have a friend in Los Angeles who is a line producer, with access to rights to a number of films and TV shows. I should look at the family a little more than I have in the past. Maybe Kareena (Kapoor) can do a female-centric TV show that we can produce.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But there are a number of things that are a natural extension of self. It’s just about working a bit harder. I’d like to even open a club perhaps, not a nightclub, but eating, drinking, music kind of a place… like minded people, and doing up Pataudi and the new flat. I quite enjoy doing up places, to create an atmosphere. Maybe to do it professionally will be a good idea.
On speaking up
To keep a low profile is important, and you wonder if there is a need. Salman Rushdie thought he had the freedom of speech and said incendiary things. A fatwa was passed that changed his life. He didn’t enjoy that. Freedom of speech is one thing but you learn that certain people will kill you if you abuse their religion. Sitting in the comforts of our living rooms, it’s different; various worlds intersect in India.
On Sonu Nigam’s comment regarding azaans
Don’t know who you are offending. At one level I agree, the lesser sound the better, there should be certain decibel levels allowed across religious practices. I also understand the amplification of the sound during azaan comes from insecurity. Not just here but also in Israel apparently where three different religions co-exist. It’s been written about so I believe it’s the same. As a minority, you would like to make your presence felt and hopefully accepted. If someone says that it should be extinguished, it will make some people little uncomfortable. As a precursor to some sort of holocaust, it’s the first thing you think of. There’s a bit of fear there. It’s fine to express your views on the decibel levels. I think that tweet was a bit aggressive though, initially. And I do think religion should be a private affair and we should be a secular country.
On social media
There is a basic advantage to it, Twitter for example, should be about spreading the news. But it’s become about becoming the news. Initially, when someone criticises me on social media, I think it’s coming from a spiritual and intellectual equal. But then I realise maybe not, that they are not as open minded as I am. And I am not interested in the opinion of these faceless, nameless people. And I don’t want everyone’s approval. Also, the fame such people gather on Twitter is a surrogate form of stardom. It comes from an interesting comment on perhaps another celebrity. It’s not real talent being sold.
On fairness products and racism
I think I have endorsed them a couple of times and I am told they are the largest selling things. But it’s not a stand I have felt particularly strong about. Everyone in this country is obsessed with fair skin. It’s the first thing people say when a child is born. And it’s important that Abhay Deol’s voice on the subject be heard. Perhaps we all know somewhere that selling that product is wrong, and somewhere we wish we took a different stand but we don’t. If you don’t sell it, someone else would. There should maybe be a law against it. Without a law how do you hope people won’t bleach their faces?

On ‘white’ background dancers
When these foreigners came into the industry, there was a reason. The Indian background dancers used to be very unfit. But yes, this pricing and business and grades based on their skin colour is ridiculous. And it reflects a truth that might be a bit uncomfortable.
On the need for religion to adapt to the times
The idea of god and religion has changed and evolved over centuries. I am not an expert but I understand that at in the earlier part of the last century existentialists such as Camus, Sartre and Nietzsche talked about the death of god and a different kind of an awakening. So the future of god is something I am very interested in. What do we need to create so that it will fulfill the need of the hour, because it may not be the old one anymore. With science and philosophy advancing in this century, it’s no longer the centrepiece of our life. What did Freud, or was it Nietzsche who said, ‘There is a god shaped hole in our consciousness today.’ This is of course not for the people for whom religion is the opium of, who haven’t thought about it at all ever.
On Nationalism
If you look at people from a generation ago, a Hindu who would say adaab seemed more accepting, made you feel a little more comfortable, sophisticated and kinder. It’s the India we grew up in. Nationalism is amazing and important for development. But is that the same as Hinduism? I don’t think so. In a country that has been secular, there are minorities, it will make them uncomfortable. On the other hand, my freedoms have been afforded to me based on economics. So it doesn’t apply to me. To me, I am happy living in a Hindu state also. Make the same law for everyone.

 
On Uniform Civil Code and Triple Talaq
Why should we see people as different? I know the argument, that the criminal law is the same but the civil law varies. But of course there should be one law for the land. Also on Triple Talaq. I have been married in the past, I have had a nikaah, but that’s also because my ex-wife mother is also a Muslim. And also because we ran away and got married. But when I got divorced, I just couldn’t think Triple Talaq was the way. There are responsibilities, financial one has towards the wife and children. These aren’t just divorce arrangements, but so you sleep right. My arrangement expired when Sara turned 18 but I haven’t stopped taking care of her and Ibrahim, to be a father, emotionally and financially. It’s not a contract or a religious out. I don’t agree with it because I haven’t followed it, I could have. Yes Muslims say it was started at a time to give women rights but things are different now. Indian Constitution does try to address this with the Special Marriage Act. There is a way if people are willing to follow. Kareena (Kapoor) and I followed the Special Marriage Act. I think times have changed, and I have too. Although I had no interest back then either, to convert anyone. I think Taimur should have the freedom tomorrow to be a Buddhist if he wants, or an atheist.
On Islamophobia
It’s so scary. We have had phobias against religion. The Jews have been historically persecuted. And anti-semitism has been used by the Western civilization as a political, philosophical and economic tool, to treat someone else as ‘the other’. And after the holocaust, it’s scary when people say Islamophobia because it feels like you will be persecuted or discriminated against no matter how you are. And I am not religious but as a kid, I was so proud to be a Muslim. One used to think of the Mughals, Turkey, calligraphy, art etc. And now it’s this, which is a far cry.
But I’ll tell you, there is no such thing as the Muslim or the Jew. We create the construct of the Muslim and give it certain characteristics, that he does this or that. But we are individuals. Our views will be different, even on religion. It’s scary when we are all are called ‘the Muslim’ because it implies we all have the same beliefs and characteristics that can be easily summed up.
On students’ movements in India
It’s fabulous. Kanhaiya Kumar’s intellectually regal behaviour when he was released, and the speech he gave was phenomenal. It’s a schizophrenic situations and all voices are important right now.
On Pakistan
Our families in Bhopal and Pataudi were divided by partition so we have a first-hand experience of what that was about. So when some people talk of a war as an option in a nuclear age, it’s frightening. (laughs) And nobody is talking about how China is looking pretty aggressive these days. They have changed the names of places in Arunachal Pradesh. We probably don’t like to admit there is a stronger neighbour around the corner. Because we think we can easily bash up Pakistan, apart from the nuclear missiles that are pointed towards us.
Also jokes aside, it’s a complicated situation. And the fact that Pakistan exists really undermines the Muslim situation in India. The obvious reaction will be that why don’t you move there if you like Pakistan so much. So the people living here also have to be pro Uniform Civil Code.
On the ban on Pakistani actors
Make up your mind, make it a law if you want to. (Laughs) Also, there is a sense of exotic to them because they are from the forbidden land, like Fawad Khan. If they were from India, that would remove that extra glamour from them. Maybe they are just usual but there is a Mata Hari sense of a foreigner about them.
I can understand the ban. On one hand you are playing nice, casting each other in movies and playing cricket, and on the other hand they cut five people’s heads — who are ‘they’ though, I don’t know. We don’t know how much to believe. A lot of what happens between the two countries is covert, there are a lot of underhand dealings and trade etc. And then there is an espionage situation then you don’t know what’s really happening? Is it a grave misunderstanding? Or is the bad, bad Pakistan trying to just hang someone? Or does this guy is really a destabilising factor? How do you say he should be released or not? Of course as a humanitarian you don’t want anyone to die. Everyone tells you even in a spy movie that if you are caught, you are on your own. But you don’t know what will happen? It’s statecraft. Will they really hang him, or are they just saying so? Or will India trade him for someone else?
On Kashmir
It’s not an easy situation, and I feel bad for the Kashmiris. We can’t be jingoistic about it unless we are taught to understand and view it objectively. I don’t know what was really happening when the man was tied to the jeep by the army. The army is in there, it’s a war zone. We cannot tell them sitting in our drawing rooms what’s right and wrong. Kashmir is a complicated issue. My personal view is that the two governments have reached an agreement that this kind of a situation should be kept at it, because it cannot be better or solved and hopefully it won’t get worse. It’s insolvable legally, second probably to Lebanon or Israel.
The Dogras when they were awarded Kashmir, they were not the maharajas they became. And the fact that it’s a Hindu maharaja and a Muslim population, the insurgency into PoK, the plebiscite with Pandit Nehru that never happened, the people were never asked where they want to go because there was a fear that it wouldn’t go the way we wanted it. And the Kashmiris know that in this whole deal the people who have not been asked are them, so they want their own freedom, which is also not feasible really because from Khalistan to kashmir, separatists have been trying to break away from the Indian Union ever since it was formed.
On cosmetic surgeries and use of steroids
There are actors looking fitter than ever. Though am not sure I approve of overuse of steroids (laughs). That seems the only way an average Indian can get ribbed in two weeks in the gym. They better be careful because their pe***es might just fall off. The new six pack Indian has sold his what-not to the devil in exchange for an eight pack. It’s the new Faustian pact! And they don’t care if it makes them look good.
On daughter Sara’s acting aspiration
I told her once try to concentrate on the art. Look at people like Aamir Khan, you can make your own rules. Don’t get caught up with what it seems to be about. You can take a script and check into a Venice hotel by the canal, read your script, think etc. Be creative, see the world. If you don’t get caught up in the tiny little politics but push creativity. The compromises define you. My first movie I was told if I didn’t stop seeing the girl I was, I will be chucked out. I said okay chuck me out. But I bet a lot of people would, if they were told by the king of Dharshraj (laughs) to do that. Not that they would.
I know Sara is so bright, and having conversations with her on art and history when she was at Columbia University was so rich. I’d like her to be enriching. But this is what she always wanted to do. But so much of it is fear and insecurity. But as a parent, I know you don’t own them, you can only provide them a good education, send them to a good school and university. I am from the Khalil Gibran school of parenting, like my father, am there if they want to talk to me but won’t tell them what they should do. Ibrahim understands it’s very competitive in the industry but then which career isn’t these days. A BA from a good university will fetch you nothing, you need an MBA.
On being a star in changing times and hating selfies
The age of privilege is threatening to be over. It’s scary because we don’t understand anything else. We all grew up reading about positions of power, the World War, the Queen of Britain, the Pope, such titles of privilege. But the more Arab Springs take place, you see a middle class obliterating the hierarchy of royalty and creating it’s own. Social media, Instagram is also making them more available, people like Carey Grant or Mr Bachchan. And to be a star and be in a queue in an airport is a curse. Because you don’t get paid enough to fly private so you are attacked and people will want to take selfies. And it’s too intrusive. I dislike selfies. There’s something very aggressive about it. Kids I never say no to, that’s more innocent. But stars you know, they should be up there, they should be looking down from the galaxy, they cannot be standing in the same line as you (laughs out loud). Or change the word for it, call it ‘representative of people’ or something, become a communist, it’s what we are after all. And everyone asks stars but no one asks industrialists or politicians where the money is coming from.
On Award Wapsi
I wouldn’t give up my awards, the National Award or the Padma Shri, but senior filmmakers like Kundan Shah and Saeed Mirza who protested against the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as the head of the Film and Television Institute of India. I think that’s fair, it’s allowed in any democracy.
On his National Award and Padma Shri

When I found out about my National Award for Hum Tum, I was having breakfast in my bed in London. Mom called me and asked me to take the first flight back. I told her I didn’t want to because I’d have to buy my own ticket. Also, I have my father’s blood in me, so I thought I didn’t deserve it — although I think differently about it now. I did come back and it was nice. But there is also a story with the Padma award. I had asked my father if I could use the family letterhead. And he said to use the letterhead while I am alive is to denigrate it, like the Padma Awards have become. And a week later, they gave it to me. So I called him and told him I don’t think I deserve it, there are so many people senior to me. So he said, ‘I don’t think you are in the position to say no to the Government of India just yet.’ So I went."

Holding that such crucial issues should not be looked through prism of electoral benefit, the Chief Spokesperson of the government also rejected the opposition’s criticism that surgical strikes were being politicised.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Government does not consider it (triple talaq) as a religious matter. It is a question of gender sensitivity. It is wrong to say that we are interfering in Muslim issues.
“The same Indian Parliament, the same political system had brought Hindu Code Bill, Divorce Act, banning Hindu Marriage Act, banning dowry and Sati practice, all these things are done by Indian Parliament,” Naidu told PTI in an interview.
Making it clear that broad consensus will be required for bringing Uniform Civil Code, he said the allegations that Triple Talaq is a backdoor entry for the UCC was unjustified.

“We are not discussing about the common civil code or uniform civil code as of now. The Law Commission has issued a questionnaire and asked people to react.
“You cannot have a uniform Civil Code without a broad consensus. You have to work and move in that direction,” he said hoping that the Supreme Court will come out with the right decision on the issue of triple talaq.
Naidu said these sensitive issues should not be linked to polls as the elections are like festivals in India which keep coming now and then.
Defending the government affidavit in the Supreme Court on triple talaq issue, he said nobody then said it (Sati) was a Hindu practice that government was interfering in that.
“Somebody might have said it also. But in collective wisdom, the entire country has moved further. We have reformed ourselves. Similarly, when the practice is going on which is discriminatory, which is doing injustice to women, we think it should end,” Naidu said.
He said it was Muslim women and organisations which were demanding end of triple talaq who had gone to the Supreme Court.
Referring to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution that speaks against discrimination, the Minister said, “The Government of India wants every religion, every personal law to be in accordance with that. And if the society transforms itself, it’s always better.”
Naidu said divesting a woman by simply, saying talaq three times was totally against the principles of natural justice and the practise must end.
“This debate was not started by us. Somebody went to court and the Supreme Court while discussing the issue wanted to know the views of the Government. And the government has filed an affidavit saying that our view is that triple talaq is unjust, unfair, uncivilised and saying it must come to an end.
“That’s what we have said. How is it connected with UP elections,” he said. Replying to a raft of questions on Ram temple issue, Naidu said, “People of India want a brilliant temple at the birth place of Rama but how do you go about it. You have to have an agreement between contending parties or you will have to abide by the legal verdict which is taking too long.
He maintained that as far as government is concerned, government and political parties have no role in constructing a temple.
“You can facilitate or remove obstructions or create obstructions like what Mulayamji had done earlier,” he said.
The Minister said as far as government and BJP are concerned UP elections are not going to be fought on the Rama Janambhoomi or common civil code or triple talaq. “They are going to be fought on developmental issue.”
To a question that focus was now sought to be brought on these contentious issues, he shot back, “If you do not talk about it then it is said you have forgotten Ram. When you talk about them, then it is said Ram is remembered because of UP elections.”
Naidu said BJP was going to focus more on development and good governance in the campaign for UP polls, adding it does not mean that the party has given up on issues like Uniform Civil Code and Rama Janambhoomi.

On criticism by the Opposition parties of BJP trying to take political mileage from cross-LoC surgical strikes, Naidu reminded Congress of using Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s praise of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as Durga after the 1971 Indo-Pak war, for political gains. Naidu said leaders of the political parties were briefed and their queries were replied to by the army during an all party meeting on surgical strikes and all of them had gone back home happily. But raising questions over the strikes and seeking proof were “subsequent thoughts”.
On the surgical strikes, he said details of such nature are not divulged in national interests and they are not even questioned.
Asked about Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Khoon ki dalali’ comment, Naidu called it as an “immature” remark.
“Whoever made the comment, it was an injustice to the country, it was an injustice to himself. After the comment was made, he became unpopular. People have answered it,” said Naidu.
Asked about allegations that BJP has a role in the rift in the Samajwadi Party, Naidu said it has become fashionable for some people to blame the ruling party or RSS for anything.
“Good that they have not blamed RSS. It is an internal family problem. They are fighting among themselves openly. Where is BJP’s hand in it,” he asked.
Expressing confidence that BJP will emerge victorious in the assembly polls, he blamed SP for ruining the state. “We do not believe in fishing in troubled waters we believe in eating fish,” he said in a lighter vein.
Asked who is BJP’s number one rival in UP, he said SP, BSP and Congress were in the battle. He also compared the fight between UP CM Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal as a semi-final, saying “Let’s see who comes out victorious.”"

Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the Muslim community to find a proper solution for triple talaq, the Samajwadi Party criticized the former saying that he should also speak up on other issues which are being faced by the Muslim women.
“Prime Minister Modi should also focus on other problems of Muslim women. Muslim women are losing their husbands and son due to violence by Gau Rakshaks,” Samajwadi Party leader told ANI.
Earlier, Congress dubbed Prime Minister’s assertion as insignificant adding that he made the statement eyeing upcoming elections in Karnataka.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Prime Minister Modi made the statement eyeing upcoming elections in Karnataka. He has been doing this and will also continue to do in future. He is following the ideology of RSS. His speech does not hold any significance,” Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge told ANI.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the day appealed to the Muslim community to find proper solution to end the controversial practice of triple talaq.
Addressing the Basva festival, Prime Minister Modi told media, “I believe people from Muslim community would come up to solve the issue of triple talaq and act as savior to the Muslim women in this crucial period.”
He went on to say that there should be no discrimination in the country, adding that ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ is the motto of his government and it will fulfill promises made to the people without any discrimination."

A HIGH-LEVEL committee set up by the Central government to review the status of women in India has sought a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq or divorce, as well as polygamy.
The assessment of family laws, examined by The Indian Express, is part of a voluminous report submitted last year by the panel appointed by the previous UPA government. The report has not been released in the public domain.
On Monday, the Supreme Court, while hearing a plea on the divorce norms, directed the Centre to produce the report within six weeks. The apex court was hearing a plea by a Muslim woman from Uttarakhand against her triple talaq.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The report backs the demand for the ban on the grounds that such talaq renders “wives extremely vulnerable and insecure regarding their marital status”.
[related-post]
The panel has not only recommended specific amendments to the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939 but also suggested introducing provisions to provide for interim maintenance.
The report states that payment of maintenance to the wife and children must be made mandatory in the event of separation or divorce.
While the landmark Supreme Court Judgment of 1985 in the Shah Bano case recognised the Muslim woman’s right to maintenance, it was never codified in the Muslim personal law.
The report states: “All judges should be made aware of the manner in which the SC has interpreted the Muslim Law and has safeguarded the rights of Muslim women.”
It cites the examples of Shamin Ara vs State of UP where the apex court laid down strict Quranic injunctions for pronouncing talaq and the Shabana Bano vs Imran Khan case where it upheld the right to receive maintenance under section 125 of CRPC until the husband pays his wife lump-sum maintenance.
“Such progressive judgments are not known to all judges and magistrates adjudicating over the rights of Muslim women, hence due to ignorance of law many Muslim women are denied of their rights,” states the report. It also suggests changing many of the gender-discriminatory provisions under the Hindu and Christian laws.
“I have not seen the report, but any suggestion to ban triple talaq or polygamy is not acceptable to us. This will mean direct interference of the government in religious affairs as Sharia (Islamic law) is based on the Quran and Hadith, and its jurisprudence is strong as far as Islam is concerned. This would be against the Constitutional right to freedom of religion,” said Kamal Faruqui, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board that has been made a party to the Supreme Court petition.
The petition was filed by Shayara Bano who claimed that her husband gave her triple talaq after subjecting her to cruelty during the course of their marriage.
The petition states that instantaneous triple talaq has no foundation in the Quran and many Islamic nations such as Pakistan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia have banned or restricted such practices. It also points out that the personal laws of Hindus, Christians and Parsis have evolved over the years so as to prohibit the practice while Muslim women continue to be denied equal protection under law and from discrimination on the basis of their gender and religion.
The 14-member committee was constituted by the Ministry of Woman and Child Development under the UPA government in February 2012. It was reconstituted in May 2013 under its present chairperson Pam Rajput, founder director of Centre for Women’s Studies, Panjab University."

A constitution bench of the Supreme Court will soon begin hearing a host of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the so-called triple talaq. It is difficult to predict the outcome of this high-level judicial exercise, but will the apex court’s ruling one way or the other put an end to the tumult on the issue? Will the babel of voices condemning the scandalous practice or zealously defending status quo be silenced?
There are three issues before the court — triple talaq, halala and polygamy. The first two are interconnected — if a man wants to retain his triply divorced wife, this is allowed only after she is married to, and then divorced by, another man; faking such a drama is possible with the connivance of well-wishers. Triple divorce becomes a problem not for men who actually mean it and wish to instantly break their marriage for all time to come, but for hundreds of others who utter it mindlessly — perhaps in a state of extreme anger, sudden provocation or inebriation, only to repent later. The clerics insist that a mere utterance of the formula is enough to end a marriage, regardless of the man’s intention or remorse, and demand the couple in question take recourse to the disgraceful practice of halala.
If triple talaq is outlawed, halala will also go, but what about a single divorce pronounced face to face or through a letter, an e-mail, a mobile phone or a WhatsApp message? If this practice, which is much in vogue, is left untouched, will declaring triple talaq unconstitutional make much difference? What is overdue for reform is the law of unilateral divorce, at the man’s pleasure, in its entirety. As regards polygamy, in India, the practice does not mean two or more wives living with their common husband — as was the original concept and is the practice in Arab countries. In India, it means a man throwing out his wife, without divorcing her, and marrying another woman. This distortion of the 7th century Quranic law can make the life of the abandoned wife more miserable than a divorcee.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Be it triple divorce, halala or polygamy, will the judicial verdict be accepted and faithfully followed by all concerned? In 1995, the apex court had outlawed the practice of married non-Muslims indulging in bigamy by sham conversion to Islam. Over a decade later, the deputy chief minister of a state and a law officer of the same state, both under oath to abide by the Constitution and law, resorted to this “device” in order to circumvent the mandate for monogamy under the modern Hindu law. In a TV debate, they claimed that they had done nothing illegal.
In a Law Commission report, written by me in 2008, the government was advised to translate the court verdict into a firm legislative provision incorporated into the Hindu Marriage Act. But this advice went unheeded and the judicially-settled law is still being observed in violations galore.
To spare Muslim wives the ordeal of triple divorce, halala and polygamy, society needs more than sporadic judicial decisions. The personal law system is deep-rooted in society — all citizens are ordinarily governed by one or another community-specific law — and uprooting this system with a single stroke of legislation is neither feasible, nor necessary. Like all other family laws, Muslim law too should be codified and reformed. Strategic revision of existing legislation will be the answer to the problems of the day. There are on the statute book three enactments relating to Muslim family law: Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1937, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939 and Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986. These can be tactfully developed into a Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act. Once adopted by Parliament, ways and means will have to be found for its uncompromising enforcement.
As regards polygamy, Sections 464-65 of the Indian Penal Code dealing with this have remained unchanged for over 150 years. Macaulay had kept its application confined to those whose religious law prohibited polygamy — which, at that time, meant only the Christians. Ninety-five years later, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs were brought into its purview by the Hindu Marriage Act; at present, only the Muslims and all tribal groups remain outside it. Dropping a few words from the IPC provisions can do away with these exceptions.
Family law traditions prevalent among the Muslims of India represent a distorted version of the original Islamic law. Legal reform for them in the true spirit of the Quran is advisable, and quite possible. As a condition precedent for achieving the target — if it is genuinely the target — the issue should be totally depoliticised and de-theologised. Ferocious debates on the idiot box are vitiating the cause and must be stopped. It is a social issue and must be tackled at an apolitical and juridical level.
Social issues as grave as triple talaq cannot be resolved by political rhetoric or trial by media, both of which are being orchestrated in the country. Nor can it be tackled by an utopian scheme like a social boycott of wrong-doers, as the All India Muslim Personal Law Board reportedly decided in Lucknow on Sunday. How effective will be such a boycott and who will have the authority to enforce it? And how will the poor wife, whose life has been ruined, benefit from it?
The argument that triple divorce is bid’at (repugnant to true Islamic law) but it cannot be legally done away with does not stand to reason. The strange formula of “bad in theology but good in law” associated with triple talaq — to which the British Indian courts adhered in the distant past — has no legs to stand on in a modern 21st century society which is, or must be, governed by the principles of law, and not theology.

While releasing Congress’ election manifesto in Lucknow on Wednesday, party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad requested the Election Commission (EC) and the Supreme Court to take note of certain “objectionable” points in the BJP manifesto, “which have been mentioned just to create polarisation”. “BJP ne apne manifesto mein kuch aapattijanak, jo ki election ke dauran nahi rakhni chahiye thi, woh polarisation ke liye rakhain hain..lekin Congress aisa nahi karegi (sic),” he said. Accompanying him were senior leader Sheila Dikshit and state Congress president Raj Babbar, anong others. “We are not going to raise any controversial issue related to any religion. It is our allegation that BJP uses religion during election for polarisation despite a decision by a bench headed by the chief justice,” he added.

Asked to clarify his party’s stand on triple talaq, Azad reiterated that “unlike BJP”, Congress would not speak about any controversial issue now. He admitted that there had been a clash between Congress and SP candidates over some seats because of initial confusion about the alliance. Asked about both Congress and SP candidates contesting on some of the seats, he added: “In between, there was a time when it felt like the alliance had broken down. At that time, the CM announced candidates on about 120 seats. But the alliance was finally formed. However, candidates filed nominations. We are trying to find a solution. At some places, we are withdrawing, they are withdrawing at others.”
Azad said that former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot had been appointed party’s coordinator in state polls."

The year 2016 exactly hasn’t been all that positive side; from political debacles to economic woes, heavy bloodshed and raising hatred, we have rarely found reasons to be happy. And when we did, it rekindled our faith in humanity and made us believe that no matter how dark the night is, the sun will rise.
So, to wrap up the year on a good note here are few stories that will have you happy if not inspired. Stories of young women who dared to break rules, fight stigmas and break stereotypes and hit headlines for all the right reasons. These women decided to tie a knot or not on their own terms and became a voice needed to fight the axiom of ‘weaker sex’. While wedding and marriages are often the things that curtail their freedom and dictates terms, these ladies bent rules or simply resisted in style.

Any wedding is associated with a lot of rituals and customs and of course lavish spendings. But for Kerala’s Sahla Nechiyil, a post graduate in political science from the Hyderabad University, the wedding had to be more meaningful than the customary exchange of goods and golds. Nechiyil decided to demand 50 books from her fiancé as mehr, a mandatory payment in the form of money or possessions paid or promised to be paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage.

Twenty-seven-year-old Sruthi Krishna and Ramnath got married in a quiet and simple manner, at a marriage registration office. At first glance, nothing might seem unusual about the wedding, except that everything was. Gold is not merely worn, it’s portrayed as an emotion in Kerela weddings, she decided not to have even a grain of gold on her. Instead, she wore jewellery made of cereals and grains and looked beautiful. Not just shedding extravagance, she also broke traditions by not wearing a thaali (traditional thread tied by the groom around the bride’s neck). And to make the wedding even more meaningful, as main witness to their marriage they had Sheethal Shyam, a popular LGBTQ activist and transgender in Kerala. Though their actions were more criticised than lauded, they managed to break many stereotypes to the core. Read full story here

The CPI(M) on Monday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “graveyard, cremation ground” remarks, alleging it was a “straightforward” appeal aimed at “communal polarisation” of voters in Uttar Pradesh. “It is a straightforward appeal, an effort for communal polarisation. The talk about kabristan (graveyard) and cremation, Holi and Eid, Diwali and Ramzan…the counter-posing (of these words) itself is an appeal to communal sentiments,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in an interaction with reporters in the capital.

Addressing a poll rally in Fatehpur in UP on Sunday, Modi had stressed that there should be “no discrimination on the basis of caste and religion” and asserted that inclusive growth was his government’s mantra. “Agar kabristan me bijli hai to shamshaan me bhi honi chahiye. Agar Ramzan mein bijli aati hai, to Diwali me bhi aani chahiye, bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye (If there is electricity in the graveyard and during Ramzan, it must also be available in a crematorium and during Diwali. There should be no discrimination),” Modi had said.
Yechury also drew a comparison between Modi and former prime minister and BJP veteran Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He said Vajpayee was “more of a democrat” while Modi was “more of an autocrat”. Yechury alleged that the prime minister was leading BJP’s “fork-tongued” campaign for the UP assembly polls, in which, while Modi was talking about farmers’ debt waivers, other BJP leaders at the same time harped on Ram temple issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“You now have these fork-tongued speeches … there is this one angle of economy and debt waiver and, on the other, straightforward appeal for communal polarisation. The BJP has perfected the tactic,” he alleged. To a question whether such a tactic will backfire on BJP, he said “I hope so.” Targeting Modi further, Yechury observed that Vajpayee, who led the first NDA government between 1998 and 2004, was “very different” from Modi at “various levels”.
Unlike Modi, Vajpayee “never shied away from being accountable to Parliament” and kept the hardcore Hindutva agenda of right wing organisations on the backburner. Under the current regime, the Hindutva agenda of RSS is being reflected at various levels, Yechury said, citing issues like triple talaq, Uniform Civil Code and Article 370. Vajpayee also came in for praise from Yechury for the way he handled the Kashmir issue when he was at the helm of the country’s affairs.
“The slogan of ‘Insaniyat (humanity), Kashmiriyat and Jamhooriyat (democracy)’ Vajpayee gave …even today Kashmiris talk about it,” he said. Accusing the Modi government of not taking confidence building measures, despite announcing so, in Kashmir to tackle the alienation of people there, Yechury expressed apprehension that lack of such steps will lead to Kashmiris losing faith in the government’s commitment towards their welfare. In this context, Yechury said, “Vajpayee in comparison was more of a democrat and Mr Modi in comparison is more of an autocrat.”"

The Janata Dal (U) on Monday criticised any “forced imposition” of a majoritarian view on the religious practices of minorities amid a raging debate over triple talaq. Its spokesperson K C Tyagi said the state should work to bring in the Uniform Civil Code but insisted that it must be based on a broad consensus and not imposed in an authoritarian way.
“Any attempt to impose the Uniform Civil Code without consultation and a consensus, especially on minorities, could lead to social friction and an erosion of faith in the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of religion,” he said in a statement.

Tyagi said JD(U) President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in his letter to the Law Commission has said that his party welcomes any kind of positive changes taking place in the polity and the laws of the country but also expressed concern over any “forced imposition of majoritarian views” on minorities.
His party is of the firm view that any change in the law must come through constructive dialogue among all the stakeholders, Tyagi said.
There should be wide-ranging debates on the issues of triple talaq and the UCC in Parliament as well as legislative assemblies of the states and other forums of the civil society, he said."

“The Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party both loot in their own turns, and when the other comes to power they never take action against the other. SP-BSP-BSP-SP. The power keeps shifting, and in this game, this land never reached its potential. You have faced enough.

Let’s break the cycle of SP-BSP and choose instead to make Uttar Pradesh an “Uttam Pradesh”,” Prime Minister Modi said while addressing a rally in Mahoba, a district in Bundelkhand here.
He said he has requested the citizens to dedicate message and a well wish for all the jawans and security forces this Diwali. Escalating his attack on the Samajwadi Party, the Prime Minister said the farmers in Mahoba have faced grave injustice as this land is capable of reaping gold but farmers got no water.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“Earlier I used to ask people from Bundelkhand in Gujarat if they were from Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh. They all used to say Uttar Pradesh then I stopped asking. Because then I realised that had these people been from Madhya Pradesh they wouldn’t have to come all the way to Gujarat for employment,” he added.
Expressing confidence, Prime Minister Modi said the people would give absolute majority to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Taking a jibe at both the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, the Prime Minister said: “On one side, there are those who want to save their family. On the other side, there are those who just want power. While, we are those who just want to save Uttar Pradesh. This land of Uttar Pradesh is our mother, and we won’t let our mother be looted anymore.”

Money was provided to Bundelkhand for some projects, and yet no work was done here…you will be very sad to hear this.” Stating that Uttar Pradesh has given many Prime Ministers to the nation, Prime Minister Modi said the state has a claim on him as well. “I want to do more work than all those Prime Ministers put together. Modi is not born to rule…he is born to do hard work,” he added.
Prime Minister Modi also said that the issue of triple talaq should not be politicised, adding that proper measures should be taken to give equal rights to women. “I am surprised that for vote bank politics, some parties want to keep Muslim women bereft of their natural rights. I request people who participate in TV debates don’t make women rights into Muslim Hindu issue. Women’s right is a development issue. People from Uttar Pradesh will wait for Uttar Pradesh this time, Delhi knows that Uttar Pradesh has decided this,” he added."

Accusing the Narendra Modi government of hurting the religious sentiments of minority community, the Barelvi sect of Muslims Saturday announced to hold a massive protest and signature campaign against the “uniform civil code” and in favour of “triple talaq”.
A decision to this effect was taken at Dargah Aala Hazrat in Bareilly on Friday.
Talking to The Sunday Express, Dargah’s spokesperson Salim Noori said that the clerics have decided to protest against the central government for hurting religious sentiments of Muslims by promoting uniform civil code and infringing on personal laws and rights of minorities under the Constitution.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Is samay Hindustan me Musalmano ko Modi huqumat ne bahut mushkil me dal dia hai. Supreme Court me Muslim personal law ke khilaf halafnama dakhil karke common civil code ka raasta saaf kia ja raha hai jo mulq ke zamhoori dhaanche ko khatm karke desh ko Hindu Rashtra banane ki taiyari hai. Hairat to is bat ki hai ke secular kehlane wali siyasi partian is masle par khamosh tamashai bani hui hain. (Modi government has created a huge problem for the Muslims. By filing an affidavit against the Muslim Personal Law in the Supreme Court, the government has cleared the way for implementing the uniform civil code and creating a Hindu nation. What’s more surprising is the fact that the political parties, which claim to be secular, are silent on the issue),” alleged Noori.
He further said that the clerics at the Dargah have threatened to hold the kind of protest “which was held during the Indira Gandhi regime”against forced family planning.
“BJP is trying to reap political benefits by raising the Muslim Personal Law is. This is highly condemnable,” Noori added.
Former Sajjadanasheen of the Dargah, Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan said, “As per the Quran and Hadis, triple talaq is right in principle but according to Islam, pronouncing talaq thrice in one breath is not considered as good and Shariat courts give verdict on these issues in this light”.
Triple talaq, he claimed, is followed by Muslim community across India and will remain so. “If the central government is going to file affidavit related to triple talaq in the court, it will be considered as direct interference in Shariat. We will not tolerate this,” he added.
The ulemas who took part in Friday’s meeting alleged that Muslim women were being “instigated against Islam” and the real aim of such people was to create internal differences on sensitive issues so as to end the Muslim personal law."

In an apparent damage control, BJP on Sunday clarified it had not denied tickets to Muslim candidates in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls “owing to their religion”, while asserting that the mention of “triple talaq” in party manifesto underscored its “commitment to welfare of minority women”. Addressing a joint press conference here, party national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh and official spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain, defended the party’s position in safeguarding the interests of minorities in the poll-bound state.

“If a large number of people flee their homes out of fear, it must be a cause for concern for any responsible political party. Let us not view this problem through the prism of religious affiliations,” he said referring to mass migration of Hindus from Muslim-dominated town of Kairana in the state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain had kicked up a row on Saturday by stating that the party had not fielded any Muslim candidate in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections as it did not find winnable candidates from the community.
“BJP has not given tickets to Muslim candidates from any of the assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh as the party could not find even a single candidate who could ensure a win,” he had told reporters at Kota in Rajasthan.
He had also said that ticket distribution on the basis of caste during elections was “obligatory”.
“When reservation can be given on the basis of caste, why can’t the party tickets be distributed on the basis of caste?” he asked.
Hussain along with Singh, however, said at the joint press conference that the distribution of party tickets by BJP was solely based on merit.
“We do not believe in discriminating against people in the name of religion. That is the reason why we have been opposed to giving reservation in jobs on religious grounds. Our party believes in working for betterment of all. We have demonstrated this approach in all the states where we are in power as well as at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“On the other hand, practitioners of the brand of politics, which makes an issue out of giving tickets to Muslims ought to be held accountable for their plight. We have given tickets only on merit,” the leaders said.
On being asked about the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, the BJP leaders said, “We have only reiterated our commitment to the issue. Construction of temple through the legislative route would require legislation both at the Centre and state levels.”
The BJP has so far announced its candidates for 370 out of 403 assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh, where voting will be held in seven phases beginning next month.
There have been speculations that the reported move of BJP to not give tickets to any Muslim candidate in the state, where the minority community has a sizeable presence, could be a subtle way of playing the Hindutva card.
BJP is hoping to make a comeback in the state, where it has been relegated to the position of a marginal player for nearly a decade. This is in contrast with the 1990s, where the saffron party was a major player, riding the wave triggered by the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.
The party’s hopes of revival in the politically crucial state were bolstered in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when it put up a stunning performance, winning 71 out of the 78 seats it had contested. The BJP leaders also spoke at length on the party’s vision for the development of Uttar Pradesh as elucidated in the party manifesto released yesterday by party chief Amit Shah.
They also claimed that “a wave in favour of our party is sweeping across the state and it has forced sworn enemies like Congress and Samajwadi Party into a tight embrace.”
Terming the Congress-SP tie-up for the state Assembly polls a “sangam (confluence) of lawlessness and corruption”, Hussain and Singh also ridiculed the coalition’s catch line “UP ko ye saath pasand hai (UP likes this alliance)” launched by Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav earlier in the day.
“The slogan launched by Congress vice-president and UP Chief Minister sounds like an obvious parody of a Bollywood song. Such gimmicks would, however, not succeed in these two parties’ attempts at brushing aside their failures, while in power at the Centre and in the state, under the carpet,” they added."

US Court denies Donald Trump request to immediately restore travel ban
A federal appeals court denied early Sunday the Justice Department’s request for an immediate reinstatement of President Donald Trump’s ban on accepting certain travelers and all refugees. The Trump administration appealed a temporary order restraining the ban nationwide, saying late Saturday night that the federal judge in Seattle overreached by “second-guessing” the president on a matter of national security. Now the higher court’s denial of an immediate stay means the legal battles over the ban will continue for days at least. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco asked challengers of the ban respond to the appeal, and for the Justice Department to file a counter-response by Monday afternoon. Read more"

The Bombay High Court’s verdict upholding the constitutional right of women to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the iconic Haji Ali dargah in Worli could serve as a “get real” signal to the custodians of Indian Islam. Sadly, that is not to be. The theological matrices within which the Indian ulema are trained and constrained to function, render them ill-equipped to co-relate Islam with universally accepted modern-day principles of secular governance and equal citizenship rights. Given this, the ulema are incapable of reading the writing on the wall.
But educated Muslim women such as those leading the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) are today doing their own reading to discover that, contrary to the claims of the male-centred clerics, the core values enshrined in the Quran are in consonance with the egalitarian, gender-just principles of the Indian Constitution. So, they are turning to the courts, which are restoring to Muslim women their Quran-given and constitutionally-guaranteed rights that the ulema continue to deny. The Bombay HC’s verdict has opened the floodgates and there is no turning back the tide.
Of the many reasons cited by the Haji Ali Dargah Trust in support of its 2011-12 decision to bar women from getting close to the Sufi saint’s mazaar, the core issue before the court was the trustees’ case that restricting entry of women to the sanctum sanctorum of the dargah is “an essential and integral part of Islam” and was therefore entitled to protection under Article 25 (Right to freedom of religion) and Article 26(b) (Freedom of every religious denomination or any section thereof to manage its own affairs in matters of religion).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Bombay HC relied on several rulings of the Supreme Court, which may be summed up in the verdict of the seven-judge bench in the Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Math case: “What constitutes the essential part of a religion has to be determined with reference to its doctrines, practices, tenets, historical background etc. Essential part of a religion means the core beliefs upon which a religion is founded. Essential practice means those practices that are fundamental to follow a religious belief. [The] test to determine whether a part or practice is essential to the religion is to find out whether the nature of religion will change without that part or practice. It is such essential parts [that are] protected by the Constitution”.
In the light of the SC’s rulings, the Bombay HC observed that in the Haji Ali case reference must be made to the Quran, “the fundamental Islamic text”, to determine whether the recently enforced practice is “essential to Islam”. It noted that the Quranic verses cited by the trustees “do not in any way show that Islam does not permit entry of women at all, in dargahs/mosques”. Not only did the trustees fail the “essential practices” test, by their own admission, women were allowed entry into the sanctum sanctorum until a few years ago.
Concluding that “Article 26 cannot be seen to abridge or abrogate the right given under Article 25 of the Constitution” the HC court ruled: “We hold that the ban imposed by the Trust, prohibiting women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the Haji Ali dargah contravenes Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution and as such restore status quo ante, that is, women be permitted to enter the sanctum sanctorum, on par with men”. Some legal experts maintain that the essentiality criterion is a slippery slope. The judiciary should avoid getting embroiled in the business of what is essential and what is not and simply affirm that the freedom of religion is subservient to other fundamental rights.
What next? The HC order already hints at Muslim women’s right to pray in mosques; yet another example of an Islam-given right denied by the ulema. Several petitions by Muslim women are currently pending in the SC, praying for an end to triple talaq, halala marriage (divorced Muslim women must marry another man, engage in sexual intercourse and divorce him before she can remarry her former husband) and polygamy. Who is going to convince the SC, and how, that these practices are “an integral and essential part of Islam” and that a ban on such practices will “change the very nature of Islam”? Muslim women now know their Quran and the Constitution.

"1617716949-13","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Bangla order on talaq spurs demand to codify personal law","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/bangla-order-on-talaq-spurs-demand-to-codify-personal-law/","Bangla order on talaq spurs demand to codify personal law","February 4, 2001","NEW DELHI, FEB 3: A judgement of the Bangladeshi High Court declaring triple talaq as invalid has raised demands among Muslims here for codification of the Muslim personal law in the country.
The law is yet to be codified in India and Bangladesh. Syed Shahabuddin, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board executive, says that the differences over various issues underline the need to codify the personal law.
Shahabuddin said that the initiative has to come from the Muslim community. He adds that he has been writing on the need to codify personal law. “But my voice is a voice in the wilderness,” he says.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shahnawaz Hussain also supports the demand but passes the buck onto Shahabuddin, saying that the initiative has to come from the Muslim Personal Law Board.
Last month, a division bench of the Dhaka High Court had annulled a fatwa given by a moulvi and ordered his arrest. Moulvi Azizul Islam had given a fatwa that the marriage of a woman Shahida with her husband Saifulla was dissolved after the latter gave triple talaq in one sitting. He had then compelled Shahida to marry her husband’s paternal cousin.
The judgement declared both the fatwa and the triple talaq in one sitting as invalid creating ripples in socio-religious circles there. For, triple talaq in a single sitting had been upheld in judgments in India and Bangladesh based on the available interpretations of the Muslim Personal Law.
Justices Rabbani and Sultana of the division bench of the Dhaka High Court said in their judgment that they had arrived at the decision on the basis of their own interpretation of the personal law as they found it in Quran.
Supreme Court advocate Anees Ahmed said decisions on talaq and fatwa have been based on earlier judgments made by British privy councils in pre-independent India which are, in turn, based on interpretations of personal law made by British commentators.
Ahmad says that according to the Quran, talaq can be given only in three sittings with an interval of one month between two sittings. This has not been the case in India where triple talaq, said even in the state of intoxication, is recognised as valid.
“The Bangla judges were able to arrive at such a judgment because they chose to look at the personal law not through the commentaries on it but at its very source, viz., the Quran, from where it is derived. This is something we want in India. We need to codify the personal law for we still read it through the eyes of British interpretations,” says Ahmed who is also a member of NGO Muslim Women’s Forum.
Shahabuddin points out that the absence of a codified perrsonal law is glaring. “The core law on the personal law, the Shariat Application Act of 1937, says that the Muslim personal law will apply on Muslims. But till date, no one has spelt out what the Muslim personal law is,” he said.
“A hundred people say a hunderd different things about what the personal law is. Unless it is codified, this ambiguity will continue,” says Ahmed."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that the Muslim community must not politicise the issue of triple talaq and rather look for solutions. Speaking at the Basava Convention in New Delhi, Prime Minister Modi said: “Main Muslim samaaj se aagrah karunga ki triple talaq ke mudde ko rajneeti ke daayre mein mat aane dijiye. Aap log aake aakar iska samaadhan kijiye (I request Muslim society not to politicise the triple talaq issue. Rather, come forward and solve the matter).”
Prime Minister Modi called upon the reformers of the community to fight against the suffering of Muslim daughters in the country and hoped on finding a solution on the issue. “Muslim samaaj se prabudh log aage aayenge, Muslim betiyon ke saath jo guzar rahi hai uske khilaf woh khud ladai ladenge aur kabhi na kabhi raasta nikalenge (Muslim reformers will come forward some day and fight against the suffering of Muslim daughters to find a way forward),” he was quoted as saying by ANI.
Modi said he hoped that “powerful people” would emerge from society and help “eradicate outdated practices and evolve modern systems”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He called upon Indian Muslims to lead not just those from the community in the country, but to show the “path of modernity” to Muslims worldwide. “That is the kind of power and energy this land gives to all of us,” he said to thunderous applause. The prime minister spoke about women’s empowerment, equality and good governance, as preached and practised by Basaveswara.

PM Modi had earlier spoken on the triple talaq issue in April at the BJP National Executive Meet in Bhubaneswar. Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had said that the Prime Minister talked about Muslim women getting justice. “He (Modi) talked about social justice. He said our Muslim sisters should also get justice. Injustice should not be done with them. Nobody should be exploited. We do not want that there is conflict within the Muslim community over this issue. What we have to do is that if there are any social evils, we have to wake up the society and make efforts to provide justice to them (Muslim women). That was the Prime Minister’s spirit,” Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said while briefing reporters.
At the event, Prime Minister Modi unveiled translated volumes of Vachana, penned by 12th-century social reformer Basavanna and other saints in 23 Indian languages. Today is Basavanna’s birth anniversary."

RSS state secretary Jishnu Basu on Thursday said he agreed with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s views on terrorism, but remarked that she needed to introspect and opt for self-reform in her own government.

“Mamata Banerjee had recently tweeted that communal terrorism was one of the worst forms of terrorism. I could not agree more with her, but she needs to tell that to some of her Cabinet ministers and senior party leaders. One of her ministers calls his constituency ‘mini-Pakistan’, another has been speaking for an accused in the Khagragarh blast case and a Rajya Sabha MP had been helping fundamentalists in the state,” Basu told mediapersons.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that during the last RSS national executive committee meeting on October 22 in Hyderabad, members said there was an alarming rise of jihadi activities in Bengal, along with an increase in cases of atrocities against Hindus. “Post the meeting, a statement said Bengal has become a safe haven for Muslim fundamentalist groups. Bengal got a special mention in the meeting after this government came to power,” Basu added.
On October 25, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Roopa Ganguly, after returning from a visit to Bangladesh, had said Hindu minorities there were living a better life now. Negating that, Basu said, “I think she doesn’t have enough information about the living conditions of Hindus in Bangladesh, in totality, when she made those comments. Ground reality is different from what she thought. Hindu minorities have been subjected to attacks by fundamental religious groups.” He added he would apprise her of the situation in Bangladesh.
On triple talaq, Basu said the RSS would cooperate with individuals or organisations working for equal rights for men and women. “If some Muslim women organisation seeks help for victims of atrocities, we will help them,” he added.
The RSS claimed its branches and members have increased significantly during the TMC regime. “There has been an increase of about 275 new branches last year. At present, there are about 1,450 branches at 800 locations,” said RSS spokesperson Bidyut Mukherjee. The branches have come up in South-24 Parganas, North-24 Parganas, Midnapore and Birbhum.
On CPM and Congress hinting at an understanding between TMC and communal forces, and attributing this to increasing number of RSS branches, Basu said: “People are now seeing politics of appeasement and that is why there has been a rising number of branches and members of RSS.”"

BJP’s Kerala unit President Kummanom Rajasekharan today said his party has not insulted noted writer M T Vasudevan Nair for his comments over the impact of demonetisation, maintaining that everyone had the freedom to air one’s opinion. Reacting to the controversy triggered after party General Secretary A N Radhakrishnan questioned the motive and expertise of the Jnanpith award winning writer to speak on the issue, Rajasekharan said the writer stated his views on the matter and similarly party leaders responded with their opinion.

“It is not an insult.It is airing of one’s opinion. Everyone has the freedom for that. Many persons have expressed opinion in favour and against on note ban,” he said.
He said no one should forget the criticism by State Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac against actor Mohanlal when he commented in favour of note ban. “Differences of opinion is natural, it has to be seen like that only,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, Radhakrishnan said a writer is not a person beyond criticism.
“I respect and regard Vasudevan Nair as an author.But I stand by my criticism against Nair’s political views on note issue and will continue to do that.I have not insulted Vasudevan Nair personally,” he added.
The BJP in the state has come under attack for its remarks against the writer with LDF describing it as fascist.
Besides questioning the motive of Nair’s comment, Radhakrishnan had also said the writer ‘kept mum’ when CPI(M) dissident leader T P Chandrasekharan was hacked to death and when ‘triple talaq’ was a raging issue.
Nair commented on demonetisation during the release of a book authored by Isaac at a function at Tirur in Malappuram district on December 27."
"1617717110-57","https://indianexpress.com/page/121/?s=Triple+talaq","Muslim women get own Jamaat, want mosque","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/muslim-women-get-own-jamaat-want-mosque/","Muslim women get own Jamaat, want mosque","September 12, 2005","It began as a regular statement against gender bias. But development organisation STEPS, now made up of some 8,000 determined Muslim women spread across Tamil Nadu’s southern districts, is rewriting history.
While a national debate raged about a common nikahnama and triple talaq, Pudukottai’s Muslim women quietly established the first all-women Jamaat in the world. Now, in the town’s orthodox backyard, a mosque will rise where these women can pray.

Of course there was bound to be opposition. When the all-women Jamaat first raised their voice in unison for a mosque for themselves last year, the local Jamaat offered a piece of land at Parambu village in Pudukottai district.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The mosque was to be a ‘‘real one’’ with minarets and even a woman moulvi well-versed in the Koran and the Islamic tenets. But after fierce protests from Pudukottai’s conservative Muslims, the local Jamaat hastily withdrew its offer.

Now the members of STEPS are secretive about their plans for the mosque. ‘‘We are determined that a mosque will come up soon. But, we don’t want to say anything more about it,’’ said founder Daud Sharifa Khanam.

The movement demanding rights for Muslim women began rather diffidently about 15 years ago. In Manapparai, in the neighbouring Tiruchirapalli district, Sharifa was the tenth child in a Muslim family. As a young girl, with a rebellious streak and wild imagination—‘‘I would even dream about wearing a necklace of burning coals around my neck’’—Sharifa opposed tradition and refused to wear the burkha. She questioned the inequities of the Shariat laws and dreamt of a world where women and men lived ‘‘the way they should’’.



 

How they got justice               
               for themselves








 

 • All-women Jamaat gives Muslim women               a forum for resolving disputes without bias 
               • More than 15 petitions relating to               nikah disputes are received by the Jamaat 
               • The women now want their own mosque               though conservatives are opposing it 

 








‘‘I never thought I could make it a reality,’’ Sharifa (40) said, relaxing in the STEPS office, housed in a small bungalow, which she began in 1991. The place is ‘‘a platform for protest and relief’’ for battered Muslim women and victims of the ‘triple talaq’ and dowry harassment. In fact, each of STEPS’ bricks, now covered with a shabby coat of paint, has a story to tell. Defying the diktats of their society and the powerful and influential maulvis, the STEPS women have taken the bold step of stepping out of their homes  and  fighting for their rights.

Initially, it was just a trickle. ‘‘The men would abuse me and intimidate the women from approaching me for help,’’ said Sharifa, a post-graduate in history and office management from Aligarh University. But now, more than 15 petitions relating to mostly to nikah disputes flow in every day, amazingly many directed to STEPS by the other Jamaats. The cases are tossed over to the 35-member Tamil Nadu Muslim Women’s Jamaat Committee for solutions. In the last one year, the committee has solved 55 cases.



Every time a petitioner knocks on the STEPS doors, the case is perused by the committee members and taken up for discussion at the monthly sittings. At these sittings, which take place in a different district, both the men and women involved take part in the debate, mediations or negotiations.

‘‘This is so unlike what happens in the other chauvinistic all-male, one-sided Jamaats. The women can never present their side. Decisions are taken based on the man’s version alone and talaq is pronounced without hearing what the woman has to say in her defence,’’ pointed out Sharifa.

For instance, Sajjida Banu (23) of Pudukottai was not only tortured by her in-laws for more dowry but also abandoned by her husband. The local Jamaat refused to sympathise. ‘‘Sajjida finally came to us. We got her husband jailed and we are also trying for a decent settlement for her,’’ said Sharifa. Sajjida is now an active Jamaat member.

Initially, before the all-woman Jamaat put on its battlegear, it went around pleading with the all-male Jamaats to be reasonable and fair while settling disputes. Soon, it decided to take matters in to its own hands. The Jamaat Committee aimed to ensure human rights, social empowerment and improved standards of living for Muslim women. If the men or their relatives refused to heed to its decisions, it threatened to take the cases before the police.In the case of one Fowsia Banu (21), the Jamaat got her out of a marriage to a deaf, dumb and allegedly impotent man.

But the Jamat’s success has been in drawing complaints from men as well as women. In fact, Labbaikudikadu village in Perambalur district was so swayed by the all-woman Jamaat’s reasonableness in handling issues that village leaders agreed to conduct marriages without accepting dowry. ‘‘The women were so harassed they only needed a spark. That is all that I provided—and a space. The suggestion for an all-woman Jamaat came from them,’’ said Sharifa."

Defending the Centre’s opposition on the triple talaq system, Union Electronic and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday asserted that in a secular nation like India, women cannot be allowed to suffer under such an arbitrary and derogatory system. Listing out the Centre’s three-fold stand which was given in response to the Supreme Court over certain petitions filed by Muslim women, Prasad told ANI that firstly, the issue concerns only and only about the dignity, non-discrimination of women, respect to them and gender justice and India being a secular country governed by a constitution, the abiding values of its constitution about gender justice, dignity of women needs to be respected.

“The second is, India is a secular country. Secularism is a basic structure of the Constitution. Can we, where we have got a secular India, allow the women to suffer a kind of a system which is derogatory and arbitrary?” he said. Illuminating the third point, the Union Minister mentioned that in more than a dozen Islamic countries ranging from Bangladesh to Syria and even Pakistan, matrimonial laws have been regulated by law including triple talaq.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If in acknowledged Islamic countries, change of matrimonial laws is not found to be violating Sharia, how can such a plea be raised in a secular country like India?,” he said. On Friday, the Centre filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Triple Talaq and polygamy validity. According to the affidavit, the Centre said that there is no reason women in India should be denied their constitutional rights.
“Validity of Triple Talaq and polygamy have to be seen in light of gender justice, equality and dignity of women,” stated the Centre in its affidavit. The Government also said that polygamy and triple talaq do not adhere to constitutional values and, therefore, cannot be accepted. The Muslim law board had earlier claimed that triple talaq is a ‘personal law’ and, hence, cannot be modified by the Centre."

Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday asserted that religion cannot dictate upon the rights of an individual and attacked Congress over its stand on the Uniform Civil Code, saying it was the Constituent Assembly controlled by the party that had envisaged a common civil law for all Indians.

“Personal law cannot practise, propagate discrimination; cannot allow a compromise with human dignity. Personal law and practises can certainly deal with religion, can dictate upon rituals. The religion cannot dictate upon rights of individuals,” the Finance Minister said.
The government’s affidavit on triple talaq is a secular approach, an approach that cuts upon religion, he said.

He rejected the criticism of the government by various Muslim bodies, saying personal laws have been amended by the various governments and cited the amendment brought in by the first NDA government in divorce laws governing Christians. The Church fully supported it, he said.
The Manmohan Singh government had also brought changes in Hindu Succession Act to bring the woman at par with the man in inheritance, Jaitley told Times Now.
Taking a dig at Congress, he said he was “amazed” at its stand as he recalled that the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, who belonged to the party, had envisaged an Uniform Civil Code.

The party rode to power on the strength of Muslim blood and tears.
It is shocking that most Gujarati Hindus have agreed with the Modi-Togadia line of hatred for Muslims. The entire BJP campaign was based on rejecting Muslims as terrorists and Pakistanis.

Five million Gujarati Muslims have practically been marginalised. Ours is a poor community with a high rate of illiteracy. But adversity will make us stronger in the days to come. Muslims are not going to leave Gujarat. Nor will we live as second class-citizens on the charity of the Sangh Parivar.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Just as Hindus remember Somnath and Mohammed of Ghazni, Muslims will always remember Gujarat and Modi. We will never forget this pogrom and we will never allow another pogrom.

Muslims will have to change their very way of life to adjust to the emerging crisis. No words are too strong to condemn the fatwa issued on the eve of the elections. Ulema have no business to dabble in politics. They must go back to their mosques and only preach the Koran and the Shariat.

Socio-economic transformation is a must if the community is to avoid becoming the new untouchables of India. Each and every Muslim boy and girl must get the best and highest education possible. Our future lies as a business community. The ideal example is that of the Jews in America.

We must know that this means women have to be treated with maximum respect and dignity. Triple talaq must be treated as un-Islamic. The whole foundation of Muslim society should rest on our women, who must model themselves on the lines of Hazrat Khadija and Hazrat Fatima.

While Muslims will always treat BJP as poison, we must be equally wary of all political parties that are aligned with it. For, by their silence, they made it possible for the Gujarat experiment to take place.

Our current worry is a communal polarisation being deliberately provoked in other states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The only remedy lies in eternal vigilance.

The Congress’s stance on secularism is quite weak. They appear embarrassed to mention the name of Gandhi and Nehru. Soft Hindutva is not the answer to hard Hindutva, but I must mention that Sonia Gandhi has her heart in the right place on the secular issue. A greater assertiveness by her will help  the country.

I strongly disfavour the Mulayam Singh Yadav brand of secularism. It has become identified with the five-star culture of Amar Singh. This is making a mockery of a very grave national issue.

Islam teaches that Allah is Rab-ul-Aalmin, he is the creator of everyone and everything.

In that sense, all Hindus are our brothers and we must never hate them. Muslims will always be indebted to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, who sacrificed his life so that we could live in India as equal citizens with respect and dignity.

We appeal to all people of goodwill and conscience in India and abroad to recognise that the Sangh Parivar is no different from the Taliban of Afghanistan. Please stand with us in this fight between Good and Evil.

Professor J.K. Bandukwala teaches Nuclear Physics at M.S. University. During the Gujarat riots, he was saved from a mob by his Hindu neighbours. But the next day, a bigger mob torched his house and car. Bandukwala then fled to Mumbai, spent time abroad and returned to Vadodara after a few months."

Amid a raging debate over triple talaq and a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about addressing the concerns of Muslim women, the Congress said on Monday that if any religious practice is “contrary to modern times”, the effort should be to end it, with the consent of the community and by taking all the stakeholders into confidence. While the party said it supports gender justice and women’s rights, it did not speak out against the practice of triple talaq. It only said that an atmosphere of trust and confidence needs to be built for changing the personal law of any community.
“Congress stands for gender justice. We stand strongly and fully for Muslim women also… The Supreme Court is actively seized with the matter. The matter is sub-judice. Everybody, opponents or proponents, have displayed clear unequivocal intent to abide by the SC verdict. There is no reason to muddy the waters before that verdict. There is no reason to preempt it, influence it, overpower it, sensationalise it before the verdict,” said party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi.
Stating that the party has been at the forefront of reforms, he referred to the Hindu code Bill enacted by the Jawaharlal Nehru government in the 1950s and right to inheritance law enacted by the UPA government. He said several Muslim bodies have said the manner and practice of the “offending part of triple talaq” is contrary to Sharia and Quran.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“What more I can say, what more I should say. They have shut their ears because they want to play politics with it,” Singhvi said, reacting to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s remarks that those maintaining silence on the “burning issue” of triple talaq are as “guilty” as those practising it.
Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala said the BJP is using the issue to divide society. “Whatever be the personal religious practices of any religion, there is a need to sit together to try and imbibe them in the modern times. An atmosphere should be created first. If any religious practice is contrary to modern times, then effort should be made to eliminate it with their (the community’s) consent. All stakeholders must be taken into confidence,” he said."

Narendra Modi’s pitch against ‘triple talaq’ has added fuel to the contentious debate on the Muslim divorce practice, with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today saying those silent on the issue were as “guilty” as the ones practising it.

The All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) asked the Uttar Pradesh government to draft a strict law against triple talaq, similar to the one which banned the practice of sati, to prevent Muslim women from getting victimised.
The Hindu far right also reacted angrily to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s (AIMPLB) assertion that Muslims have a constitutional right to follow their personal laws of which ‘triple talaq’ was a part, contending the Sunni outfit was responsible for “all problems” faced by the community.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While deprecating any outside meddling with the Muslim personal law, the AIMPLB had said it would issue a code of conduct under which those pronouncing ‘triple talaq’ without valid reasons mentioned under ‘Sharia’ (Islamic law) will face social boycott.
Adityanath, known for his hardline Hindutva image, questioned the “silence” of the political class on the “burning issue” of triple talaq.
Drawing an analogy between the silence of politicians on triple talaq and that of the nobles during the disrobing of ‘Draupadi’ in the Mahabharata, he said in Lucknow, “Those in the political class that are keeping mum need to be put in the dock along with the perpetrators of the crime and their accomplices.”
Reacting sharply, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) termed Adityanath’s remark as “jaahilaanaa” (foolish).
“These days, there is a new debate in the country on a burning issue. Some people are maintaining silence on this issue. This reminds me of the scene in the Mahabharata in which Draupadi is being disrobed and she asks a question to the gathering as to who is responsible for this incident, this sin?” Adityanath said.
“No one uttered even a single word. Only Vidur said people who have committed the crime, the accomplices and those who maintained silence on this issue are equally responsible,” he said, referring to the practice of triple talaq.
Adityanath made these remarks at an event to mark the 91st birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar.
Calling for an end to the Muslim practice of triple talaq the Chief Minister also advocated a uniform civil code in the country.
His remarks came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch against the divisive issue of triple talaq, insisting that exploitation of Muslim women should end and justice be done to them.
Modi had, however, spoken against any attempt at creating a “conflict” within the Muslim community on the issue and suggested tackling it through social awareness.
On Adityanath’s statement, AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani said, “I don’t know how to react to the jaahilaanaa (foolish) statement. He is linking talaq with a greater issue — the disrobing of Draupadi. No sane person will do so. He is looking at things using a different lens (doosraa chashmaa).”
Meanwhile, the All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) spokesman Maulana Yasoob Abbas said merely boycotting those guilty of pronouncing talaq without reasons mentioned under the Sharia will not amount to doing justice to the aggrieved woman. The Shias among Muslims do not practise triple talaq.
Abbas drew a parallel between pronouncing triple talaq in one go and the sati, the banned Hindu practice of the wife immolating herself on the dead husband’s funeral pyre.
“The need of the hour is to enact a strict law against triple talaq in one go that is similar to the anti-sati law to prevent any Muslim woman from getting victimised and ensure that the culprit is punished,” he told PTI in Lucknow.
“Triple talaq is wrong as also is the tendency to remain silent on this issue. Giving triple talaq in one go to a woman is a sin, but it cannot be equated to disrobing (of Draupadi),” he said, referring to Adityanath’s analogy.
With the hugely divisive issue being hotly debated, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad attacked the AIMPLB on triple talaq, saying the Islamic body was not ready to give equal rights to women, whom they treat as an “object”.
“AIMPLB is responsible for all problems faced by Muslims. They still assume women as objects and are not ready to give them basic fundamental right of equality.
“Muslim women should have equal rights in cases of talaq at par with men,” Jain said in a statement in New Delhi, asking the Modi government to bring a law guaranteeing equal rights to Muslim women."

President of the Muslim Women’s Law Board Shaista Ambar told The Indian Express that their nikahnama would have legal safeguards for Muslim women in the light of Quran and shariat.

Ambar said she would also seek the sanction of the Supreme Court in making divorce difficult. ‘‘Aaj kal nikah mushkil ho gaya hai, aur talaq lena aasan (It is difficult to marry these days but easy to get a divorce),’’ she said.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Describing the model nikahnama as a ‘‘dua ki kitab (prayer book)’’, Ambar said the AIMPLB has just completed a formality and the new draft was just a jugglery of phrases. ‘‘The rights of women have not been elaborated in the model nikahnama,’’ she said.

When contacted, AIMPLB vice-chairman Maulana Kalbe Sadiq said the focal point of Islam was justice and fairplay and denied that injustice has been done to Muslim women. Moreover, the Maulana said the model nikahnama was just a draft and not obligatory on the Muslims.

The legal convenor of the law board, Zafaryab Jilani, said the model was an important document which contained several checks and balances in a bid to discourage triple talaq.

Burqa controversy in Bengal school

BERHAMPORE: A controversy has erupted over a high school teacher, a recent convert to Islam, wearing a burqa over her attire in protest against the school authorities insistence on her wearing a sari like her colleagues.

Sushmita Mondal, now Sumaiya Parveen, a teacher of Anandamani Girls’ High School at Amtala in Murshidabad district had refused to abide by the school authorities direction that she wear sari as per the school tradition.

Parveen, a masters degree holder in English who embraced Islam after her marriage to a Muslim teacher, is understood to have worn some dress other than the sari to the school to which the authorities did not agree. Then as a mark of protest she wore sari but chose to cover it with burqa.

The school officials said today that a meeting has been called to discuss the issue. “We have only asked her to wear saris as other teachers do.” School Education Minister Kanti Biswas said in Kolkata that he had heard of the controversy, but the state government would not interfere. “The government expects teachers to dress with taste and decency. But we can’t make a rule as in the present case,” Biswas said. 	—PTI"

(File)
Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday questioned the silence of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad on the Allahabad High Court’s observation that “triple talaq is cruelty against Muslim women”. He also said that his party is on board with the court’s observations. “It is baffling that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad have chosen to maintain stoic silence on the raging issue of triple talaq for the sake of vote bank politics,” Sushil Modi alleged.
Watch what else is making news: 
Asking Kumar if he had taken consent of the male population before granting 50 percent reservation to women in the state’s panchayats, he said if not, why wasn’t he supporting Muslim women in their crusade against the menace which was opposed by 90 percent of them.

Claiming inconsistency in the chief minister’s stand on empowerment of women, the BJP leader accused him of not backing Muslim women in their fight against triple talaq and polygamy for the sake of vote bank politics.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He claimed this amounted to leaving the fate of women in the hands of hardliners of the minority community. Modi also reminded Kumar that he had imposed prohibitionin the state on the demand of women at a function last year. “If you can impose prohibition in Bihar on the call of a few women, why don’t you muster courage to oppose triple talaq?” he said. Reformist measures were not implemented after taking consent of those opposing it and if it was so, the practise of ‘Sati’ would not have been done away with, he added.
Stating that the Allahabad High Court has observed that Muslim Personal Law was not above right to equality and fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, Modi asked the ruling grand alliance leaders to clarify their stand on triple talaq."

Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Friday called the decades-old practice of keeping personal laws separate from constitutional rights as a “surprising opinion” and expressed hope of a judicial review soon of laws that do not conform to constitutional rights. Jaitley said 2017 will be “extremely different” on the issue of personal laws.
“In the 1950s, if one sees the public discourse, when the Hindu law was amended…we could see there were two opinions in society as to how you can enforce the very idea of equality as far as law is concerned, and law always is the first step because then to execute and implement it, it takes years and sometimes generations,” the Finance Minister said.
He said “a very surprising judicial opinion” at that time was that “while all laws must confine to the constitutional rights itself, personal laws need not. Because they are not laws for that purpose, so they were excluded”. Jaitley was speaking at the launch of the Gender Parity Index by the FICCI Ladies Organisation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His comments came days after the Central government told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that the practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy impact the social status and dignity of Muslim women and deny them fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
On the issue of gender inequality, the minister said although the country is willing to change, lags still exist. “When you speak in terms of (gender) parity, conceptually, we provided for parity (in the Constitution). We also provided for some affirmative action in order to improve upon an endeavour to reach that level of equality. But there were always challenges,” he said.
He said that in a society conventionally loaded against parity and equality, there has been “a conscious attempt to cover up the lags, which we must honestly confess still exist”."

Not only does it recognise the right of women to seek divorce (khula) and separation, it ensures financial settlement with an eye to the welfare of the woman and her children, advises registration of marriages and forbids forceful marriages.
The new code also rejects talaq through SMS, e-mail, phone and video conferencing. Talaq on provocation will not be considered either. According to it, talaq to be valid should be spread over three months to give the couple ample time to reconsider the issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are not scared of the mullah, but the Allah,” said Shaista Amber, chairperson of the AIMWPLB. “The mullahs will never come to the rescue of destitute women. Why should the Muslim woman be scared to seek khula when this right has been provided to her by the Allah?”
The new Nikahnama has a 17-point Hidayatnama (guidlines for marriage under the Shariat law for bride and groom) and an 8-point section on the process of talaq. The Hidayatnama declares that any forceful nikah is not acceptable. Forceful dowry has also been forbidden.
Amber said the new “Shariat Nikahnama” was very different from the model Nikahnama of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).
“The model Nikahnama had not taken care of the women’s rights as per the Koran. The new Nikahnama maintains the equilibrium,” she said.
While the model Nikahnama is in Urdu, Shariat Nikahnama is available both in Hindi and Urdu so it reaches more people.
“The woman has full authority to seek khula under Shariat law, from her husband if the husband harasses her and her children,” said Amber. 
The woman must approach the Darul Kaza (a Shariat court) for seeking divorce under khula. In case of talaq, all gifts received during the marriage and afterwards will be the property of the bride. 
In absence of a divorce, the Nikahnama says any woman can go for separation if the husband is missing for four years, has an illicit relationship with another woman or refused to disclose HIV status before or after marriage. Besides, issues like not providing food, clothes and other essentials will also  be counted as grounds for separation. In case of separation, the woman has the right to mehar.  
To avoid controversy, the new Nikahnama also rules that three forms should be filled in during nikah — one each for  the marriage bureau, the bride and groom and the quazi.
Muslim women had criticised the model Nikahnama of the AIMPLB, released in 2005, saying it failed to address the contentious issue of “triple talaq”."

National Commission for Women has demanded a ban on instantaneous triple talaq or talaq-e-bidat and polygamy in its affidavit to Supreme Court on the grounds that these practices are against the rights of Muslim women. “Triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), nikah halala and polygamy are unconstitutional because they compromise the rights of Muslim Women (or of women who are married into the Muslim community) to their disadvantage, which is detrimental to them and their children. Therefore, these practices should be strictly prohibited,” reads the affidavit.

The affidavit adds that the Commission supports the stand taken by the Centre in the Supreme Court last month. “The National Commission is herein supporting the stand taken by the Union of India and is adapting the affidavit filed by them.”
The NCW said that its submission before the court comes in the backdrop of several complaints made to it by aggrieved Muslim women. “The Commission is partaking of a large number of cases relating to women who have been at the receiving end of the practice of unilateral talaq.”
 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
NCW is a respondent in a case in SC on triple talaq and submitted its affidavit last Saturday. The Centre in its reply to the SC in October had opposed the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds of gender equality and secularism.
It also provided a list of Islamic countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Turkey, which have made reforms in their personal laws and banned talaq-e-bidat. The Centre also argued that the practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy cannot be regarded as an essential part of the religion and hence are not entitled to protection under Article 25 (Freedom to practice religion) of the Constitution.

The SC is hearing a batch of petitions against triple talaq. The first among these pleas was filed by Shayara Bano from Uttarakhand who challenged the practices like triple talaq, polygamy and “nikah halala” (a practice where divorced women, in case they want to go back to their husbands, have to consummate a second marriage) as being unconstitutional.
Two women divorced through triple talaq from Jaipur and Kolkata also approached the Court. Their petitions and a number of supportive pleas filed by Muslim women’s organisations have all been bunched together. Opposing these petitions in court are the Jamiat-Ulema -e-Hind (JUH) and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). AIMPLB had told the apex court that personal laws can’t be re-written in the name of reforms and that the validity of Muslim personal law “cannot be tested” as it derives from Quran.
Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which is also one of the petitioners in SC, spearheaded a signature campaign earlier this year in which over 50,000 Muslim women and men participated and sought a ban on triple talaq."

TARGETING BJP government again over demonetisation, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday claimed “India has lagged behind rather than becoming developed and people are spending their time in queues”. Addressing a rally in Rampur district as part of the second phase of his Vikas Rath Yatra, Akhilesh said: “The people of the country will punish this government for depriving them from using their own money… Shadi ka season chal raha hai. Bataiye kya koi pandit ko cheque deta hai? Is dukhi karne wali sarkaar ko janata hata degi (The wedding season is on… Will anyone give a cheque to a pandit? People will remove this government)”

Thoda sambhal ke rahiyega. Kuch aur naya bhi aa sakta hai (This government comes up with new things. It’s election time… Be careful, something new may also happen),” added Akhilesh.

He went on to dub the previous BSP government as ‘patthar wali saraak’, whose stones can still be found across Uttar Pradesh.
Minister Azam Khan, who accompanied Akhilesh, said: “People should not let Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS to decide whether talaq will be ‘one, two or three’. Our Shariyat will decide how many talaqs will be there and not the RSS.” He was referring to the Centre’s stand on banning triple talaq.
Earlier, Akhilesh took out his yatra atop a Mercedes bus from Moradabad to Azam’s native district Rampur. He inaugurated development projects in Moradabad and an artificial lake, a flyover and an auditorium in Azam’s Mohammad Ali Jauhar University and ‘Gandhi Samadhi’ in Rampur. Akhilesh also distributed laptops to 950 students."

A woman has accused her husband of sending “triple talaq” through a letter as she had objected to him already having a wife and sought the intervention of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath into the matter.
The woman has written a letter to the Chief Minister, Governor Ram Naik and officials of the labour department, where her husband works, seeking justice. The woman, who runs a computer centre, claimed that she got married on November 23 last year and her family had given a four-wheeler, jewellery worth around Rs 25 lakh and other items as dowry to her in-laws.
The next day, when she reached the in-laws’ house, she came to know that her husband is already married. When she raised objections, she was beaten up by her in-laws who told her to give them a different car, the woman alleged while speaking to mediapersons on Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She came back to her mother’s place a few days later. In January, she received a registered letter from her husband with the triple talaq message, she claimed, adding according to the letter set to her, the first mention of talaq was on the very day of her wedding. In her letter she sought justice and said her husband is a government employee and it is illegal for him to get married despite having a wife.
A passionate debate is on over the Centre’s stand to oppose “triple talaq” with some women politicians seeking its abolition, even as Muslim bodies accused the ruling dispensation of waging a “war” on their personal law. The controversy arose after the Law Commission sought feedback from the public on whether the practice of “triple talaq” should be abolished and whether a uniform civil code be made optional."

Wading into the debate over Uniform Civil Code (UCC) issue, Shiv Sena on Friday slammed the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), and said it is only opposing Law Commission’s questionnaire as India is a secular nation and had it been a Muslim country, they would have been forced to abide by the rules.

Party spokesperson Neelam Gohre told ANI that there is a need for legal discussion over the issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“There needs to be a change in lives of women. They (Muslim bodies) are being able to oppose the UCC only because they reside in a secular country. Had they been living in a country that followed Islamic laws, they would not dare to protest against the amendments in laws. There should be a debate on the issue and women should get justice,” she said.
“Laws in our country are based on religion. In the past also there have been amendments to laws for the Hindu and Catholic community as and when needed. . The questions is that if Christianity, Hindus sects have adopted changes in them then why is the Muslim board is having problems. And I don’t think it is to hurt anyone’s emotion,” she added.

Her comments came against the backdrop of the Law Commission’s decision to invite views on the debatable UCC issue.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), along with several other organisations associated with the Muslim community, has opposed the Law Commission’s questionnaire on the possibility of a UCC, declaring that the move amounts to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government declaring “war” on their religious rights.
The threat of Muslim organisations to “boycott” the law commission process also comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court hearing a challenge to triple talaq where the Centre termed the custom unconstitutional and violative of gender equality .
Accusing the government of waging “war” against the community and contending that the UCC, if implemented, will threaten the country’s pluralism, the organisations said they will start a campaign to withdraw the law commission’s move.

A 48-year-old man was arrested here on Tuesday for divorcing his second wife within a day of marrying her by sending a postcard with talaq written thrice on it. Police said that Mohammad Haneef, a resident of Hyderabad’s Bhavni Nagar, had married a divorcee on March 16 without divorcing his first wife. A day later, Haneef told her that he wanted a divorce immediately. He sent postcards with triple talaq written on them to both wives, who lodged police complaints accusing him of marrying them fraudulently and trying to get rid of them.

Deputy Commissioner of Police V Satyanarayana said that Haneef felt that his second wife could not bear him children and thus decided to divorce her.
“We have called for the marriage records from the qazi who performed the marriage. The wife has given us some information about what transpired between them and stated that after spending the night with her, Haneef suddenly decided he wanted a divorce. She said it was unfair and felt used for a night,’’ an official said. Haneef has been booked under Indian Penal Code’s sections 498 (cruelty) and 420 (cheating)."

Lashing out at the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal over its support to ‘triple talaq’ and opposition to Uniform Civil Code (UCC), the BJP on Sunday accused it of “pursuing a communal agenda” and termed it “the best teacher of communal politics” in the country.

“If any sitting chief minister and state government could be accused of running a communal agenda, it is Mamata Banerjee and her government. Mamata Banerjee’s vote-bank politics is making her party support the communal get-together of Muslim bodies on November 18 to oppose UCC and banning of ‘triple talaq’. Mamata Banerjee, being a woman herself, and her party MPs, are supporting ‘triple talaq’ which is against gender equality.

joined by two TMC MPs, Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali, the Shahi Imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque here, Syed Mohammad Nurur Rahman Barkati, had on Friday charged the Narendra Modi government with “trying to polarise the nation” by “imposing” Uniform Civil Code. In an all-out attack against the BJP government over the raging debate on ‘triple talaq’ and UCC, Sultan Ahmed a few days back had accused the saffron party of “trying to infringe upon the fundamental and religious rights of Muslims and flare up communal passions in the country”.
He had said the BJP should leave it to the Muslims of the country to decide on ‘triple talaq’.
Watch what else is making news:

 
“Who gave the BJP the right to decide what the Muslims will do with their religion and religious rights? The BJP is trying to infringe upon the fundamental and religious rights of the Muslims in the country.

He had also said that the issue of the saffron party’s “attempt to interfere” in ‘triple talaq’ and UCC would come up during the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s three-day triennial convention, starting November 18 in Kolkata. The TMC MP had said that if the BJP government was really so “concerned” about the condition of Muslim women, it should create jobs and higher education facilities for them and facilitate their “social empowerment”."

The low-profile Major’s individual achievement is priceless, but it doesn’t compensate for our collective failure. I feel sorry that Rathore will now suffer the iconic status of a sarkari mascot rather than an eye-opening inspiration for future champs.
Our sports administration must desist from its usual practice of claiming ownership on rare champions who flourish despite the system. Instead of showering Rathore with prizes now, they could have encouraged him with monetary and other help when he was just a budding talent. There are hundreds of others, fighting the apathy of our sports bureaucracy at this very moment. Our babus would do Rathore a great service if, instead of planning felicitations for him, they did some talent-spotting. Our sports establishments need to answer a few questions, it is time to investigate the mammoth rot within. The funds earmarked and spent every year in the name of spotting and nurturing talent is no mean sum. Similarly, there are expensive provisions for preparing our best medal prospects through overseas training. But our babus’ lack of vision and enterprise is no secret. And the huge non-productive workforce swallows a bulk of the allocation through wages and pensions. The result: a blame game.
Our sports establishment often blame the BCCI for hyping cricket at the cost of other games. In fact, it has become a national pastime to whip the BCCI. Given India’s current global standing in most sporting events and the lamentable state of the institutes that are responsible for the mess, it is understandable why the BCCI’s professional management of India’s cricketing affairs and the performance of the national team stick out like a sore thumb. It is also popularly believed that the BCCI enjoys unparalleled government support while other sports bodies are neglected. To set the record straight, let me state that the BCCI has not received a single penny from the Government so far. Not only this, following the Finance Ministry’s decision, cricketing activities no longer enjoy any tax exemption in India. India today cannot hold a Cricket World Cup or even a mini-World Cup, because there is no tax exemption. All other cricketing nations are given full tax exemptions by their governments.

Grooming them younghttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister’s idea of catching our top bureaucrats young is an excellent one. It’s time to review the obsolete system that allows only limited orientation of future officers, who already have set attitudes, values and perspectives. Not only should we ensure a full five-year grooming of our officers but, once inducted into the services, they should also undergo compulsory reorientation every three years. And an individual assessment of performance and growth should be undertaken at least every ten years.
This is especially true for the foreign service cadre, who need a radical change of perspective. The old order diplomacy has little relevance today. Global polarities have changed drastically, economic issues rule international ties like never before. Consequently, the neck-stiff-and-nose-in-the-air approach is totally counter-productive. Take our expats for example. We want to tap their vast resource pool, but our missions abroad are remarkably rigid in their handling of People of Indian Origin (PIOs) and the NRIs. Such arrogance must make way for friendly interface. Our officers abroad must find purposes to justify their brief, beyond holding cocktail parties, trying to pull strings in South Block and sending their children to piano classes.

Reforms from within
At a time when there is a heightened debate over the meaning and definition of secularism, it comes as welcome news that noted filmwriter Javed Akhtar’s efforts to make Muslims more progressive and liberal are getting good response. His organisation, Muslims For Secular Democracy, has overcome a shaky start and is on its way to building deep inroads into the Muslim community.
It is heartening to see that Akhtar is taking up the cudgels against the fundamentalist forces within the community, trying to convince Muslims that without a progressive and liberal mindset, things cannot change. He is directing his efforts towards convincing them on controversial issues like triple talaq, uniform civil code and Haj subsidy. Having faced initial resentment, primarily because of the influence of fundamentalist forces, he is gradually getting good response from the community. This was evident during Akhtar’s recent visit to Aligarh University, where he was widely supported by both students and teachers. Akhtar’s efforts to help Indian Muslims break their oppressive shell and enter the nation’s mainstream are truly laudable. I hope Muslim intellectuals and reformists will join hands with him for this noble cause.

Noted lyricist-poet Javed Akhtar today said that there should be an immediate ban on the practice of triple talaq but uniform civil code should be implemented only after proper discussion. When asked about his opinion on the topic that has been in the headlines, Akhtar said he has been vocal against the issue for many years. “I have always spoken against these things. Triple talaq should be banned immediately in any civil society. As far as uniform common civil code is concerned, I am not sure how far this is possible because our country is huge,” he said while addressing a session at the Sahitya AajTak event.
“I have always spoken against these things. Triple talaq should be banned immediately in any civil society. As far as uniform common civil code is concerned, I am not sure how far this is possible because our country is huge,” he said while addressing a session at the Sahitya AajTak event.
Akhtar said India has many traditions, cultures and sub-cultures and bringing them under one law would be a mammoth task.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The government should make a draft of civil code and put it on the net. There should be a draft, only then a discussion is possible. It should be discussed for a year.
“If there is any discrepancy, then the Constitution must prevail and there should be no confusion about this.”
The lyricist said politicians should remain silent on sensitive issues as they say right things with wrong intentions and weaken the cause. Asked whether there was a danger to freedom of expression, Akhtar said that was not entirely true.
“What happens is that when people take a stand… It sometimes is extreme but reality is somewhere in between. Some people say freedom of expression is over. That’s not true. I say whatever I feel like but it is also true that there are attempts against it.”
Taking potshots at extremists, Akhtar said, “Islam was always in danger but now Hindu religion is also in danger.”
Akhtar said the scene in Sholay where Dharmendra woos Hema Malini by hiding himself behind the statue of Shiva would not be possible today."

Jammu-Kashmir Congress chief on Sunday accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of “dividing” Muslims by raising the triple talaq issue and said it was “direct interference” in the religious affairs of the community which will have “dangerous consequences”.
“India being a democratic, multi-religion, multi-cultural country cannot afford to tolerate the interference in any religion. The much-hyped triple talaq issue, which is being debated and discussed continuously, is a direct interference in the religious affairs of Muslims and a ploy to implement Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the country,” Jammu Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said in a statement in Srinagar.

He said the UCC cannot be implemented in the country as “everyone has a right to practice his or her own religion according his or her belief”. Terming as an attempt to “divide” the Muslim community on the triple talaq by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government, the JKPCC chief said the Centre was “willfully misinterpreting” the issue as this law in Muslim religion is based on certain situations that are irrevocable in Muslim jurisprudence and cannot be challenged.
“The BJP has started targeting Muslims on the pretext of triple talaq. As they lack knowledge on the subject, they should desist from misinterpreting the issue merely to create division to implement UCC in the country, which is not only unfortunate, but unacceptable to every individual and religion in the country,” Mir said.
The Congress leader warned that interference in religious matters of the Muslims or any other religion by BJP is “fraught with dangerous consequences” and BJP should desist from such “anti-religious activities”.
“How can the people of any religion exercise the same laws that are being practiced by other religion with regard to their marriage contracts and vice-versa? Everything in the Muslim religion is practiced on the basis of Sharia laws which are irrevocable and cannot be challenged or debated, but the BJP leadership is hell bent upon to disintegrate the country on religious lines to divert the attention of people from its failures,” he said. Mir termed it as a “vicious campaign and ploy to create confusion” in the country.
“The Prime Minister should focus on governance and leave the triple talaq issue to Muslims, as they are well conversant with their religious laws,” he said. Targeting the ruling PDP in Jammu and Kashmir for remaining silent on the issue, he said PDP’s silence on the issue was very unfortunate.
“PDP, for the sake of remaining in power, supports every wrong initiative of the BJP at the Centre and does not bother about the emotions of the people. It is evident that PDP has surrendered its principles and conscience before the RSS with the fear of losing power in the State, but they must know people not only in Kashmir, but in other regions, are watching its anti-people activities,” Mir said."

As the election results this Saturday in Uttar Pradesh saw a repeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with the entire opposition being reduced to less than 100 seats, including the BSP and SP-Congress alliance, giving a clean sweep to the BJP, both the Congress and the SP camps started calling the alliance a wrong move. Experts say that firstly the message given by the alliance that they wanted to consolidate minority votes by coming together and then the BSP fielding 100 Muslim candidates to woo minorities against the BJP, made the task easier for the BJP.


Moreover, workers and leaders of both Congress and SP now admit that they could not convince the cadre at the grassroots level to support each other which reflected in the results. Not to mention about 20 seats which both Congress and SP candidates contested against each other and the Rastriya Lok Dal, which was leading in just one seat.
A few leaders in these parties feel that despite the work hard to consolidate the minority votes in their favour, the BJP also attracted votes of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Samajwadi Party leader and minister in the Akhilesh government, Ravidas Mehrotra, who was leading from Lucknow Central Assembly seat blamed the alliance for the loss that Samajwadi Party suffered this Saturday and maintained that the party would have done better if it had gone alone. Mehrotra was not alone, as Congress leaders also admitted that if they had continued with their “27 saal UP Behal” campaign they would have been better placed than present trend which shows the Congress at less than 10 seats.
“We first shouted `27 saal UP behal’, seeking a vote for change and then suddenly got along with the same party whose cycle we were calling “punctured”. Then, we tried to take Brahmins along by fielding Sheila Dikshit as chief ministerial candidate, she moved all across the state and then suddenly she was removed from the picture,” said a senior Congress leader, adding that either they should not have started the earlier campaign or they should not have entered into alliance after over one month campaign against BJP, SP and BSP.
“We had sown the seeds of change and BJP reaped it as we ended up into alliance with SP, after speaking about change of politics from SP-BSP” said another Congress leader.

With election trends showing BJP winning 244 seats and leading on another 77, it is also set to open its account in the so called Gandhi bastion i.e. of Amethi and Rae Bareli. Out of 10 seats in the two Lok Sabha seats represented by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, BJP is leading in six seats, Congress in two, and SP in two. Similar was the case in the Yadav dominated region of Etawah, Mainpur and Kannauj.
Mulayam Singh Yadav’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, for whom even Mulayam had campaigned along with Dimple and Congress leaders is far behind BJP candidate and former Congress state president Rita Bahuguna Joshi. Congress biggest hope in Varanasi, Ajai Rai, who had contested the Lok Sabha election against Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also trailing in third place behind BJP candidate Awadhesh Singh and Babulal of the BSP.
In 2012, the Samajwadi Party had won 224 seats, Bahujan Samaj Party had won 80 seats despite anti-incumbency, the BJP had won 47 and the Congress had won 28 seats."

It’s the unquestionable smell of spices churning in the slow-cooked biryani that first greets your nose in the narrow and rough alleys of Quresh Nagar in old Delhi on a lazy Sunday morning. That and the hurried activity at the many meat shops and the constant bumper-to-bumper traffic of battery e-rickshaws and cars define the charm of Quresh Nagar ward which is set to witness an interesting battle in the MCD elections later this month.
As per the notification issued by the state election commission in 2012, out of the 272 wards, 136 MCD wards have been reserved for women. Quresh Nagar is one such women-reserved ward but more than party politics and rivalry, it is the historical baggage and command of the Ismail family that has loomed over every MCD election in this area for decades. It is this magnetic pull that eventually forced the BJP to disown its initial policy of not giving tickets to kin of sitting councillors.

Here, in this area, it’s the name of former councillor Imran Ismail that’s talked about more than current candidate and his sister Rubina Begum or sitting councillor and his mother Hoor Bano. In posters, campaign material and even on the nameplate inside the local BJP office, this is evident. It is this family dynasty and the claims of its professed tutelage that keeps the BJP hopes up in this ward.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
So can a non-Ismail family member win from this ward?
Imran Ismail shrugs. “Our father won the elections and was in power from 1983 to 1990. The party could not win another election till 2007. Despite the party’s multiple experiments in between, they could not secure this seat,” said 49-year-old Imran. “The party put their faith in us in 2007 again and we won. My mother too came to power in 2012,” he added effectively indicating that it’s their turf.
When asked about the party’s deviation, Imran Ismail said, “Dekhiye, kuch apvaad hoti hain seats. Unhi apvaadon mein se yeh hai. (There are some exceptions everywhere. This is one such exception.)”
Locals too believe the Ismail family will manage another win from this ward. “We will vote for them (Ismails) because of their work. The Kejriwal-government has to be blamed for not letting the MCD work. If they don’t release funds, how will the workers get salaries? Everybody needs money,” said Md Rashid, a local shopkeeper. “Modi-wave will help in securing win for all three MCD departments,” he added.

And yet there are those who question Rubina’s candidature on grounds of her being a proxy candidate for her brother Imran who is more assertive and vocal about issues. The tone and tenor of their separate interviews to indianexpress.com reflected the same.
From the Aam Aadmi Party to the recent Uttar Pradesh election’s influence on the MCD polls, Imran’s answers were elaborate and in sync with the rhetoric of the BJP.
“Inhone (AAP) kahaa tha Delhi ko modernise karenge, Shanghai banayenge. Mujhe toh nahi lagta Shanghai haan modern kabristan and modern shamshanghat zaroor banadenge. Jab aadmi hi nai rahenge toh kya shanghai banayenge. (AAP had said they’d modernise Delhi and make it like Shanghai. I think instead of Shanghai they might just turn it into graveyard. They won’t be able to turn the city into Shanghai unless people stay here),” he said while sitting in the party office in Quresh Nagar. When questioned if they consider AAP as a strong competitor in the elections, Imran said, “Before Punjab and Goa assembly elections, we thought we had competition. Now, it’s all very clear. They will be wiped out.”

While Imran spoke confidently of the party’s achievements pan-India and listed the work done by them in the ward, Rubina, on the other hand, had to be prodded often by her husband who sat alongside her. When asked about the issues concerning the people of the ward, she said there were no problems. “Agar koi pareshaani aayegi toh main kaam karungi (If any problems come up, I will work for the people),” was her standard response. She was also asked to share the problems faced by the women of the area. The answer was prompted by her husband.
“Shiksha” he said and Rubina added after a pause, “Shiksha ki bohot zyada pareshaani hai. Kuch aur cheezein bhi hai. Jaise shaadi-byaah ki bhi hai (There are lot of issues with regard to education Other problems like marriage and all are also there).” With the lotus symbol pinned to his kurta, Rubina’s husband sat during the entire interview, prompting words to her whenever she failed to answer the questions.
Rubina, a 12th pass, claimed she has worked for her people through Md Ismail Welfare Society, a family trust. Her responsibilities included working for distribution of books and clothes among the needy and their marriage. When questioned on BJP’s stand on Uniform Civil Code and triple talaq, she was silent for a moment. “Yeh aalimon ka maamla hai, main kuch nai keh sakti (Religious leaders can talk on this matter. I can’t comment anything on this.)” she added after her husband’s cue.

(Source: Express Photo)
Rubina’s candidature points towards a common occurrence in Indian system — women in politics being accompanied by shadow male leaders, who are most often related to them. The practice has become so internalised that many are unable to see the underlying problem. Ahmed Din, a 60-year-old businessman residing in the area, confirmed the same. “Imran hi kaam dekhega Rubina ke jeetne ke baad. Yeh ladies hain, housewife hain, kya kaam karengi (Imran will look after the work once Rubina wins. She’s a woman, a housewife. What work can she do?)” he told indianexpress.com

(Source: Express Photo)
The assumption probably stems from Rubina’s lack of political knowledge. During her interview, Rubina was quick to critique Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “Sirf baatein hi baatein karte, sirf vaade hi vaade karte hain (He just makes tall claims),” she said after her husband said the same. However, when asked to react on AAP’s claims of reducing electricity and water bills, she took a six-second pause to smile, look towards her husband and then said, “Kya boloon main iss baare mein? (What should I say on this?)” On the reasons that led to the defeat of the BJP in the 2015 Assembly elections, Rubina was again clueless. A long pause and an awkward smile later, she said, “Nahi pata iss baare mein mujhe (I don’t know about this)”
Rubina’s claims of ‘koi samasya nahi hai’ also rang hollow with some locals.
36-year-old Nazrana Begum said that she wanted to vote for someone who would work for the ward. “There is a nala near my house which is broken since months. Nobody came to fix it despite repeated requests. Demonetisation affected my husband’s business drastically. So I will not vote for BJP,” she said. When asked about her alternate choice, she wondered out loud saying, “Sab hi toh aise hain. Koi kaam nahi karta. I am so fed-up that I am considering voting for no one this time,” she said before stomping away.
Whether the Ismail family’s connect with voters in Quresh Nagar would work will only be answered on April 25, the counting day. But it is clear that Rubina has a long path ahead to imbibe political acumen. In the interview, during an answer she said she believed in ‘hamara saath, ‘hamara vikas’ before her husband corrected her to say the actual BJP slogan – ‘sabka saath, ‘sabka vikas’."

Farmers from Tamil Nadu have been protesting in the heart of the National Capital to gain the attention of the Central Government. In a desperate attempt, the farmers drank urine in a bid to protest over drought relief funds and waiver of farmers’ loans. These farmers said they were doing so as there is a lack of drinking water in the state.
These helpless farmers have been protesting at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since March 14. They are protesting to demand a drought relief package of Rs 40,000 crore, farm loan waiver and setting up of Cauvery Management Board by the Centre.

To grab attention, they had taken up various startling albeit non-violent measures. From protesting with the skulls of dead farmers to parading naked or holding dead rodents in their mouth — the distressed farmers have done it all, but their protests have fallen on deaf ears.
While politicians in Tamil Nadu are still busy with bypolls and grappling with the AIADMK merger issue, the Central government has not paid any heed to their protests. On Saturday, pictures of farmers drinking urine went viral. Netizens shared the images across social media platform and joined their voice too.

Amid a raging debate over Uniform Civil Code and triple talaq in the country, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said they will deliberate on the line of action to be taken over the issues, in its upcoming convention in the city.
Watch What Else Is Making News 

Describing the twin issues as an “infringement of the personal law and fundamental rights of Muslims”, the AIMPLB said it would give a call for formation of a “secular platform” to counter the BJP and RSS’s “evil designs”.
“The BJP-RSS is trying to infringe into the personal and fundamental rights of Muslims. This will never be tolerated. The upcoming convention will deal with the issues,” Trinamool Congress MP and chairman of AIMPLB organising committee, Sultan Ahmed told PTI.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to Ahmed, the AIMPLB usually sticks to only Muslim personal laws which broadly cover marriage, talaq, succession and adoption-related issues, but this time it will step beyond its periphery and speak up against religious intolerance in the country.
AIMPLB is an umbrella organisation which has representatives from all Muslim sects, theological schools and religious orders. The body is reportedly the highest decision-making body on Muslim personal laws.
Ahmed will formally meet the state administration this week to finalise the venue for the three-day Kolkata convention starting November 18.
“We will sit with the state administration and police authorities and finalise the details this week. We have two venues in mind–Park Circus Maidan and Mohammedan Sporting Club for the public meeting,” he said.

In a surprising move, the BJP on Saturday announced Yogi Adityanath, the controversial MP from Gorakhpur, as the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, putting an end to all the suspense which has been brewing ever since the party won a historic mandate in the state. While speculation was rife over the names of Rajnath Singh, Manoj Sinha, Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, the saffron party ultimately chose Yogi Adityanath. Known for following a staunch Hindutva ideology and his strong anti-Muslim statements, Yogi certainly was not the leader people of Uttar Pradesh were expecting to be their chief minister. The decision to give him charge of a state as important as UP, only seems to endorse the thinking that the BJP still prefers Ram Temple over development.

But with how the BJP managed to polarise the electorate in the last phases of poll campaigning, Yogi’s selection should not come as a surprise. After talking about demonetisation, black money, corruption and Akhilesh’s alleged bad governance during initial campaigning, the top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, changed track to rehtoric like kabristan and shamsaan ghaat while raising issues like religious discrimination in the distribution of laptops by the state government. This was seen as a bid to win Hindu voters, divided on caste lines.
However, even before the state went to polls, supporters of Yogi were seeing a potential CM in him. The man who has represented Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency for a record five times, commands a good Hindu support in eastern UP. Dissent within the BJP was visible when Yogi was not declared as the party’s CM face in UP. His Hindu Yuva Wahini fielded separate candidates in the Assembly constituencies of Gorakhpur region. While Yogi denied this, the rift helped the saffron party win all constituencies in Gorakhpur region, showing his mass support.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even before the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was declared, some of the developments, like demand for renaming of Muslim dominated Deoband as Dev Vrad and the attempts by some fringe elements to hoist a saffron flag atop a mosque, have already made some quarters uneasy. And with Yogi Adityanath being named the CM, apprehensions about the path the new government will take has only grown.
BJP’s impressive show in Muslim dominated areas in the polls was a reflection of a new trend of Muslim support to the saffron party. With the issue of triple talaq featuring in Modi’s poll speeches, a good number of Muslim women showed trust in the prime minister. But how long this the trust remains intact will depend to a large extent on Yogi’s governance."

(Ravi Kanojia/Express file)
What led the Centre to take this stand?
Almost three decades after the Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case raised questions on the sanctity of personal laws, comes the Shayara Bano case that has once again stirred the religious orthodoxy versus gender justice debate. In February this year, Shayara, a resident of Kashipur in Uttarakhand who was given instantaneous triple talaq by her husband, approached the Supreme Court. Her petition challenged the long-standing practices of talaq-e-bidat (instantaneous triple talaq), nikah halala (prohibition on remarriage with the divorced husband without consummating marriage with another man) and polygamy. Now, the Union government has filed an affidavit that in-principle supports the petitioner’s demand for doing away with such practices.

Does the petition come in conflict with Islamic principles?
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, allows Indian Muslims to be governed by the Shariat (Islamic law), based on the Quran and Hadith (utterances of the Prophet), in matters of personal law. In the absence of any codification even within the Quranic framework, however, the Shariat has been subject to interpretations by the Muslim clergy, who have held these practices as sacrosanct.
But stating that Muslim women, merely by virtue of their gender and religion, are being denied their right to equal protection under law and protection from discrimination, Shayara’s petition argues that talaq-e-bidat has no foundation in the Quran and that polygamy is not an integral part of Islam. It refers to several scholars who hold that in Islam, triple talaq is valid only if the three utterances are spread over a period of 90 days and after several attempts at reconciliation have failed.

Have there been cases in the past that have raised similar questions?
While there have been several cases that have challenged matters of the Muslim personal law, Shayara’s is the first to challenge it citing the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The petition invokes Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 that deal with the right to equality before law, protection against discrimination on grounds of sex or religion, protection of life and personal liberty and freedom of religion respectively. With special mention to Article 25, it holds that it merely protects religious faith and not practices that are against “public order, morality or health”. It, however, steers clear of invoking the argument of the Uniform Civil Code.

While the petition was originally filed by the lawyers of Shayara Bano, over the last several months, it has been clubbed with several other petitions, including those filed by a few other affected women. Muslim scholars such as Irfan Ali Engineer through his Centre for Study of Society and Secularism and several Muslim women’s groups such as the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (which has over 1 lakh members across 15 states) and Bebaak Collective (coalition of seven Muslim women groups across India) have also filed intervening petitions supporting Shayara’s demand. Also expected to join the fray is the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board, which has in the past drafted its own Sharia Nikahnama that gives equal rights to men and women and repeatedly spoken against triple talaq.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has, however, decried all the groups that have spoken out in favour of reforming the Muslim personal law. The AIMPLB’s affidavit opposes any attempts at interference by the Supreme Court in matters of religious and cultural rights. It states that triple talaq, in fact, saves women the ignominy of divorce proceedings that could otherwise damage her chances of re-marriage and prevents the “murder of wives” at the hands of their husbands who may want to divorce them. It also backs polygamy on the grounds that “an unlawful mistress is more harmful for social fabric than a lawful second wife”.

So how did the Centre come into the picture?
In March this year, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to make public a report by the high-level Pam Rajput committee on the status of women in India — the committee has sought a ban on gender discriminatory practices propagated by personal laws. It was only this month, however, that the Ministry of Law finally filed its affidavit where it took a stand that personal laws, regardless of the fact that they are meant to preserve the plurality and diversity of the country, “must be examined in the light of the overarching goal of gender justice and dignity of women”. It has also asked for re-examination of a 1952 Bombay High Court judgment that held that Article 13 of the Constitution doesn’t cover personal laws. Article 13 states that laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights are void. To drive in the point that such practices are not integral to Islam, the Union ministry gives detailed examples of personal law reforms in 10, mainly Muslim majority, countries. The union government’s affidavit states, “Secularism being a hallmark of Indian democracy, no part of its citizenry ought to be denied access to fundamental rights, much less can any section of a secular society be worse off than its counterparts in theocratic countries, many of which have undergone reforms.”"

The two fundamental axes of social inequality in India are caste and gender. Caste distinctions were central to orthodox Hinduism. Their influence was so pervasive that they carried over even when people converted to faiths based on more egalitarian principles. In India, Muslims and Christians also practised (and often still practise) caste-based discrimination.
As for gender, Hinduism is notable for having many women represented in its pantheon. However, while there are women deities, until very recently there were no women priests. Successive shankaracharyas have argued that women are not authorised to read or interpret sacred texts. In Islam, the discrimination is arguably even greater, with no women priests of course, and often, segregated worship as well. The religious texts of Hinduism and Islam are also heavily loaded in favour of patriarchy. No doubt, through selective quotations from the Quran or the Vedas, one can claim they respected or even revered women, but taken as a whole, there is no question that Hinduism and Islam are both religions where men are held to be superior, and thus mandated to dominate family, society and community life.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A major challenge to religious discrimination was the bhakti movement. Poets such as Tukaram and Eknath in Maharashtra, Kabir and Mira in north India, and the Alvars of the Tamil country, preached (and practised) what we might call equality in the eyes of god. In the orthodox tradition, scripture was interpreted only by authorised male priests; while low castes were excluded from places of worship. The bhakti movement challenged this orthodoxy by arguing that individuals did not need priestly instruction to forge their own path to the divine. In approaching god, said (or sang) the bhakti poets, personal devotion and faith mattered more than social status or family position. I have been reading a fine book on the 15th-century bhakti poet, Narasinha Mehta, written by the literary scholar Neelima Shukla-Bhatt. A living presence in his native Gujarat, where his poems are still read and his songs still sung, Narasinha was also a considerable influence on Mahatma Gandhi. He composed “Vaishnava Jana To”, Gandhi’s favourite hymn, and also first used the term “Harijan”.
Gandhi took these traditions of heterodoxy further and deeper. Through the 1920s and 1930s, he campaigned against untouchability, evoking horror and anger among sants and shankaracharyas but much support among modern-minded Hindus. Meanwhile, from the other end of the social spectrum, Ambedkar was conducting his own heroic struggle against caste discrimination.
In the 1930s, many temples opened their doors to Dalits. The process accelerated after Independence. In a vast majority of Hindu temples today, Dalit and Suvarna worship together. Belatedly, Hindu priests have granted that in the eyes of god, all Hindus are equal.
But, as recent events in Sabarimala and the Shani temple show, the same broadmindedness has not been extended to women. And, as the controversy over the Haji Ali shrine in Mumbai demonstrates, Muslim women also do not enjoy equal rights when it comes to patterns and forms of worship. In the eyes of god, as interpreted by mullahs and pandits, men are still the superior sex.
Dalits may have largely won the battle in the domain of religion, either by acquiring the rights every other temple worshipper has, or by following Ambedkar and converting to Buddhism. But in the realm of everyday social practice, they continue to face grievous discrimination. It used to be claimed, or believed, that caste discrimination was relatively less active in the cities. But as the tragic suicide of Rohith Vemula showed, this may not really be the case. In the science faculties of an elite Central university, men and women are still being judged by which caste they were born into.
Meanwhile, gender discrimination is also pervasive in everyday life in India. Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar all lived and worked for an India where women and men would be fully equal. Yet, 70 years on, deep inequalities of gender persist: In the family, in the workplace, in public life, in the bus and train and plane, and on the street. In all these spheres, women are denied dignity, respect, education, employment, promotion, and voice. They are often subject to horrific violence too.
There are three kinds of equality a modern, tolerant, humane society should strive for. Two I have already spoken of: Equality in the eyes of god, and equality in everyday social life. The third, of course, is equality before the law. The Constitution of India assured equality before the law to all citizens regardless of age, caste, gender or religion. It further allowed for affirmative action for Dalits and Adivasis to compensate for past discrimination against them. Much later, an amendment to the Constitution mandated affirmative action for women in local bodies, likewise an acknowledgement that history and culture had discriminated against them.
There is, however, one aspect of the law in which gender discrimination persists. This is the domain of family and personal law. The personal law reforms of the 1950s (the handiwork of Ambedkar and Nehru) gave Hindu women far greater rights than they had previously enjoyed. But they left Muslim women untouched. Customs like polygamy and triple talaq, which are completely repugnant to a democratic sensibility, are thus still legally valid.
In any case, equality before the law does not have much meaning unless it is accompanied by equality in social practice. And, in a society where believers far outnumber atheists or agnostics, equality in the eyes of god likewise remains an ideal worth striving for.
All three forms of equality are important, each feeding into or influencing the other. All three must be pursued patiently, and simultaneously. India desperately needs a gender-sensitive common civil code that brings all citizens under its ambit. Indians need to press the managements of the country’s temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras towards less discriminatory practices, so that women can enter and worship in any part of a shrine, so that women can, if they so wish, become pujaris, mahants, maulanas, imams, priests and bishops too.

Legal and religious reforms are important, but in the context of caste and gender discrimination, the reform of individual and collective behaviour may be more important still. The treatment of Dalits and women in India falls shockingly short of what the Constitution-makers hoped, and what any sense of decency or morality expects. To be sure, our claims to being the world’s largest democracy are vitiated by the venality and corruption of our political leaders. But they are vitiated far more by the everyday behaviour towards Dalits by upper-caste Hindus, and towards women by men of all castes and religions."

While India respects freedom of religion and faith, “unreasonable or discriminatory” practises cannot be held integral to it and protected, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Thursday defending the Centre’s stand on triple talaq amid a raging debate on the contentious issue.

He cited the practice of “untouchability” to assert that religious practices need to be in accord with constitutional values and emphasised that “gender justice, gender equality and gender dignity” were at the core of the Narendra Modi government’s priority.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“… we respect freedom of religion and freedom of faith which are protected by the fundamental rights. But every unreasonable or discriminatory practice cannot be held integral to faith….
“For instance, can anyone claim that untouchability against Dalits flows from my faith and I can practice it. Therefore, religious practices also need to be in accord with the constitutional values,” Prasad told PTI in an interview.
The government had on October 7 opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq among Muslims, maintaining that it cannot be regarded as an essential part of religion.
Responding to questions on the issue of triple talaq, the senior BJP leader said a set of women cannot lose their rights for being from a particular religion.
“Can in a secular country like India a big chunk of women be forced to live in a state of vulnerability only on the ground that they belong to a particular religion?” he questioned.
Noting that gender equality stands embedded right from the day the Constitution came into existence, the minister said development and empowerment of women were also among government’s priorities.
He said the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme has become a big movement and the Modi government’s campaign against infanticide shows that the government takes the issue of gender equality seriously.
“You recall his famous statement on Vijay Dashmi day (in Lucknow) that for one Sita, Lanka was burnt and you kill a Sita every day in the womb… in mudra yojna, 70 per cent beneficiaries are women. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna of the postal department has crossed more than a crore…revolutionary,” Prasad said.
The Law Minister said some people are calling end of the practice of triple talaq a violation of Sharia or personal law.
“It is only in response to their apprehension that we have raised this issue, also listed in our affidavit, that a large number of Muslim countries have regulated triple talaq. They have provided for arbitration, mediation, conciliation as a first step,” he said.
Many countries have abolished the practice all together by law, including Iran, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
“Now the straight question I am raising is, if declared Islamic or predominantly Muslim countries have regulated triple talaq, which has not been found to be violative of personal law or sharia, how can the same argument be relevant in a declared secular country like India?,” he said.
He also rejected suggestions that government is pushing for uniform civil code as part of its agenda.
“This whole apprehension that we are bringing uniform civil code or it is an agenda is completely baseless. The two need not be linked at all. The Law Commission is examining it and let there be a widest consultation possible by all the stakeholders,” he said.
He said the people opposing the common code should tell so to the law panel which has sought public opinion on the subject.
“Say your opposition also. But the government presently has nothing to say. Let the Law Commission take a view. The entire argument of any hidden agenda is something which I deny with all the authority at my command,” he said.
The minister recalled that Article 44 which talks of a common code was made a part of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly which consisted of towering leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, B R Ambedkar, Maulana Azad and many others."

Response of political parties to the Law Commission questionnaire on uniform civil code has so far been lukewarm with only BSP responding to it by slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly imposing the agenda of the RSS on the people. Responding to the law panel’s request to answer the questionnaire, BSP General Secretary Satish Misra said the party is attaching a press statement issued by Mayawati on October 25 in Lucknow.

Instead of answering the 16 questions put out by the law panel, the BSP, in its letter sent last week, said the press statement is its response to the questionnaire. The BSP statement said the BJP has been trying to impose the agenda of the RSS on the people ever since it came to power at the Centre.
In the statement, Mayawati had also stressed on B R Ambedkar’s vision behind the right to freedom of religion enshrined in the Constitution. Seeking to widen its consultation on the contentious issue of uniform civil code, the Law Commission had last month asked all national and state political parties to share their views and plans to invite their representatives for interaction on the subject.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The panel has sent a questionnaire on the subject to the parties and asked them to send their views by November 21. The Centre’ move asking the law panel to examine the issue had assumed significance as the Supreme Court recently said it would prefer a wider debate, in public as well as in court, before taking a decision on the constitutional validity of ‘triple talaq’, which many complain is abused by Muslim men to arbitrarily divorce their wives.
For the first time in India’s constitutional history, the Centre had on October 7 opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds of gender equality and secularism. The development came after a Muslim woman, who was divorced by her husband through a phone call from Dubai, challenged the Muslim practices of polygamy, triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat) and nikah halala, leading the Supreme Court to seek response from the Centre on her plea."

The Darul Uloom, Deoband, had issued an edict in 2008 that “Muslims must refrain from cow slaughter, beef-eating or trading in cow hide and Shariat doesn’t allow beef-eating if it’s prohibited under law”. But it was never followed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Now, the heads of Sufi shrines who recently gathered at Ajmer Dargah have “called for an ordinance on national ban on beef”. The Dargah Diwan “also condemned the practice of triple talaq” and “gave a call to shun it immediately”. Subsequently, the All India Shia Personal Law Board also “endorsed the proposal to ban triple talaq and declared its support for a ban on cow slaughter across the country”. Listing these as the “side-effects” of Adityanath’s elevation as UP CM, the editorial says the “new dawn of reforms and inclusive version of Islam will stem from the land of Bharat”.
Taking on Trinamool
An article in Organiser says that during the upcoming panchayat polls, the Trinamool Congress is finding “it difficult to face public ire” generated due to its “anti-Hindu acts”. The ruling party is already “disturbed over the unprecedented saffron upsurge seen during the Ramanavami celebration”. The massive scale of the celebrations forced even TMC supporters to take out Ramanavami processions in several areas. The developments confirm an “assertion of one’s Hindu identity which has been, till now, frowned upon by the Communists, Congress and TMC”. “The ruling TMC’s shameful attempts to curtail religious freedom of Hindus has a long history,” the article says, and lists various instances where the “hijab-clad (Mamata) Banerjee stands accused of being anti-Hindu simply to appease hardline Islamists”.
In mid-April, 40 central-level BJP leaders are travelling to Bengal and “their ultimate goal is to take on the TMC in the panchayat elections”. Political pundits of Bengal are saying that “this election is going to experience a new voting pattern” as the BJP “is getting very good response in “booth committee formation” programme”. People even in the Maoist-hit areas of Midnapore and Jhargram are keen to join the BJP.
Hindus Terrorised 
An article in Panchjanya says that Ayodhya is a “sacred path” to the rise of new India. One can now see the emergence of the Hindu who, armed with courage and valour, would link this rise with Ayodhya and the honour

of Hindus.
A Hindu, by character, “wishes for happiness, peace and moksha for all”. His mantras and prayers are for the welfare of entire mankind, not just for the followers of his faith.
However, this Hindu is now “terrorised” in the entire Indian subcontinent. The word “Hindu Rashtra” was included in the Nepalese constitution in 1962, but it was later removed following an alliance between the Indian Communists and the Nepalese Maoists.
One regularly hears about the “cries of Hindus” and the “kidnapping of young Hindu girls” in Pakistan. “Bangladesh has become a factor of anti-Hindu jihad,” it says, adding that “it does not have any Hindu cabinet minister even though it has over one crore Hindus”. “The Hindus of Bangladesh had the biggest confidence-boosting  experience of their lives when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Dhaka and performed prayers at Maa Dhakeshwari,” it says.
In Sri Lanka, Hindu Tamils still do not have “equal economic and educational opportunities”. “Over 30,000 Hindu Tamil refugees are living without citizenship near Chennai,” it adds."

When there is no compulsion,what is the need for any resolution or fatwa? Meanwhile,the reaffirmation of an earlier resolution of the Darul Uloom condemning terror is good news  but at the same time we must name the LeT,Jaish and others and send a strong message.
The home minister should be careful about the bouquets,as the brickbats can be as swift.  As citizens of a secular democratic country with a vibrant judiciary,fatwas have little meaning in present-day India.  Salman Khursheeds timely rejoinder about the futility of a fatwa about non-issues and the need for addressing the real,burning issues   education and employability of Indian Muslims,for example  are laudable. I wish resolutions at Deoband had addressed the following questions: Why do Indian Muslims have the highest levels of illiteracy,both male and female,in the country? Why do we have the highest number of school drop-outs? Why do we have the lowest representation in both the public and the private sector? What steps are we taking to stop pernicious recruiters who lure young impressionable minds towards terror ideologies?
A failure to tackle the rapid socio-economic slide will push the faithful instead towards being the last amongst the least. With the Shiv Sena and the VHP joining in,the zealots will raise this needless debate to a crescendo overshadowing real issues.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The legal implications of the fatwa even in Islamic countries are often overruled by the ruling dispensation. There is a binding rule that saves the fatwa pronouncements from creating judicial havoc,even in a country like Saudi Arabia. It is unanimously agreed that a fatwa is only binding on its author. One example widely cited that emphasises this is the statement of Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Al-Obeikan,then vice-minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia,in an 2006 interview with an Arabic daily: Even the fatwas of the official  authority (official Saudi fatwa institute) is binding on no one,whether individuals or the state. Al-Obeikan was promoted recently,as an advisor to the royal court. The tendency to nevertheless sometimes present a fatwa as mandatory  even by leading religious authorities  should be fought.
The Sheikh of al-Azhar in Cairo,Muhammad Sayid Tantawy,who is the leading religious authority in the Sunni establishment in Egypt (alongside the Mufti of Egypt) said the following about fatwas issued by himself: They are not binding,but they are not just whistling in the wind either; individuals are free to accept them,but Islam recognises that extenuating circumstances may prevent it. According to the traditional principles of jurisprudence,the fatwa must be adequate with the needs of the contemporary world in order to be valid.
Over 50 Muslim-majority countries have over the last fifty years managed to modernise and alter personal laws in tune with changing societal norms. Egypt has announced 12 per cent reservation for women in Parliament,Saudi Arabia is opening coeducation universities for science and technology,many Islamic countries have banned the triple talaq at one go and women are being educated  and incentivised to work in all sectors. Every madrasa or school outside the subcontinent follows a government-approved curriculum which includes modern life sciences. All these reforms have come from within the religious systems,as they have a larger chance of success. But our religious clergy is reluctant to move on such contemporary issues.
This politics of isolation is ill-fated in a multi-plural democracy like India. In the last sixty years the community has consistently slipped to the lowest rung of the knowledge and economic ladder,caught in a vicious trap the helps nobody but self-serving political and religious leaderships. A growing revulsion against such leadership is beginning to be apparent  especially in the present generation of young,educated Muslims whose sole aim is to be competitive and employed gainfully.

M.G. Vaidya (‘The price of personal law, IE, November 1) makes chilling reading. It is not easy to believe that in a democracy, someone could seriously argue a case for disenfranchisement of citizens. But that is exactly what Vaidya’s suggestion to the Law Commission does. It is unlikely that Vaidya would not know or remember the opposition by many Hindu (and Hindutva) organisations to the reform of Hindu laws in the 1950s. So, we do not know if he would disenfranchise those opponents retrospectively. But it is clear that his variant of the argument is oblivious to nuance. So, he would not be interested in questions such as those that some feminists raise over “uniformity” and application of Hindu reforms to all communities. Nor will he find merit in the argument that the problem of triple talaq could be separated from the larger task of bringing all personal laws under a uniform umbrella.
However, in order to simplify the debate, let us not get into those intricacies. Triple talaq is a practice that certainly needs redressal — and, it must be repeated — not because it is a Hindu-Muslim question, but because it is a question of gender justice. It must also be stressed that reform of religious practices and interpretations of religion is a larger, long-term, but welcome process. Having said this, we need to turn to the larger issue. In his enthusiasm to uphold one provision in the Constitution (Article 44), Vaidya has chosen to undermine the larger spirit of diversity and democracy that informs the Constitution. Disenfranchisement does not fit into that spirit.
Vaidya’s piece and his suggestion to the Law Commission need to be read not only in terms of overenthusiasm about Article 44 (one wishes he would be equally enthusiastic about not just other provisions of the Constitution, but also about the spirit of the Constitution). Though the piece smacks of contempt for Muslims, which is not unknown to the ideological tradition he belongs to, the larger danger is not just Muslim-baiting either. Beyond a hackneyed and partial reading of the Constitution and beyond the well-known antipathy toward the Muslim community, the argument makes more dangerous reading for its bold attempt to openly canvass for a “Hindu” democracy.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Religious beliefs of non-Hindus or customs of “so-called” (his word) Adivasis would invite disenfranchisement — so, despite all the social engineering, Hindutva ideology is back to emphasising that this nation belongs to mainly caste Hindus; others may live here but would not be treated as part of the nation. Within this framework of the Hindu nation, democracy is fine; but if one is thinking of a diverse social context, then second rate citizenship is on offer. Critics of Hindutva have often charged the Hindutva political forces of supporting second-rate citizenship. Now, Vaidya’s initiative confirms those criticisms. In the homogenised Hindu national space, “others” can only be second-grade citizens.
There is something more sinister to Vaidya’s suggestion. One always thought the vote is the cardinal principle of citizenship. By recommending disenfranchisement, Vaidya’s piece attempts to link acceptance of everything the state does to citizenship. If you do not accept something the state does, you are no more a citizen. Though his argument is specious about the meaning of the word “shall”, the real point he makes is this: Legislatures are creations of the Constitution, therefore, not agreeing with policies and decisions of legislatures invites forfeiture of citizenship. That is, if you do not accept the UCC, you lose the right to vote. But why the UCC alone? This logic can apply to many such “fundamental” disagreements with legislative assemblies or the parliament.
Attempts to draft personal laws based on uniform principles is an important challenge, but the enthusiasm of the likes of Vaidya can only make that task more difficult because no community would like to acquiesce with a constitutional provision with the proverbial gun of disenfranchisement held to its head. Only recently, a Union minister stated, “You cannot have a uniform civil code without a broad consensus.” (Venkaiah Naidu, IE, October 27). So, do we believe the minister or the inner voice of Hindutva?"

(Representational Image)
The Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear various petitions on the Constitutional legitimacy of triple talaq and polygamy in the Muslim community. Several women have filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice. The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.
WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS

One of the petitioner’s Shayara Bano, 38, stirred a hornet’s nest after she moved the Supreme Court to challenge the triple talaq under Muslim personal law, under which a man simply has to utter ‘talaq’ thrice to divorce his wife.
Shayara has also challenged in the apex court the concept of ‘nikah-halal’, under which a woman must consummate another marriage in order to go back to her first husband if she wants to. She also wants to outlaw polygamy within a Muslim marriage.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word “talaq” thrice as unconstitutional.
The court further observed that the triple talaq practice sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.
“Triple talaq is unconstitutional, it violates the rights of Muslim women,” ruled the High Court, adding that no personal law board is above the Constitution.
However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her. The rights bestowed by religion can’t be questioned in a court of law, it said."

Rubbishing opposition’s charge that the Modi government is interfering in Shariat matters, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday welcomed the ongoing debate on triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code, saying discussion is a sign of healthy democracy. “The Modi government has not been interfering in religious or Shariat matters. Some people are spreading this misconception for their narrow political gains. They are trying to divert the attention from the government’s agenda of development for all, including minorities,” he said.
Noting that there is nothing wrong with the ongoing debate, the Union MoS for Minority Affairs said, “There should be a positive discussion on triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code. Debate and discussion are important part of any democracy. National consensus should be achieved through national debate.”
Addressing a “Progress Panchayat” at Jagatpur Patti village near Jaspur in Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district, he claimed many political parties are accusing the Narendra Modi government of interfering in religious and Shariat matters as part of a “negative propaganda” against the Centre. “Development agenda alone can defeat people and parties with such negative agendas,” the Union Minister said and claimed that “masters of corruption” are unable to digest a “corruption-free, development oriented governance” provided by the Prime Minister.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Modi had succeeded in providing clean, honest and transparent governance which has resulted in socio-economic empowerment of the poor, weaker sections and the minorities at the ground level, Naqvi claimed. He said ‘Progress Panchayat’ has nothing to do with votes, but it is a “draft of development”. The Union minister said the objective of ‘Progress Panchayat’, launched on September 29 from Mewat in Haryana, is to ensure that the benefits of Centre’s schemes reach the targeted beneficiaries and get to a feedback on the hurdles in implementation of the schemes at the ground level.
Observing that preparing policies and schemes on paper is not enough, Naqvi said, “We have to make sure that these schemes, aimed at welfare of the needy, are producing results on the ground.” “The ministry should go to people, listen to their problems and resolve those. Then only we will be able to provide the fruits of development to the last person of the society,” he said.
Naqvi also said the minority affairs ministry has been working on different strategies for the welfare of Muslim community. These include protection and development of waqf properties, free those from the clutches of ‘waqf mafias’ and establishing a one-man Board of Adjudication at Central-level to deal with complaints regarding waqf properties, he said. The Board will be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge. Three-member tribunals are being established in the states. About 15 to 16 states have established these tribunals. Other states should also do this soon, he said.
“At my first meeting after assuming charge of the Ministry of Minority Affairs, I told officials that results of schemes and programmes should be visible at grass-root level. Welfare schemes should not remain on paper. They should be converted into a reality,” Naqvi said.
“Officials should visit villages to ensure benefits of welfare schemes are reaching every needy person. There is no dearth of schemes and funds for development of Muslim and other minority communities. “We only need to inform the people about these welfare measures and ‘Progress Panchayat’ is a campaign which will prove to be an effective means to achieve this purpose,” he said.
Informing people about various schemes of his ministry, like ‘Seekho aur Kamao’, ‘Nai Manzil’, ‘Nai Raushni’, ‘Ustaad’ and ‘Nai Udaan’, Naqvi said these have can guarantee empowerment of the poor belonging to minority communities. The Union Minister said various projects have been approved for Uttarakhand during 2014-15, including three degree colleges, five school buildings, two hostels, five ITIs and six health centres.
Crores of rupees has been released for various development projects under Multi-sectoral Development Programme in the state during 2015-16, he said. Under ‘Seekho Aur Kamao’ (Learn and Earn) schemes, about 2,200 people had been provided training from 2014. Under ‘Nai Raushni’ scheme, 3,300 people had been provided job-oriented training, he claimed.
Naqvi said the Minority Affairs Ministry has also taken initiative to preserve, protect and promote ancient art and culture of minority communities under ‘Ustaad’ scheme. Artisans belonging to Minority Communities from the country’s far-flung areas will display their traditional art and skills at India International Trade Fair (IITF), to be organised from November 14 at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi."

There are 61 lakh Muslim women who constitute nearly 5.5 per cent of the state’s population. From Shah Bano case in 1985 till date, Muslim women have never been heard in matters concerning their lives thanks to politics in our country. Certain patriarchal males dominated the debate on rights of Muslim women and have stonewalled attempts towards reform within the community.
In the process, Muslim women have been denied their Quranic rights as well as their rights as equal Indian citizens. Muslim countries world over such as Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and even Bangladesh and Pakistan in our neighborhood have codified personal laws governing marriage and family. Indian Muslims are denied this opportunity. As a result, we see instances of triple talaq and polygamy in our society.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Islam believes in equality, justice and compassion. We speak about a god who is merciful and beneficent.
However, there is a conservative section which is increasingly becoming influential and coming out with the most conservative interpretation of Islam. It was this mindset which stopped the entry of women at Haji Ali in Mumbai. We are fighting a legal case in this regard but it would help society at large if the government uses its clout in stopping this patriarchy that occurs in religious places. We realise issues related to Muslim Personal Law are more related with the central government. However, there is a need for the state to use its offices in ensuring reform in personal laws of communities.
In November, the Supreme Court bench of Justice Anil Dave and Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had asked the government of India whether gender discrimination suffered by Muslim women should be considered a violation of the rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution and international covenants.
BMMA has through multiple consultations involving thousands of Muslim women, lawyers, religious scholars prepared a draft Muslim Family Law based on Quranic tenets. These are in consonance with the Constitution of India. Given below are some important provisions of this draft.
> Minimum age of marriage 18 for girl and and 21 for boy.
> Minimum mehr to be equivalent of one full annual income of the groom to be paid at the time of nikaah
>Talaak-e-Ahsan to be method of divorce requiring mandatory arbitration over a 90 day period; Oral unilateral divorce to be declared illegal.
> Maintenance during marriage is the responsibility of husband even if wife has an independent source of income and as per the Muslim Women’s Protection on Divorce Act, 1986
> Polygamy to be declared illegal
We believe that as head of the state deemed as the most progressive in the country you should see merit in opposition to introduce the Uniform Civil Code without taking into account the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. Besides, every community, including Hindus would like to follow their text pertaining to kanyadaan & saptapadi provisions and therefore may not accept the new guidelines.Mumbai NewsMaharashtra: Service sector demands rollback of curbs, fears ‘irreversible damage’Mumbai Covid-19 brief: BMC restricts entry of visitors at officesBMC to conduct fire safety audit for all hospitalsClick here for more
Article 25 the Constitution gives the right to all to have personal laws based on respective tenets of different religious communities. Under this provision, we demand a gender just reform in the Muslim personal law based on Quranic values of equality and justice. The SC observation has emanated from the need to bring about a gender-just legal framework. I hope unlike the beef ban, you will not encourage Hinduisation of all laws and social practices in our state."

Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Saturday pitched for holding dialogue with Pakistan and insisted that artists from both the countries should work in cross border films to strengthen ties between the two nations. Addressing an event to mark 199th birth anniversary of founder of Aligarh Muslim University Sir Syed Ahmed Khan here, Singh accused the Centre of trying to use provision of Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to target a particular community.

He, however, said the UCC should not be brought in until there is no consensus. On the issue of triple talaq, Singh said the government has no right to interfere in personal laws of Muslims, but also suggested community members to ensure rights of women through discussions on the issue within themselves.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We can’t decide our neighbour. We must accept that Pakistan is our neighbour and work towards improving ties with it. Dialogue is the only way,” Singh said. Expressing surprise over opposition to Pakistani actors working in Bollywood film, he sought to know how they could be “troubled” after being issued visa in India. “Artists are like ambassadors. They can help improve ties. There is a need to encourage people-to-people contact to strengthen India-Pakistan tie. War is not the way,” he said.
Objecting to the NDA government’s alleged attempt to link triple talaq with Uniform Civil Code he said it can’t be “imposed” without consensus. “Our Muslim brothers too should think about rights of women in connection with triple talaq. But neither the government, nor anyone else should interfere in it. Muslims themselves should solve whatever issues are there through discussions,” he said.
The event was also attended by former Congress MP Sandip Dixit and Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Shehzad Poonawalla."

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Sunday rejected the Supreme Court’s suggestion for an out-of-court settlement of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and said that only a verdict by the apex court will be acceptable to it.
“No out-of-court settlement is acceptable to us,” AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani told reporters after a two-day meeting of the board executive.
A resolution passed by the board executive also said that “on the Babri Masjid issue, the board would only accept a decision by the Supreme Court”, making it clear that the AIMPLB is not willing to accept the Supreme Court’s suggestion.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On March 21, the apex court had suggested an out-of-court settlement of the dispute at Ayodhya, observing that issues of “religion and sentiments” can be best resolved through talks.
Chief Justice J S Khehar had even offered to mediate as a bench headed by him suggested that the parties to the dispute adopt a “give a bit and take a bit” approach for meaningful and sincere negotiations to resolve the issue.
The board also dug its heels on the contentious issue of triple talaq asserting that Muslims have the “constitutional” right to follow their personal law.
Rehmani said that the board has decided to issue a code of conduct and that those who give talaq (divorce) without ‘Sharia’ (Islamic law) reasons will face social boycott.
“A code of conduct for talaq is being issued. With its help, the real picture of Sharia directives will be brought out on the talaq issue. If talaq is given without Sharia reasons, those involved will be socially boycotted,” he said.
The board will issue appeals to maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday ‘namaz’ and emphasise on its implementation, he said. The board has made it clear that it will not tolerate interference in the Shariat laws, Rehmani said, claiming that a majority of the Muslims in the country do not want any change in their personal law.
He had earlier said that in a recent signature campaign initiated by the AIMPLB across the country, men as well as women had said that the Constitution of India guarantees them the right to practice their religion.
He urged that no “roadblocks” should be put in the implementation of the muslim personal laws. The Union government had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the triple talaq mode of divorce, ‘nikah halala’ and the practice of polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
The Ministry of Law and Justice, in its affidavit, had referred to constitutional principles like gender equality, secularism as well as international covenants, religious practices and marital laws prevalent in Islamic countries to suggest that the practice of triple talaq and polygamy needed to be adjudicated upon afresh by the apex court.
Rehmani also said the board will help women against whom talaq was misused and injustice was meted to them. The board’s women wing head, Asma Jahra said that the issue of talaq of Muslim women was not religious but social.
“In India, women’s issues are the same and in such a scenario only Muslim law should not be targeted,” she said. Jahra said that a 15,500 matters were heard on a helpline started for talaq related cases. This helpline is being run in seven languages including Hindi, Urdu and Bengali, she said.
Referring to the signature campaign conducted by the board, she said that 5.81 crore people including 2.71 crore women had voted against any change in Shariat laws adding that there were “misunderstandings on the issue”. In another key recommendation, the board said that instead of giving dowry, Muslims should give share to their daughters in their property. The board decided to use social media effectively for removing wrong conceptions about Islam and Sharia."

IUML is the second largest partner in the Congress-led United Democratic Front Opposition in Kerala. It was also a member of the UPA. Opposition parties had alleged that government delayed the announcement of the death of Ahmed to facilitate the presentation of the union budget on February 1. Talking to reporters after the meeting, IUML supremo Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal alleged that the Centre had exhibited an inhuman attitude after Ahamed’s death.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Party will organise protest conventions in all districts on February 11”, he said. IUML expressed gratitude to AICC Chief Sonia Gandhi and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for being present at RML Hospital, where Ahamed was taken after he collapsed in Parliament on February 1.
IUML National treasurer P K Kunhalikutty said Sonia Gandhi spent about two and half hours at the hospital to enquire about Ahamed. “It is an expression of solidarity and the party will not forget that”, he said adding it also reflected the face of compassion at a time when government neglected.
Kunhalikutty refused to to drawn into the issue of triple talaq and said the recent statement of Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on the matter was with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh polls. “We are not taking the bait”, he said, adding that BJP’s aim was communal polarisation and nothing else. Thangal also said IUML did not discuss the issue of candidature for the Malappuram Lok Sabha segment which fell vacant following the death of Ahmed. “Let the notification come”, he added."

Partha Paul
Muslim leaders on Tuesday launched a fresh attack on both the central and state governments over several issues in a public meeting of imams and muezzins at Rani Rashmoni Avenue here. Md Kamruzzaman, general secretary of All Bengal Minority Youth Federation – which organised the event attended by over 40 Muslim organisations – said the present BJP government was intervening with Muslim Personal Law. Three TMC MPs – Sultan Ahmed, Idris Ali and Ahmed Hassan Imran – were also present on stage.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised ‘achhe din’, but does that mean taking away the right to practice the religion of one’s choice or to dictate what one will eat or wear?” Kamruzzaman asked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Referring to the proposed BJP rally against triple talaq on November 18, when the three-day convention of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) would begin, he said: “The BJP in order to disrupt the function of the AIMPLB has organised a rally on November 18, but we are also ready to counter any attempts by the BJP. I urge all Muslims to maintain peace, but if they intend to create trouble, we are also ready to fight back.”
Kamruzzaman said the state government had been kind enough to start honorariums for Muslim clerics, but this had been stuck at Rs 2,500 for imams and Rs 1,000 for muezzins every month for the last five-and-a-half years.
“The state should find ways to generate revenue from the wakf property, and it should revise the imams’ and muezzins’ pay. It should be at least Rs 10,000 for the imams and Rs 6,000 for muezzins as they have it in New Delhi. Besides, there should be provision for housing imams and educating their children, as Mamata had promised before she became the chief minister,” Kamruzzaman added.

While Qari Fazlur Rahman, the imam who leads the Red Road congregation of Muslims on Eid and Bakri Eid also said the demand of the imams were justified, MPs have skirted the issue of the hike in honourarium, and spoke about the intervention of the Centre with Muslim Personal Law.
“It is a testing time for Muslims, and they should be careful not to walk into the trap. The prime minister is raising these communal issues knowing fully well that Muslim law would not be altered. He is doing it to divert the attention of people from other issues – The unfulfilled promises of bringing in black money into the country, being unable to trace missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed and the fake encounter of eight undertrials in Bhopal,” Imran said.
He also said the chief minister opposed encroachment into any religious law.
“She had said that no one should be forced to follow any norm which is against his or her religious rules. If it is the Muslim Shariya, let the Muslims decide what they want,” he said.
Ali said BJP leaders had lost their minds, and that Narendra Modi would never be successful in imposing a uniform civil code in the country. Sultan Ahmed added that a unified fight by different parties would be required to defeat Narendra Modi.
“The Muslims would not be able to fight the rising communal forces in the country. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar should come together with Mamata Banerjee to fight against BJP at the Centre,” Ahmed said.
He however, added that imams and muezzins had every right to demand a hike in their honourariums, and that he would pass the message to the right quarters."
"1617716942-11","https://indianexpress.com/page/124/?s=Triple+talaq","Say talaq to triple talaq","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/say-talaq-to-triple-talaq/","Say talaq to triple talaq","November 15, 2000","It is often claimed that the Shariat (Islamic law) permeates almost every branch of Islamic literature, that it is the epitome of the true Islamic spirit, the most decisive expression of Islamic thought, the essential kernel of Islam. Consequently, it has been argued that any legislative change in the Muslim personal law would violate the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution. The argument is contested, but the All-India Personal Law Board (AIPLB) failed to take an explicit stand at their recent meeting in Bangalore. It is no longer possible to keep deferring an issue that is not only affecting Muslim women but is also so central to their future welfare and security.
Already, demands for judicial activism and pressure are mounting from some Muslim women organisations to amend the laws relating to `triple talaq’. Time and again precedents from other Muslim countries, including Pakistan, are cited to clamour for some measure of reform in the Muslim personal law. Members of the AIPBL would do well to pay heed to the imperious call of changing pattern of modern life, and the necessity of attempting a larger synthesis after the manner of the various forward-looking movements of Islam; this is a process which is not the dead and immobile one that superficial observers of Islamic history have usually taken it to be.
Islam persists, not through rigid negation of the forces of changing environments and new epochs or fresh historical and social impacts but through the adaptation to these conditions. And the fact that Islam has survived the endless vicissitudes of history conclusively proves that it adapted itself from age to age and epoch to epoch to the changing outer conditions. ""Do not put to me too many unnecessary questions"", the Prophet is reported to have said. ""Whoever does it is an enemy of the Muslims because the answers given would become binding on them and thereby the liberty of action would be curtailed"". Maybe, this is what inspired poet-philosopher Mohammad Iqbal to state that the claim of his generation to reinterpret the fundamental legal principles, in the light of their own experience and the altered conditions of modern life, was justified.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Today, the contentious issue is not the preservation of `Muslim identity’, expressed through mosques, religious institutions, the traditional system of education and charitable institutions. There is an overall consensus, despite the spurt in majoritarian stridency, on guarding minority rights provided by the Constitution. Nor is the sanctity of the Shariat in question, though the 14th century historian Ziauddin Barani, representing Muslim orthodoxy, had conceded that the Sultan was empowered to enact state laws (zawabit) even if in extreme cases they had to override the Shariat. Likewise, Ferishta observed two centuries later that it was not possible to rule Hindustan in accordance with the Shariat. At the heart of the present debate, so argued the Deoband-educated Maulana Said Ahmad Akbarabadi in the 1960s, is the distinction between those Quranic injunctions that were specific to the Arab customary law of the time and those applicable to Muslim societies in other times. This distinction has been made inthe past, and that alone enabled Islam to pass through many stages of reorientation and readjustments. The scholar of Islamic jurisprudence, A.A.A. Fyzee, positioned himself against the traditional belief that in Islam law and religion are coterminous. He argued that law is a product of social evolution and it must change with time and circumstances.
In the past, the AIMPLB has not been impressed with these arguments; I doubt if they think differently now or are sensitive to the powerful and successful reformist initiatives in Muslim societies. They may settle, in response to certain court judgements, for a few cosmetic changes without satisfying the growing and persistent demands for gender justice for Muslim women. Perhaps, the only way out is to ask for a referendum or bring about some form of consensus (ijma, the most important legal notion in Islam) not on the enforcement of a uniform civil code but on substantial reforms in the provisions on `triple talaq’ and maintenance for the Muslim widows.
Doubtless, this is a limited agenda, and yet the urge for reforms must come from the community itself. One hopes that patience, persistence and education will lead to a reappraisal of existing attitudes and that more and more educated Muslims will take recourse to ijtehad (exercise of independent judgement), defined by Iqbal as ""the principle of movement"" in Islam. Who knows, some day a version of the Mutazalites (in Baghdad) may strike a favourable chord? In the 9th century, they championed reason as judge in matters of belief. According to them, the inner meaning of scriptures could be ascertained only by reason. In its historical sequence, the existing debates, though clouded by fresh controversies after the Shah Bano judgement, owe their origin to the discussions in the Constituent Assembly and Jawaharlal Nehru’s subsequent ambivalence in deciding whether or not to provide equality before the law for all Indian women. He may have been right in thinking that the time was not ripe for bringing Muslimswithin the preview of a uniform civil code, but the initiative on such matters should have rested with Parliament and not the religious traditionalists and the defenders of the status quo.
Not many people know that Nehru’s Cabinet received suggestions, in 1961, for reviewing and reforming the Muslim personal law. Nehru was himself enthusiastic, pointedly mentioning the changes that had taken place in Tunisia, Egypt and Pakistan. Lengthy discussions followed, and the Law ministry was asked to make appropriate recommendations. But the mere hint of an inquiry in the ministry’s report led to a public outcry. A gathering of Muslim ministers and MPs, chaired by Zakir Husain, the vice-president of the Republic, echoed their sentiments without any serious deliberation.
No government after Nehru could contemplate reforms to ensure the equal status of Muslim women. Electorally, the risk was too great. In consequence, state intervention in the Shah Bano case came about with an eye on the ""Muslim vote"" and to defend a traditionalist interpretation of the Shariat, which was untenable in most Muslim societies. This is because the political regime, acting in unison with the Muslim orthodoxy, had legitimised the AIMPLB members as the sole custodians, interpreters and transmitter of the Shariat. Nonetheless, let us hope that the eclectic spirit of the Prophet’s message is not throttled, its theology not gagged by history and its vitality not sapped by totalitarianism. In the words of Fyzee, there is a strong case for releasing the spirit of compassion, fraternity, tolerance and reasonableness."

However, the board is not in favour of a uniform civil code, she clarified.
“Quran says there must be time for reconciliation between partners. It says when a man gives talaq he must pause and consult his wife. Otherwise, triple talaq is like a hanging dagger for Muslim women,” she said.
AIMWPLB has also sought a ban on “Nikah Halala”, where a woman who has been divorced through triple talaq has to marry another man and consummate her marriage with him before being eligible to remarry her ex-husband.

Personal law reform has always been an extremely sensitive issue as the trajectory of the Shah Bano case has demonstrated. Given the contentious history of court-directed personal law reform in this country, reform initiatives from within the community are always welcome. However, they have always been extremely timorous and the AISPLB’s new nikahnama is no exception.
Over the years, regressive social practices have nullified even the more progressive aspects of community law. Take the idea of marriage being regarded as contract and a relationship between equals within Islam. How can such a concept be sustained in a society where women are routinely married when they are still minors and when they are more likely than not to be illiterate or very poorly educated? Studies have shown that the average age of marriage of Muslim women in India is a little over 15.6 years — far lower, incidentally, than the all-India average. When a teenager enters into marriage, what personal agency can she be expected to have? Then take the practice of ‘triple talaq’. While the All India Muslim Personal Law Board recognises it as a regressive practice and advises Muslim men to desist from taking recourse to it, there has been no attempt to ban it outright. Again, it is the poor and illiterate women within the community who have had to contend with the adverse consequences of ‘triple talaq’.
Given this reality, it becomes crucial to situate personal law reform within the broader rubric of women’s status. The salutary effects of legal reform can only be realised if Muslim women as a whole are able to exercise their choices within the community. Hopefully the recent data, generated by the Sachar Committee Report among other agencies, on the status of Muslim women will help initiate some debate on this crucial issue within the community."

(Source: PTI Photo)
THE BJP released its manifesto for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls on Saturday, promising to set up a department in every district to prevent “exodus” due to communal tension, to explore legal possibilities for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, to ensure that 90 per cent jobs in every industry in UP were reserved for youths of the state, and to waive off loans of small and marginal farmers.

Releasing the manifesto called ‘Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra (Pledge for People’s Welfare) — 2017’, BJP president Amit Shah said that if it came to power, the party would release a white paper on “exodus” due to communal tension in the state, including “from western Uttar Pradesh and Kairana”, claiming that police stations in the state don’t register FIRs on such complaints.
Calling the UP law and order “the worst in the country”, Shah said a BJP government would take steps immediately to improve the situation, especially for women’s safety. The manifesto promises jobs for youths and welfare measures for farmers. Going further than the Samajwadi Party’s offer of free laptops to meritorious students, it talks of laptops for youngsters joining college plus “free 1 GB Internet data per month” under a ‘Swami Vivekanand Yuva Internet Yojana’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The party says it would take up the ‘triple talaq’ issue, pending in the Supreme Court, “going by the opinion of the Muslim women in the state”.
The law and order section of the manifesto refers to “exodus” due to communal tension and says a government led by it would set up a special department led by the deputy collector in every district to ensure this doesn’t happen, especially in western UP. The district collector would be held accountable in case of any exodus, the manifesto says.
In another promise that BJP leaders said concerns western UP, the manifesto says a party government would shut down all illegal slaughter-houses as well as ban mechanical slaughter-houses. Calling it a “big issue in western UP”, BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan, who belongs to Meerut, said that “unlimited animals” are slaughtered in mechanical slaughter-houses. “That decreases the number of cattle, which affects the farming sector. Also, the slaughter of animals in large numbers causes water pollution as such slaughter-houses do not have arrangements for treatment of blood waste before discharge. Also, people steal cattles for mechanical slaughter-houses.”
The party promises a special police law and order wing as well as an anti-land mafia task force and another to probe corruption cases of the past 15 years, and says it will fill up police vacancies without bias for any particular caste or religion. Six forensic science labs feature among its promises.
For women empowerment and their security, the BJP promises three new women police battalions, as well as a ‘Bhagya Laxmi Yojana’. This scheme would have a ‘Vikas Bond’ of Rs 50,000 for every girl child born to a poor family, plus other benefits.
For youths, the manifesto talks about creating 70 lakh jobs and self-employment opportunities in five years, as well as a start-up venture capital fund of Rs 1,000 crore to make them self-reliant.
The party makes a special mention of lawyers, promising that the financial assistance to their families after their deaths would be increased to Rs 70 lakh and that young lawyers would be given Rs 5,000 per year for three years to purchase required books and periodicals.
The manifesto offers free education up to graduation for girls under the ‘Ahilyabai Kanya Free Education Scheme’, and for boys up to Class 12. Boys scoring more than 50 per cent in Class 12 would also get free graduation, the manifesto says. Besides, the BJP promises a ‘Baba Saheb Ambedkar Scholarship Fund’, of Rs 500 crore, to help poor students. There would be other schemes for SC/ST students as per the manifesto.
There is a promise of cards for the poor to get benefits of government schemes as well as a ‘Samanya Nirdhan Varg Ayog’ to make them more self-reliant. A ‘Rs 20,000-crore Chief Minister Krishi Sinchai Fund’ would help improve irrigation and a ‘Matsya Palak Kalyan Fund’ of Rs 100 crore would promote fisheries.
Free electricity and LPG connections have been promised to all poor families, as well as 24-hour power supply to all. A ‘Shabti Sankalp Abhiyan’ would free the state of malnutrition in five years, says the party.
A ‘Chandrashekhar Azad Gramin Vikas Sachivalaya’ would come up in every four panchayats to provide people benefits of government schemes, the party says. Separately, there would be a Bundelkhand Development Board and a Poorvanchal Development Board.
A ‘Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana’ with funds of Rs 1,000 crore, it says, would help self-employed people like carpenters, barbers, potters and others, while a BJP government would bear the expense of religious tours by senior citizens.
There would be a ‘Kabir Academy’ to promote regional languages, a ‘Shaheed Roshan Singh Residential Township’ for families of policemen in major cities, and an ‘Eklavya Kreeda Kosh’ of Rs 500 crore to revive existing sports colleges.
Apart from this, in a BJP government, all government employees and their family members would be given free medical insurance up to Rs 2 lakh."

In a first for Jaipur and probably the state, the city’s Jama Masjid has made special arrangements for women to offer namaz at a separate section created inside the mosque.
“Women, who were usually out for shopping in this area, used to come and offer prayers at the mosque. Women have always been allowed to pray at mosques since they couldn’t go back home in time to offer prayers. Hence, we created a designated place within the mosque for them to offer prayers,” said Naim Qureshi, chief of Jaipur Jama Masjid committee, the largest mosque in Jaipur.
Though they are allowed, women rarely pray at the mosques. Jama Masjid in the city is among those few mosques where women pray occasionally. Situated in the old city market of Johri Bazaar, a tourist attraction, the mosque also sees a few tourists who stop by to pray.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The designated place is located on the mosque’s first floor. A small portion in the south-west corner of the main hall has been separated with glass partition and curtains for purdah.
“For ablution, there was a common hauz (place for ablution) on the ground floor. So we created another hauz for women in their designated place on the main floor above it,” Qureshi said, adding that “it does not violate Islamic jurisprudence”.
Javed Hyatt, another committee member, said, “Earlier, there was a concern for purdah. Now any woman can draw the curtains, perform ablution, and then pray.”

Welcoming the move, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali said: “It is certainly a welcome step, but it (women offering prayers in mosques) should not be made into a habit. Men are encouraged to offer prayers at mosques as it translates into sawab (reward in the context of Islam), while women are supposed to offer prayers at home. It is more convenient for them and the family.”
Nishat Husain, chief of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), termed the move “historic”.
“Doors to God are open for everyone but in a male centric society, the men have appropriated darghas and mosques. This move is certainly historic for, for a change, they have thought about women and their entry in mosques.” All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) chief Shaista Ambar, too said that she is “happy” over the news. In 1997, Ambar had set up the only such mosque in Lucknow, and perhaps in Uttar Pradesh, where both men and women offered prayers.
“Clerics often generalise and say that Muslim women are ignorant. I keep telling them that they have always kept the women away from various forums, and from including them in discussions about deen (faith). I have always felt that women should be allowed to freely pray and hear the taqreer (religious speech) at mosques, this will bring them closer to knowing their rights; and in turn, they will be able to educate their children in a better way and ultimately uplift the society.”
Recently, two Jaipur women had underwent a training course for qazis in Mumbai, backed by BMMA, making them perhaps the first women qazis in the state. However, the clerics had opposed the move and termed any possible marriages administered by them as automatically invalid.Jaipur NewsRajasthan: In video, BJP rebel candidate says withdrew nomination under pressurePolice officer accused of demanding sexual favours from rape survivor dismissed from service88 new colleges opened in past two years but over 35 per cent teaching posts vacant: DataClick here for more

In a shocking incident, a woman has lodged a complaint against her husband who allegedly threatened her with triple talaq, after she gave birth to a girl child. The woman alleged before the police that her husband threatened her to give triple talaq soon. He was also about to marry another woman, after the birth of the girl child, said the woman in her complaint.
“I got married four years ago and after eight months of my marriage I came back home. They used to beat and harass me for dowry every day. They even tried killing me many a times. The situation became worst when, I gave birth to a girl baby. They didn’t want to accept me nor the child and currently now my husband wants to get married again. I want our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minisiter Yogi Adityanath to abolish triple talaq soon,” said victim.
In his ‘Mann ki Baat’, last Sunday, Prime Minister Modi dubbed triple talaq as a “bad social practice”, saying, such practices can be ended by social awakening.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also stressed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not want a conflict in the society for this.
Meanwhile, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has issued appeals to all maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday ‘namaz’ and emphasise on its implementation.
The Board has made it clear that it will not tolerate any interference in the Shariat laws, and claimed that majority of the Muslims in the country do not want any change in their personal law.
Earlier this week, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called for an end to the practice of triple talaq and invoked the disrobing of Draupadi in the Mahabharata to emphasise his point."

Hitting out at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for his letter to the Law Commission expressing his government’s inability to form an opinion on Uniform Civil Code (UCC), senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi today accused him of “giving in to hardliners in the minority community”. “It is obvious that Nitish Kumar has refrained from giving a clear opinion on raging issues such as the UCC, ‘triple talaq’ and polygamy due to the fear of hardliners in the minority community,” he said in a statement.

Alleging “inconsistency” in Kumar’s stand on empowerment of women, Modi said while the chief minister repeatedly claimed that he enforced prohibition in the state at the prodding of women, he “hesitated in taking a stand” on UCC, ‘triple talaq’ and polygamy, lest it infuriated the “maulvis”.
“If prohibition can be enforced unilaterally at the prodding of women, why will social vices such as ‘triple talaq’ and polygamy be fought after taking the nod of the maulvis?,” he asked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also reminded the chief minister of his stand that the imposition of prohibition was consistent with the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution and asserted that UCC and cow-slaughter too came under the same Constitutional guidelines.
He wondered why Kumar was “meekly submitting to the dictates of the maulvis” when it came to taking a stand on UCC and ‘triple talaq’.
The BJP leader charged the chief minister with “letting down” lakhs of Muslim women, divorced by their husbands by invoking ‘triple talaq’, by not taking a stand and asked him whether the country should be guided by the Constitution or “dictates of ulemas and maulvis”."

Raising the issue of ‘triple talaq’ at the BJP National Executive Meet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that justice should be done to Muslim women, according to Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. Modi also said that if there are social evils, the society should be woken up and efforts made to provide justice to the victims.
“He (Modi) talked about social justice. He said our Muslim sisters should also get justice. Injustice should not be done with them. Nobody should be exploited. We do not want that there is conflict within the Muslim community over this issue. What we have to do is that if there are any social evils, we have to wake up the society and make efforts to provide justice to them (Muslim women). That was the Prime Minister’s spirit,” Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said while briefing reporters.

Tearing into the Opposition for accusing BJP of tampering with the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in recent polls, Modi said they are trying to churn up rows particularly ahead of the MCD polls. “Opposition is concoction new issues in a factory of some kind. During Delhi Elections, Church attacks were the highlights and during the Bihar Polls ‘Award Wapasi’ was the issue. And right now it is the EVM,” the Prime Minister said during the meeting.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also called on the BJP leaders to maintain caution while making statements and not get carried away with emotions and make untoward remarks. “If there are any complaints, then the matter should be passed on to the party leaders who will convey it to me,” he said.
The Prime Minister also called on the BJP to not get too excited over the recent State Assembly Elections victory and ensure they keep the momentum going. “The BJP will launch a special campaign for those 120 Lok Sabha seats which have been out of our reach,” he added. The Prime Minister also hailed the efforts of Party President Amit Shah saying that he was the ideal model of an able strategist."

The elevation of Rahul Gandhi is likely to be delayed as the Congress top brass is expected to further defer the process of organisational polls, which had been postponed earlier by a year till this December-end. A meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the top decision-making body of the party, tomorrow is unlikely to take a decision on the elevation of Rahul Gandhi, with a section within the party feeling that this should be done after the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
WATCH VIDEO: Here’s What Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi Said At CWC Meet

Party sources say the organisational elections are to be deferred by more than a year as there is very little time to hold the polls and the party has to focus on the upcoming assembly elections due early next year. Many in the party are, however, divided on the timing of Rahuls elevation and want it to be deferred till the upcoming assembly polls. Some party leaders, however, also feel that in view of the current situation Sonia Gandhi should continue to steer the party and not take a back seat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The current political situation is expected to be discussed at the CWC, including the one-day ban on NDTV which has created uproar in the opposition as also in the media. The meeting is significant as the Winter Session of Parliament is starting from November 16 and the Congress will finalise its strategy for the session at this meeting.
The Congress is seeking to corner the government on several issues including on the issue of freedom of speech and expression in the wake of the NDTV day-long ban. The organisational elections in Congress are overdue and the party had sought time from the Election Commission to complete the process by December 31. The party had informed the poll panel about it as required under the rules.

Besides the organisational polls and the strategy to be adopted for Parliament session, the meeting would also take stock of the current political situation and discuss its plans for assembly elections to some states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab due next year, party sources said.
Among several political issues that the government seeks to raise during the Session in order to corner the BJP include making political gains out of the surgical strikes, killing of eight Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) activists in an “encounter” in Madhya Pradesh and contentious issues like the triple talaq and uniform civil code being raked up.
The CWC meeting comes at a time when many feel Congress President Sonia Gandhi should hand over the mantle to her son as she is suffering from ill health, especially after her roadshow in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency of Varanasi on August 2 when she was hospitalised."

Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday questioned the silence of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad on the Allahabad High Court’s observation that “triple talaq is cruelty against Muslim women”. He also said that his party is on board with the court’s observations.

“It is baffling that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad have chosen to maintain stoic silence on the raging issue of triple talaq for the sake of vote bank politics,” Modi alleged.
Asking Kumar if he had taken consent of the male population before granting 50 percent reservation to women in the state’s panchayats, he said if not, why wasn’t he supporting Muslim women in their crusade against the menace which was opposed by 90 percent of them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Claiming inconsistency in the chief minister’s stand on empowerment of women, the BJP leader accused him of not backing Muslim women in their fight against triple talaq and polygamy for the sake of vote bank politics. He claimed this amounted to leaving the fate of women in the hands of hardliners of the minority community.
Modi also reminded Kumar that he had imposed prohibition in the state on the demand of women at a function last year. “If you can impose prohibition in Bihar on the call of a few women, why don’t you muster courage to oppose triple talaq?” he said.
Reformist measures were not implemented after taking consent of those opposing it and if it was so, the practise of ‘Sati’ would not have been done away with, he added.
Stating that the Allahabad High Court has observed that Muslim Personal Law was not above right to equality and fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, Modi asked the ruling grand alliance leaders to clarify their stand on triple talaq."

“There are over two dozen areas, where it (exodus) is clearly visible. Population imbalance is a reality there and that cannot be ignored,” he said.
On the issues mentioned in the BJP manifesto, including exodus and triple talaq, Adityanath said BJP used to highlight issues related to people and will continue to do so.
On the triple talaq issue, he said, “It is necessary for protecting the interest of women for their empowerment. If any part of the body is weak, the body cannot remain strong.”"

WHAT ELSE IS MAKING NEWS:

The Winter Session, which normally convenes from the third or fourth week of November, has been advanced to November 16 this time, for early passage of Central GST (CGST) and Integrated GST (IGST) legislations, which will pave way for the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The issues of army’s surgical strikes and allegations by some parties that the government was trying to politicise it and step to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are set to in limelight during the session. The government is also considering advancing the Budget Session by a month or so starting from January next year.
Sources in the government said besides legislations relating to GST, nearly 15 new bills are likely to be introduced. The government would also push for passage of the ordinance which seeks to amend the Enemy Property Act. In December, the Centre had for the fourth time promulgated the ordinance to amend the nearly 50-year-old Enemy Property law to guard against claims of succession or transfer of properties left by people who migrated to Pakistan after wars."

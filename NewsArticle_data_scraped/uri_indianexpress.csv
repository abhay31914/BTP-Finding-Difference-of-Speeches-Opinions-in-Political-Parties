China hopes that both the countries could properly deal with their differences dialogue and consultant and improve their bilateral relationship, strengthen cooperation in different fields and work jointly for regional peace and development and stability,” he said."

Amid increased tension along the border in the wake of the recent terror attack on an Army camp in Uri, the Border Security Force on Friday arrested a Pakistani terrorist while he was trying to cross over to the Indian side at Pargwal in Akhnoor sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Identified as Abdul Qayoom, a resident of Sialkote district, he is being seen as a prized catch by BSF as the arrest can add to the evidence of terror attacks against India coming from Pakistani soil. The arrest has come less than a week after the Uri attack in which 18 soldiers died.

He was leading a group of four terrorists who would have followed him after he crossed over to the Indian side, sources said. However, while passing through the fence around 4 am, he got entangled in the concertina wire and was apprehended by the BSF troops, sources said, adding that the other terrorists fled back to Pakistan side.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While police are yet to receive custody of the terrorist from the BSF, sources said that Qayoom appears to be a hardened terrorist and had been closely associated with Hafiz Saeed, founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. A mobile phone, along with two SIM cards, has been seized from his possession, they said, adding that further questioning was in progress.
“He has been frequently changing statements to mislead the security agencies,” said D K Upadhyaya, BSF Inspector General for Jammu zone. “We had encircled him as he touched the fence and kept waiting for others who may have followed him. As no one followed him for some time, we apprehended him.”
“He appears to be an educated person and speaks in English,’’ Upadhyaya said, adding that Qayoom does not appear to have entered Indian territory inadvertently.

Security forces are on high alert after terror attacks at Poonch and Uri."

BSP chief Mayawati Friday congratulated the Army for “its successful surgical strikes inside Pakistan and keeping its promise made to the people after Uri attack”, but said the government’s permission for such strikes should have come soon after the Pathankot terror attack in January.
“By demolishing terror camps in LoC, the Army has fulfilled the promise made by it to the people of the country after the Uri attack,” Mayawati said in a statement here.

“Giving a go-ahead for Army action by the Modi government is a right but late move. It should have been done soon after the Pathankot attack in January this year. Perhaps it could have saved the lives of 19 jawans in Uri,” she added."

The Uri trailer, featuring Vicky Kaushal, Yami Gautam and Paresh Rawal, is out. After watching the two and a half minute long trailer, it seems Bollywood has a promising military drama to offer after a long time. Director and writer Aditya Dhar has a gripping tale to tell with this Ronnie Screwvala production.
The trailer opens with the backgrounder of the story. It says, “On 18 September 2016, 19 unarmed Indian soldiers were martyred at Uri base came, Kashmir.” Determined to take revenge for the “deadliest attack in two decades”, Vicky Kaushal who plays the role of an army officer Vihaan Singh Shergill takes a pledge to destroy the enemies and bring home all his soldiers safely. Next, we meet Paresh Rawal, who is seen suggesting a surgical strike to his seniors.
In response to the attack by Pakistani terrorists, on September 29, 2016, the Indian Army’s Special Forces carried out “surgical strikes” on terror launch pads across Line of Control (LoC). The official synopsis of the movie reads, “A defining moment in India’s military history. A moment that paved a path to a new, stronger India. Presenting URI.”

Yami Gautam essays the role of an intelligence officer. She looks convincing as she interrogates a terrorist about the Uri attack. But the one who steals the thunder is Kaushal. His dialogue delivery and the army man like passion in his eyes to go to any extent for his country is what makes Uri a film worth the wait. As he utters, “We will get our revenge for the blood loss with blood,” and “Indian army didn’t start this war, but we will bloody hell finish it,” you are reminded of Sunny Deol from JP Dutta’s Border. What adds to the feeling of the trailer is Shashwat Sachdev’s background score.

(Screen grab)
In his United Nations General Assembly speech on Wednesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif urged “serious and sustained” dialogue with India and at the same time, brought up the Kashmir issue, glorifying the slain Hizbul commander Burhan Wani.
Sharif devoted much of his 20-minute speech at the UN General Assembly session to Kashmir and the current situation in the Valley and said Pakistan “fully supports the demand of the Kashmiri people for self-determination”.
He also stated that Pakistan itself had been a victim of externally sponsored terrorism and that he will not allow it to destabilise the nation. “My country has been the principal victim of terrorism including that supported, sponsored and financed from abroad,” he said. He also elaborated on the ways through which Pakistan is combating terrorism.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While the Indian leaders reacted to his speech at home, the Indian envoy to the UN Eenam Gambhir raised a storm by giving a short and crisp reply to the Pakistani prime minister’s speech.
Gambhir decried Pakistan’s claim on terrorism by stating that India and others have been privy to the consequences of Pakistan’s policy of sponsoring terrorism. “What my country and our other neighbours are facing today is Pakistan’s long-standing policy of sponsoring terrorism, the consequences of which have spread well beyond our region,” she said.
She substantiated this by citing 9/11 World Trade Center attacks in New York, the worst terrorist attack in the history of the US, which was avenged by the US forces by killing Osama Bin Laden in 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

 
“The world has not yet forgotten that the trail of that dastardly attack led all the way to Abbottabad in Pakistan,” she stated.
Calling the contents of Sharif’s speech “hypocritical sermons”, Gambhir raised the recent Uri attack, which left 17 soldiers dead and which was also pointedly not mentioned in Nawaz Sharif’s speech.
Eenam, sharpening her attack, said, “Shortly before Pakistan gave its hypocritical sermons in this august house today, its envoy in New Delhi was summoned in the context of the most recent of the terror attacks in Uri that claimed 18 Indian lives. That terrorist attack is part of a trail of continuous flow of terrorists trained and armed by our neighbour and tasked to carry out terrorist attacks in my country.”
She then reiterated how Pakistan used funds, including those received form international aid, to train and support terrorists. Addressing the reference to Burhan Wani as a ‘young leader’ by Sharif, the UN envoy said this reference further substantiates Pakistan’s support for terrorist organisations in the country.
With a slanting reference to Sharif’s tirade against Kashmir and the ongoing unrest, Gambhir delineated how “Pakistan is a country with a democracy deficit” and how they practiced terrorism on their own citizens.
“..it practices terrorism on its own people. It extends support to extremist groups, it suppresses minorities and women and denies basic human rights including through draconian laws. As a democracy India is firmly resolved to protect all our citizens from all acts of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. We cannot and will not allow terrorism to prevail,” she said.

She ended her speech by commenting on Pakistan’s promises on peace and restraint and how they were bound to be broken and the international community betrayed.
“Finally, Mr President, we have heard Pakistan, whose nuclear proliferation record is marked by deception and deceit, talking about restraint, renunciation and peace. Similar false promises it has made to us – the international community – on terrorism. Perhaps renunciation of lies and self-restraint on threats could be a good place for Pakistan to start,” Eenam concluded."

The ICJ’s verdict, granting consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav and directing Islamabad to review and reconsider his conviction and sentencing, is being perceived as a major diplomatic and legal success for India, which has consistently tried to isolate Pakistan on the global stage over the last few years.
In reality, Pakistan has to only grant consular access and can conduct “review and reconsideration” at its “choosing” — this, in effect, puts off Jadhav’s execution for the time being.
READ |  ICJ verdict in Kulbhushan Jadhav case: Key points
But the ICJ verdict needs to be seen in the context of a string of India’s diplomatic successes in the last few years — a culmination of the painstaking diplomatic and legal groundwork to isolate Pakistan.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The most recent was the listing of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on May 1, after Beijing lifted its technical hold. China had consistently blocked India’s bid to get Azhar designated by the UNSC Resolution 1267 sanctions committee. While Azhar has been accused of several terrorist attacks — from the Parliament attack in 2001 to the Pulwama attack in February 2019 — China repeatedly blocked the listing efforts over the last decade, at Pakistan’s behest. It was only after India built international pressure, and made diplomatic maneuvres with the US doing the heavylifting and a series of quid pro quos, that it managed a win.

India’s attempt over the last two years to first “greylist” Pakistan, and then build pressure to “blacklist” Pakistan at the Financial Action Task Force, also seems to have worked. This created pressure on Islamabad — including from Beijing, its all-weather ally — to take action against Saeed.

New Delhi also scored a major win after the Pulwama attack in February this year, when it got the UNSC to issue a statement condemning the attack. It was the first time that the UNSC condemned a terrorist attack on security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir, and named the Pakistan-based terrorist group JeM. What was equally important was that China also signed the statement, despite it being an “iron brother” of Pakistan.

India also got diplomatic support from the US after the Pulwama attack, as Washington supported New Delhi’s right to defend itself. And after the Balakot airstrikes deep inside Pakistan, India got a chorus of support from the international community. The release of IAF fighter pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was a case in point, where Delhi’s pressure seemed to have worked.

The surgical strikes across the LoC were precise and conducted at frenetic pace but the major, who led the daredevil mission, said that the return was the most difficult part and bullets fired by the enemy soldiers were so close that these were whistling past the ears. The Army Major speaks about the stunning mission in a new book being brought out on the first anniversary of surgical strikes in Pakistan occupied Kashmir.
The officer is referred to as Major Mike Tango in the book, titled “India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes”. The Army had decided to use soldiers from the units that had suffered losses in the Uri attack for the elaborate revenge mission.
A Ghatak platoon was formed and soldiers from the two units that had lost men were roped in to man border posts and provide crucial terrain intelligence and support to the mission that lay ahead. “Tactically, this was a smart move – few knew the lay of the frontier land better than they did. But there was another astute reason. “Involving them in the mission would at least begin to lay the ghosts of Uri to rest,” says the book.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
About the details of the planning, it says, “The target list was scrutinised along a top-secret chain of command that numbered barely a handful of people, with ‘need to know’ rules applicable throughout. “The options were vetted by designated officers from the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing, before a final recommended brief was presented to the government.”
Maj. Tango was entrusted with the job of leading the operation to carry out the strikes. “As team Leader, Maj. Tango had chosen every man himself, including the officers and men who would play a supporting role. He was also acutely aware of the fact that the lives of 19 men were, quite literally, in his hands,” the book says.
Though Maj. Tango chose the best men for the job, one thing was bothering him – the de-induction or the return. “That’s where I knew I could lose guys,” the book quotes him as recalling. “Even the actual attack was not something that flustered the commandos. It was the return, an uphill trek to the LoC that was the truly daunting part.
“Their backs would be facing a blaze of fire from Pakistan Army posts, belatedly roused from their slumber. And the dominant position held by the posts would make the escaping warriors easy targets to spot and kill,” the book says. A total of four terror launch pads operated by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and protected by the Pakistan Army were selected.
“Through a series of masked communications over mobile, Maj. Tango’s men contacted four ‘assets’- two local villagers in PoK and two Pakistani nationals operating in the area -both moles in the dreaded Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group, men who had been turned by Indian agencies a few years before.
“All the four assets separately confirmed the target information that was placed before them. In terms of intelligence, there was nothing further for the team to do on this side of the LoC,” the book says.
The book, written by Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh and published by Penguin India, tells 14 true stories of extraordinary courage and fearlessness, providing a glimpse into the kind of heroism India’s soldiers display in unthinkably hostile conditions and under grave provocation.
The mission was brief – the soldiers were expected to reach their targets, study the latest intelligence they could possibly access with their satellite devices and then proceed to wipe out every man they saw there, the book says.
The weapons and equipment were then finalised.
“Maj. Tango would be armed with his M4A1 5.56-mm carbine, the rest of the assault team with a mix of M4A1s and standard-issue Israeli Tavor TAR-21 assault rifles, Instalaza C90 disposable grenade launchers and Galil sniper rifles. Batteries on night-vision equipment were checked and other devices were charged too,” the book says.
Two of the terror launch pads identified as targets for Maj. Tango’s team were well inside PoK and roughly 500 metres away from each other, it says.
“Each launch pad is really a transit staging area for terrorist infiltrators before they are sent across the LoC. Both launch pads were close to Pakistan Army posts for logistical and administrative purposes. ISI handlers would often visit these launch pads before infiltration attempts,” according the book.
“From the moment the firefight began until the last bullet was fired, it had been just over an hour. The frenetic pace of the assault meant the teams, now united after the split attack on two launch pads, would prepare to leave with only a very rough estimate of the number of terrorists they had managed to kill: 20. The figure would be corroborated days later by India’s external intelligence.
“A total of 38-40 terrorists and two Pakistan Army personnel were killed at the four targets. The three separate teams had simultaneously struck 4 launch pads across the LoC. Their entry into PoK had been coordinated and precisely timed,” it says.
As for the return, the major decided to take not the route used to enter PoK but a different path that was longer and more circuitous, but comparatively safe. But while the Indian soldiers were returning, the Pakistan Army posts opened fire with everything they had -enraged by the cross-border strike.
“At one point, the bullets were so close, they were whistling past our ears. There’s a familiar put-put sound when rounds fly very close to your head,” Maj. Tango recalls. “If I were a foot taller, I would have been hit many times over.” During the circuitous escape, the men were frequently flat on the ground as trees in their path were shredded to bits by hails of ammunition, the book says.
“A particularly vulnerable 60-metre patch in the de-induction route gave the commandos their closest call. Still flat on their bellies, but with no natural feature hiding them, they needed to slither the full distance without being hit. Crossing in pairs as ammunition hit the ground inches from them, Maj. Tango’s team made it to the LoC before the sun was up, finally crossing it at 0430 hours.”"

Congress in Kerala on Sunday described BJP President Amit Shah’s claim that the saffron outfit would form the next government in the state as “daydream.” Asked about Shah’s statement in this regard at the BJP’s rally in Kozhikode on Saturday, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President V M Sudheeran said it was a ‘daydream’ of Shah.
WATCH VIDEO:

Referring to the party’s performance in the May 16 Assembly polls, Shah had claimed he was confident that in the next polls in the state, the party would form the government. Briefing reporters on deliberations of the KPCC Political Affairs Committee on Saturday, Sudheeran said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre “has only shown neglect and not fulfilled any of the promises it made.”
The Committee passed a resolution condemning the Uri attack and said it was the result of the failure of the BJP government, he said. “If the government had learned lessons from Pathankot attack, this would not have happened,” Sudheeran said. In the wake of Uri attack, BJP should have postponed the party’s National Council meet, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The issues regarding security of the nation have to be discussed in Parliament and not in party forum,” he added. Sudheeran said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised relief to rubber growers when he visited the state. “Nothing has been done on the matter,” he said. Similarly, the state’s request for amendments to the Coastal Regulation Zone notification that would enable local people, especially fishermen, to build and repair houses, has not been considered so far, he pointed out.
Besides, no cities and towns from Kerala have been included in the SmartCity project scheme announced by the Centre, he claimed. Attacking the BJP and CPI-M in the state, he alleged that these parties were trying to communally polarise the society. “Activities of LDF government and also that of CPI-M are actually helping BJP,” he said. Congress would take out a statewide campaign to expose both BJP and CPI-M, he added."

On September 27, a delegation of 20 students from Pakistan arrived in Chandigarh for the 11th Global Youth Peace Festival, bearing hand-written notes and friendship cards from various schools from across the country. But amid tensions that gripped India and Pakistan after the Uri attack and surgical strikes, the girls were worried if they’ll return home safe.
WATCH SUSHMA SWARAJ’S RESPONSE TO PAKISTANI GIRL

 
Aliya Harir, leader of the contingent and convenor of Indo-Pak friendship initiative titled Aaghaz-E-Dosti, reached out to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to help the girls return to Pakistan. Harir later tweeted that the minister has assured her of help.

But Sushma Swaraj — who had put up a strict front towards to Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly making sure they know that Kashmir belongs to India and will remain so — in her response to the girl, proved that the bitterness between the two countries will never come in the way of humanity. “Aliya – I was concerned about your well being kyonki betiyan to sabki sanjhi hoti hain” (I was concerned about your well being because one’s daughter is everyone’s daughter).

Back home, the girls’ parents and relatives were afraid for their well-being but they went ahead with their tour. Reportedly, parents of some of the girls told them that they won’t return alive. but Swaraj made sure the girls were felt safe. She spoke to Harir and asked her if they need any help from her. She also told them that if at any stage, they face any problem, they must immediately let her know. She emphasised that in Indian ethos, guests are treated like Gods ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ and that they should go back with happy memories of India.
But the girls have reached home safe and sound, Aliya tweeted this morning.

The attack on the 12th Brigade headquarters at Uri on Sunday in which 18 soldiers were killed is not the first time that an Indian government has had to weigh its response in the face of grave provocation that it attributed directly or indirectly to Pakistan. Post-Kargil in 1999, there have been at least three other occasions on which the nation and the government have found themselves in a situation similar to the one that is unfolding now — extreme public anger and pressure to give a “befitting reply” to Pakistan. This is how those situations unfolded, and the option that India finally exercised.
Watch Video: Uri Terrror Attack: What Are PM Modi’s 5 Options

Mumbai, 2008
Ten terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Toiba sailed to Mumbai by boat from Karachi, landed near Colaba on November 26, entered the city late that evening, and shot their way to the Chhattrapati Shivaji railway Terminus, the Taj Hotel, the Oberoi, and the Chabad House Jewish centre. The city was under siege for more than three days during which the terrorists killed 164 people and injured scores.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was caught alive on the first night of the attack, and came clean to his interrogators within hours. As the details of what he said emerged in the media, the UPA government and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh considered their response. On November 28, 2008, Singh chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security with the National Security Advisor, the Service chiefs and the intelligence heads. This was followed by another meeting on December 2. All options were considered, including an air strike to take out the LeT headquarters at Muridke, and terrorist training camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.
US Senator John McCain, who had unsuccessfully contested the Presidential election that year against Barack Obama, told a group of Pakistanis over lunch in Lahore that “the democratic government of India is under pressure and it will be a matter of days after they have given the evidence to Pakistan [that they decide] to use the option of force if Islamabad fails to act against the terrorists,” according to an editor who shared the details of that meeting with this writer that day. For an idea of the pressure that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was under, consider this: McCain told the group that Singh was “visibly angry and reeling from the shock of the attacks”. The Senator said that if Pakistan did not act to get the “bad guys”, India would have no option but to use force.
A combination of reasons led to India dropping the plan. One was a cold-eyed assessment by the Indian Service chiefs that they did not have the capability to limit a military retaliation — either geographically, or to conventional warfare.
The other was US pressure on India not to escalate matters. The US believed that a distraction for Pakistan forces on the eastern front would affect its own operations in Afghanistan. The outgoing Bush administration, led by Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, also made frantic efforts to persuade Pakistan to act against LeT.
The United Nations Security Council designated the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the name that LeT had taken after it was banned in Pakistan in 2002, as a terrorist front group, with Hafiz Saeed as its leader.
Watch What Else Is Making News

Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency carried out an investigation that confirmed that the 10 men were indeed Pakistanis. Some arrests were made, and a trial began.
India decided it would “pause” its bilateral ties with Pakistan until the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks were punished. But cross-LoC trade, which had been inaugurated just weeks ahead of the attack, and the cross-LoC bus, which was started in 2005, both continued without interruption.
Serious attempts to restart the relationship were made from July 2009. Dialogue took place in fits and starts but always failed as its furtherance was predicated on Pakistan bringing the Mumbai attack perpetrators to book. This situation continued right up to the time of the Uri attack, worsening along the way over the Pathankot attack in January this year.

Four months after the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York that year, following which the Bush Administration threatened to bomb Pakistan “back to the Stone Age” if it did not play ball in the US invasion of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, five heavily armed terrorists, allegedly from the Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba, drove into the Parliament complex using a fake entry pass and engaged security personnel in a one-hour gunbattle. The session had just been adjourned for the day, but some 100 Members of Parliament were in the complex. No Parliamentarian was injured, but 12 people, including security personnel, a gardener and a journalist, were killed in the attack.
The NDA was in power, and the next day, Union Home Minister L K Advani blamed Pakistan for “the most audacious” and the “most alarming act of terrorism in two decades”. According to a comprehensive account of the Indian response written by Steve Coll (The New Yorker, February 13, 2006), the Cabinet Committee on Security met the same evening, concluded that Pakistan’s ISI was behind the attack and, after a long discussion on options, decided that the threat of military action had to be made.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ordered troop mobilisation, and over the month of December, half a million soldiers massed on India’s western front. With the possibility of war looking real, Pakistan withdrew troops from the Afghan border where they were supporting the US war in Afghanistan, moving them to the border with India. In Coll’s account, the Americans were “distraught”, but understood there was “a real threat” from India, and that for Pakistan, it was a question of “national survival”.
Both countries were newly nuclear-armed, and the first Bush Administration considered the possibility of a nuclear war between the two South Asian neighbours to be real. His Secretary of State then, Colin Powell, visited both capitals and counselled calm. But Prime Minister Vajpayee declared that India had exercised enough restraint. It was only after the US persuaded General Pervez Musharraf to denounce jihadi groups in a speech in January 2002 that Vajpayee relented, and communicated to the Indian Army that there would be no operation for now.
But the troops remained at the border, and an incident in May 2002, in which three men in military fatigues killed 22 women and children, all family members of soldiers at the Kaluchak Army camp near Jammu, brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Western embassies issued travel advisories and discussed evacuation plans for their staff, with American fears high that a war between the two countries would not remain limited to a conventional military confrontation. Not just the Bush Administration, the British, and Russia’s President Valdimir Putin, too, exercised pressure on India to stay its hand.
Wrote Coll: “‘We almost went’” in May, (National Security Advisor Brajesh) Mishra told me, but Prime Minister Vajpayee, when he faced the final step, concluded that, at the end of a long political career, he wanted to be remembered as a man of peace. For some of Pakistan’s generals, Vajpayee’s decision seemed to offer a clear lesson: nuclear deterrence works.”
The demobilisation of Indian troops from the border took place in October 2002, and was followed by backchannel initiatives to bring both sides to the negotiating table. An unwritten ceasefire came into effect the following year, in October 2003, which continues — some would say in name only — till date.

On December 24, an Indian Airlines Airbus was hijacked shortly after it left Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport for New Delhi. On board were 176 passengers. The hijackers belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, a terrorist group that owed its origins to the ISI. Their demand was the release of several prisoners being held in India, including Masood Azhar, a high-value member of the Harkat-ul-Ansar, the name by which the HuM had been known earlier. A previous attempt, by a group called Al Faran, to have Masood Azhar and few other Harkat-ul-Ansar members released from prison in India, had failed. The Al Faran group had taken nine foreign hostages in Kashmir in 1995, and after India refused to give in, one of the hostages was found beheaded, another escaped, and the rest were never found.
But this time, Indian lives were on the line. The hijack took place around the same time as the coming of age of Indian television. Earlier that year, private Indian TV channels had beamed India’s military pushback against Pakistan at Kargil into homes across the country, whipping up nationalism and solidarity with the troops. The same TV channels now showed distraught relatives of the passengers on the plane begging the government to save the lives of their loved ones. A traumatised nation was transfixed by seven days of nail-biting drama, each day building more public pressure on the government.
After diverting the flight to Amritsar first, where it halted for 45 minutes, the hijackers directed it to Lahore. The plane was running out of fuel, and although Pakistan first denied it permission, it allowed the landing after it became clear there was no other option. After refuelling, the aircraft took off again, landing this time in Dubai, where the hijackers released 27 passengers and handed over to the authorities the body of Rupin Katyal, who was on his honeymoon to Nepal, and had bled to death after being stabbed on board. From Dubai, the pilot was ordered to take the aircraft to Kandahar in Afghanistan, then ruled by the Taliban.
According to several accounts of the hijacking, including one by A S Dulat, who headed R&AW at the time, in his book Kashmir, The Vajpayee Years, India considered sending the National Security Guard to storm the plane, but lost the best opportunity it had in Amritsar, as confusion reigned in Delhi on the next steps. A rescue operation was also considered in Dubai, but the hijackers may have got wind of it, and took off for Kandahar, where they were treated like state guests by the Taliban.
“My government will not bend before terror,” Prime Minister Vajpayee had declared on December 26. By the end of that month, the government had thrown in the towel.
The negotiations with the hijackers, conducted with the help of the UNDP head in Pakistan, Eric de Mul, could only achieve a paring down of the list of 36 prisoners that the hijackers wanted released, to three — Masood Azhar, Omar Saeed Sheikh, and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar.
The NDA government gave in to the demand. On the last day of the last century, Jaswant Singh travelled to Kandahar with the three men, where they were handed over to the Taliban. As the new millennium dawned, the nation rejoiced in the return of the passengers. The shock of the abject surrender would set in later. Masood Azhar went to Pakistan where he formed the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group the government holds responsible for the Uri attack, and before that, the attack in Pathankot, apart from the Parliament attack. Shaikh is in a Pakistani prison for the abduction and brutal murder of the journalist Daniel Pearl, while Zargar is believed to be living in PoK."

Virtually blaming Pakistan for the Uri terrorist attack, BJP President Amit Shah today said India’s fight against terrorism has reached a decisive stage

and the Modi government is moving in the right direction to ensure that the sacrifices of soldiers does not go waste. “Pakistan is trying to cause instability in India by constantly trying to lend support to terrorism and terrorist outfits.
“India has been constantly fighting against terrorism and this fight is now in a decisive stage,” he said in a statement. Shah added, “The martyrdom of the brave sons of India would not be allowed to go waste and the Central government is moving in the right direction.”

He made these remarks while expressing deep sorrow at the death of 17 soldiers in the attack. He paid his tributes to them and prayed for their soul to rest in peace."

The year 2016 could go down as one of the worst for Indo-Pak ties as terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups stalled the peace process and India’s surgical strikes inside PoK followed by trading of heavy fire at the border raised fears of a large-scale conflict. The year began on a sordid note when on January 2, Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militants stormed the Pathankot airbase in Punjab and killed seven security personnel before they were eliminated.
India demanded answers from Pakistan while linking the peace process to action against terrorism emanating from its soil.
The Pathankot attack was devastating for bilateral ties as it followed a brief but important visit to Lahore by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of the birthday of his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on December 25 last year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
That trip had come on the heels of a high-level visit by an Indian delegation led by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Islamabad in early December to attend the Heart of Asia conference on Afghanistan.
On the sidelines, she had fruitful talks with Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz and the two countries agreed to revive the stalled peace process.
The Indian Foreign Secretary was scheduled to visit Pakistan in mid-January but the Pathankot incident effectively scuttled the momentary thaw in ties.
The relations had not fully recovered from the blow when Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter with Indian security forces in Kashmir in July, setting in motion a chain of events which drove Pakistan and India in opposite directions.
In September, matters again came to a head between the two sides when JeM militants assaulted an army camp in Uri and killed 19 soldiers. The Indian government again demanded action from Pakistan. Just days after the assault, the two sides clashed at the UN General Assembly’s annual session, blaming each other for militancy and violation of human rights.
Raking up Kashmir at the UN, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif glorified Wani as a “young leader”. Sharif devoted much of his 20-minute speech at the UN General Assembly session to Kashmir and the situation in the Valley and said Pakistan “fully supports the demand of the Kashmiri people for self-determination”.
Swaraj delivered a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Sharif’s “tirade” on Kashmir, saying those accusing others of rights violations must introspect. India also censured Pakistan for the first time at the UNGA for perpetrating the “worst form of state oppression” in Balochistan.
India’s response to the Uri attack, came in the form of “surgical strikes” which Pakistan denied. India carried out “surgical strikes” on seven terror launch pads across the LoC with the Army inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK.
However, the move created a war-like situation on the Line of Control.
Dozens of soldiers and civilians were killed and injured in intermittent clashes at the border which went on for weeks. The two sides blamed each other for “unprovoked firing” and took reciprocal diplomatic action by summoning each other’s envoy many a times.
A major diplomatic row erupted between the two countries at the end of October when India declared a Pakistan High Commission staffer as persona non-grata for espionage activities after he was caught by Delhi Police with sensitive defence documents including deployment details of BSF along the Indo-Pak border.
In swift tit-for-tat action, Pakistan also declared an Indian High Commission official as persona non-grata and asked him to leave the country within 48 hours.
In a further blow to Indo-Pak ties, Pakistan pulled out six officials at its High Commission in November. The six Pakistani officials, including four senior diplomats, named for spying by a High Commission staffer, who was arrested and expelled for espionage, left India for home as bilateral ties continued to slide.
Pakistan then claimed that the Indian High Commission officials were involved in “espionage, subversion and supporting terrorist activities in Balochistan and Sindh, especially Karachi, sabotaging China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and fuelling instability in the two provinces.”
Those Indian officials named by Pakistan also returned to India subsequently. In late November, another terror attack took place at an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nagrota in which seven soldiers were killed, leading to further strain in ties.
The animosity between the two countries also shifted to the waters with the Indus Waters Treaty soon coming into focus.
India took strong exception to the World Bank’s decision to set up a Court of Arbitration and appoint a Neutral Expert to go into Pakistan’s complaint against it over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in Jammu and Kashmir.
However, in December, the World Bank paused the separate processes initiated by India and Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty to allow the two countries to consider alternative ways to resolve their disagreements.
Pakistan was also caught on the wrong foot when Aziz admitted that the government was presented with only “insufficient evidence” on alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav who is under detention.
Addressing a full Senate chamber, Aziz said the dossier on Jadhav contained mere statements. December again proved to be an important month for improving the situation.
This year, Amritsar was venue for the Heart of Asia conference and Pakistan decided to send Aziz for the meeting amid the strain in ties. But no bilateral meetings with the Indian side could take place and he only exchanged pleasantries with the top Indian leadership.
Meanwhile, Pakistan also saw a change of military command that could positively reflect on the Indo-Pak frontier.
General Qamar Javed Bajwa, an expert in PoK affairs, took over as Pakistan’s new army chief succeeding Gen Raheel Sharif and promised to improve the tense situation at the Line of Control soon.
In another important development, Lt Gen Naveed Mukhtar, an intelligence veteran, was appointed chief of Pakistan’s powerful spy agency ISI with new army chief Gen Bajwa effecting the first big reshuffle to tighten his hold on the military that plays a key role in the country’s affairs.
As part of a major shake-up of the military top brass, Bajwa abruptly removed Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen Rizwan Akhtar and named Mukhtar in his place while also ringing in several other changes.
Another significant development was Pakistan’s burgeoning ties with Russia. In December, Pakistan held its first-ever consultations with Russia over important global and regional issues amid warming ties between the former Cold War rivals.
In September, Russia held its first-ever military exercises with Pakistan and has also started selling weapons to Islamabad.
The closeness in Pakistan-Russia ties came amid growing Indo-US relations. Significantly, the US continued to nudge Pakistan to crackdown on terror safe havens.
The US Congress, earlier this month, said that USD 400 million in aid to Pakistan cannot be released unless the defence secretary certifies that Islamabad is taking “demonstrable steps” against the Haqqani network, which is accused of targeting American interests.
Passed by the Senate, the 2017 National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) in fact imposes four conditions on Pakistan to be eligible for USD 400 million of the USD 900 million of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF).
It would be naive to think of any drastic improvements in Indo-Pak ties in the coming months after serious tension, allegations and clashes in 2016.
The new year may start at a sour note due to the first anniversary of the Pathankot attack and possible demands by India for action against the alleged perpetrators.
Asked if 2017 will be better for bilateral ties, the Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman last week said it depends on the “Indian attitude, Indian intransigence and Indian behaviour to improve the security situation in the region”.
“India should show that it is ready for talks. It should show seriousness to resolve Kashmir,” Zakaria said."

(source: PTI)
India on Sunday said the terrorist attack in Uri in Kashmir has highlighted Pakistan’s desire to use “poison” instead of dialogue as it lodged a strong protest against Islamabad at the NAM summit in Venezuela for its “mischievous” and “malignant” support to terror. Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar hit out at Pakistan, saying it has reduced itself to “pariah” status in the international community because of its hypocrisy and its blatant sponsorship of terrorism and of terrorists.
Speaking to reporters after Pakistan Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz raised the Kashmir issue in Margarita Island at the 17th Non-Aligned Movement Summit, Akbar slammed Pakistan for giving “sanctuary and support, both domestic and international to terrorists” and investing in the evil menace of terrorism. He said India has lodged a strong protest in writing with NAM against Pakistan’s “mischievous, malignant use of terrorism particularly evident even while the summit is taking place in the tragic incident at Uri”.



“The tragic incident at Uri has highlighted Pakistan’s desire to use poison instead of dialogue. We will never accept the use of brutality as an instrument in international affairs,” he said. “The incident in Uri is a grave incident and not only India but the world is aggrieved by it. Pakistan should understand that it will be given a befitting reply and no one will back Pakistan on this,” he asserted.
Seventeen Indian soldiers where killed in a terror attack on an army base in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by suspected Pakistan-based militants early on September 18. Aziz, in his address as the Pakistan delegation head, had said “peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without the settlement of the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Akbar said that one of the important developments of the NAM summit was the fact that 118 nations out of 120 supported a stand on terrorism and wanted a working group on terrorism.
“The incoming president of NAM has assured us that terrorism will be high if not the highest on his objectives. He supports the need for a working group. I think all countries understand that irrespective of what might be attributed as reasons terrorism is now completely unacceptable to the world community,” Akbar said. “Pakistan’s inability to support the idea of a working group is further evidence that it has always been a sponsor. If it was not a sponsor why was it afraid of setting up a working group,” Akbar asserted.
Asked about Pakistan’s continuous campaign of raising Kashmir on global platforms, Akbar said, “The world understands that our position in Kashmir is legitimate. It has the backing of history and equally important it has the backing of moral behaviour in international affairs”.
“And that is why Pakistan’s continuous invidious attempts to keep raising the issue get no traction. It’s a voice crying in the wilderness,” he said."

In a masterstroke of political judo, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out in his thumping speech on Saturday, that Pakistan has failed its people. He laid down the gauntlet for India to fight Pakistan on a front where everyone wins – by challenging them to a race against poverty and unemployment. He also made the critical and important distinction between the mostly innocent people of Pakistan and its monster of an army and state.
If we wish to do justice to the martyrs at Uri, and to the thousands of brave young soldiers that have given their lives for the nation, we must first understand what they died for. Our soldiers did not die defending a vengeful, trigger-happy nation. They died defending our right to create a peaceful, stable, united, prosperous, and respected nation. A nation that can absorb a blow and move steadily forward.

In that respect, we have already had our revenge. Our revenge lies in the 300 million strong middle class we have created, in the hundreds of millions freed from extreme poverty, in our raucous free press, our fiercely independent Supreme Court, the IPL and our dominance of world cricket, the soft power of Yoga and Bollywood, and the global success of our MNCs. Today, we sit at every global table and are a critical part of all global forums (while Pakistan generally finds itself seated solely on the ones on terror).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To use a business analogy – when your career is going well, you are rapidly ascending the corporate ladder, and providing a better life for your family, you do not get into a fist fight with the neighborhood lout who keeps needling you out of jealously. You plow ahead and let your success be the revenge.
If this week’s news is to be believed, while India debated what constitutes a proportional response, Pakistan’s Army flew fighter jets above its capital, whipping its population into a state of panic. This pretty much encapsulates what India is up against: A belligerent, paranoid army, whose interests are not aligned with those of its people, and whose survival depends on a constant state of panic and fear. Knowing that India cannot be challenged militarily, and protected by their own nuclear weapons, their response has been to try to bleed India through asymmetric warfare – encouraging terrorism on our soil, and trying to keep tensions just high enough to justify their existence (the so called “death by a thousand cuts” policy).
Where previous governments have struggled to respond, Modi has disrupted this status quo, through a string of speeches starting from his Independence Day address.
First, by differentiating between the Pakistani people and the Pakistani military leadership, Modi places India firmly on the moral high ground. Modi’s challenge to Pakistan, in the face of grave provocation, to a war on poverty will resound well in capitals across the world. Further, this will cement the perception of India as a responsible country stuck with an unstable, dangerous neighbour.
Second, Modi has struck a direct blow to the pride of the Pakistani army and government by exposing their total failure in their responsibility to their people. He has a knack for finding the soft underbelly of his opponents and striking there. By trumpeting India’s social and economic successes versus Pakistan’s failures, he has taken the conversation beyond a simple tit-for-tat accounting of people killed. He has widened the game to a field where Pakistan is at a disadvantage.

Critically, in signature style, couched within Modi’s restraint is a very direct threat through his reference to Baluchistan. Pakistan’s supposed Islamic solidarity and championing of the “oppressed Kashmiri” has always been hypocritical. Resource-rich Baluchistan was annexed, against its will, to Pakistan in 1948 and since then a long running independence struggle has ensued. The Pakistani Army and Government have long practiced brutal political repression in this province with accusations being made of mass killings, human rights violations, and targeted rape. Modi’s message to Pakistan is unequivocal – continue to stir up trouble in Kashmir, and we will respond by supporting the freedom fighters in Baluchistan. Trouble in Baluchistan puts the Pakistan Army in the awkward position of condemning the supposed repression of Muslims in Kashmir, while simultaneously repressing Muslims within their own borders. It would sap their popularity and strain their already stretched resources. A loss of Baluchistan (comprising 40 per cent of Pakistan’s land mass) would be devastating.
Finally, Modi has silenced criticism from India’s chicken-hawks – every ready to call for war, without really knowing the huge cost that it entails. His message to them is – we are winning, let us focus of our areas of victory and not be distracted by the inevitable set back. We cannot stop all attacks, but we are strong enough to absorb a few blows and determined enough to strike back in a manner that is most beneficial to us.
I think the nation would do well to support the Prime Minister’s lead. We must not let ourselves be baited into a fight that can only damage us, we must not allow ourselves to blindly hate an entire people, and instead, we should trust this government to respond in a manner befitting our global status."

A hoarding near the VVIP guest house crossing in Lucknow welcomes the Defence Minister to the city while in the trans-Gomti areas, BJP corporator Ranjeet Singh Yadav has put up hoardings with messages saluting soldiers for the LoC strikes. These hoardings carry images of Modi, Home Minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh, Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma and soldiers. Ranjeet Singh Yadav too is visible.
In the bylanes of Agra, huge banners carry messages from local BJP leaders, congratulating Modi and Parrikar for destroying terrorist camps.
Asked about the banners, Parmendra Jain, BJP media in-charge of Agra Mahanagar, said: “It’s not just about BJP. People everywhere are happy that the Modi government has given Pakistan a befitting reply. Nobody wants to do politics on this issue. But it is obvious we are all happy with the development and want to show our gratitude to Prime Minister Modi and our brave soldiers.”

In Muzaffarnagar, posters at several crossings carry one message: “We will kill you and kill you for sure but with our gun, our bullet, at our time of convenience, but at your place.” The message is next to a large photograph of the Prime Minister. Others featured are BJP president Amit Shah, Union Minister and MP Sanjeev Baliyan, UP party president Keshav Maurya and BJP’s Muzaffarnagar MLA Kapil Agarwal.
Agarwal told The Indian Express that BJP workers had placed the posters. He said no such poster had been removed.
But BJP district president Rupendra Saini said the local unit had nothing to do with the posters. “MLA sahib has his own printing press and he keeps putting up posters. I don’t have any knowledge about such posters,” Saini said.
In Varanasi, the Prime Minister’s constituency, Shiv Sena worker Ajay Chaubey put up posters backing the surgical strikes. The posters carry the Shiv Sena symbol with images and messages announcing ‘Ramroopi Narendra Modiji’, ‘Ravanroopi Pakistan ka ant ho’, ‘Meghnadroopi Kejriwal… Pakistan ke samarthak’. These posters call for more surgical strikes.

UP Shiva Sena chief Anil Singh disowned the posters, saying Chaubey used to be the party head of Varanasi division until his expulsion last year. But Chaubey maintained he was never expelled and that he was the state co-head of the party. He said he had put up 235 such posters across Varanasi.
“Nawaz Sharif is Ravan of Kalyug and Arvind Kejriwal is like Meghnad because he does not have faith in the Indian Army and media reports. He has asked for evidence of the surgical strikes,” Chaubey said.
Other hoardings in the city, greeting the Prime Minister and the Army for the strikes, carry photographs of Modi, Shah and Maurya."

After many actors opened up about their thoughts on the ban being imposed on the Pakistani actors in response to the Uri attack, the popular composer duo Salim-Sulaiman and Assamese artiste Papon on Wednesday (October 23) urged people to keep music and musicians away from politics amidst the ongoing unrest between India and Pakistan following the September 18 attack in Jammu and Kashmir.
At an event here to announce folk and fusion music festival Paddy Fields, the artistes, asked their thoughts regarding the ban of Pakistani artistes in India and curtailed cross-border cultural exchange between the two countries, chose to be diplomatic. Salim said: “We should respect music and musicians beyond the border and politics.” To that, Sulaiman added: “Having said that, we must not forget that we are a part of the music fraternity. If it is the official decision of the fraternity not to work with any musicians from a particular country, we are bound to follow the rule.”
Asked about his opinion, Papon said: “I am an artiste and do not follow politics regularly. However, I think music is a universal language that should not be limited based on borders. Borders are being created for political reason, let’s keep the music out of it (politics).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The musicians were gathered at a press conference for the upcoming two-day music fest Paddy Fields, organized by Nesco, in association with Big 92.7 FM. This will feature various folk artistes from across the country, coming together to perform at the Bombay Exhibition Centre in Goregaon here October 15-16.
The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, following the Uri attack that killed 19 Indian soldiers, issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave the country, and threated they won’t let any Bollywood films with Pakistani actors release. Following that, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution to avoid working with Pakistani artistes until bilateral tensions between the two countries subside."

When the news of sepoy Ganesh Shankar’s death reached them Monday morning, the family was busy making plans for the wedding of his younger sister, Indrawati, 20.
“Indrawati’s wedding was fixed in Gorakhpur a few days ago. On Monday morning, we were talking about preparations needed for marriage functions when locals informed about Ganesh Shankar’s death. It got confirmed when mediapersons reached our place,” said Ganesh’s elder brother, Suresh Chandra Yadav, a farmer. Ganesh, 34, is survived by his wife Gudia Yadav and children Amrita, 9, Ankit, 7, and Khushi, 4.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Ganesh was the only earning member of our family,” said Suresh. The family will now have to depend on a small piece of land. “We spoke to Ganesh five days ago. We told him Indrawati’s marriage had been fixed and the date would be decided when he comes home. He promised to come in October.”
Ganesh had joined the Army in 2003 and served at several places. He was transferred to Uri only on August 22."

After days of uncertainty over the release of Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, the Bollywood fraternity has been promised a “great Diwali” by Union home minister Rajnath Singh with a safe and secure release of the film. Mukesh Bhatt, President of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, on Thursday met Singh who assured a safe release of the film on October 28 — two days before the festival of lights. Johar skipped the meeting as he is busy with the post-production of the film in Mumbai, sources added.

Bhatt, along with singer-politician Babul Supriyo, met Singh to appeal for security amid vandalism threats from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), which is against the movie’s release as it features Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. “We are entertainers. We are interested in working with artistes, and not whether they belong to Pakistan, China or Africa,” Bhatt told the media after meeting Singh. MNS had refused to change its stance despite Johar saying in a video message that he will not work with talent from Pakistan in the future.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As the head honcho of the producers’ guild, Bhatt had earlier met a Mumbai police representative to appeal for police protection to ensure that the city’s theatres which will screen Ae Dil Hai Mushkil remain safe. Asked if they didn’t have full faith in the Mumbai Police, he said: “I will give them 200 per cent marks to Mumbai police. But the film isn’t releasing just in Mumbai. We want to safeguard ourselves, so who better than the home minister? It is his domain.”

Before his meeting with Singh, Bhatt said that it is, as a citizen, that he feels it’s his “right to feel safe”. “We want to celebrate Diwali. We want to get entertained with a good family entertainer film. I feel that the state is definitely going to give me support and protection against people who want to create violence for no reason,” he said.
Bhatt also said people are free to see the movie. “India is a free country, but at least you should not stop people and then stop people violently. That is something I feel that the government of today should have zero tolerance towards, violence.”

 
 
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has become the first target of those who are against inclusion of Pakistani artistes in Indian films after the September 18 Uri attack which killed 19 Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack was followed by surgical attacks that India conducted across LoC.
The subsequent bilateral unrest between India and Pakistan had a spill over in film industries on both sides of the border. While the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to quit India, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution asking producers to avoid working with talent from Pakistan.

Hours after the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) met Wednesday, the government summoned the Pakistan envoy and conveyed to him that Pakistan-based terrorists had carried out Sunday’s attack on an Army camp in Uri which left 18 soldiers dead.
Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar told Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit that India had recovered several items from the slain terrorists — GPS, grenades with Pakistani markings, communication equipment, food, medicines and clothes made in Pakistan. He said Delhi was ready to provide fingerprints and DNA samples of the terrorists killed in Uri and Poonch if Islamabad “wishes to investigate these cross-border attacks”.

Jaishankar, who called Basit to his South Block office, told him that even as he spoke, two engagements were going on at the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. He reminded Pakistan of its commitment not to allow its soil or territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India, and said it must live up to its public commitment.
This is the third time since August that the Ministry of External Affairs has summoned the Pakistan High Commissioner — Basit had earlier been called following the capture of terrorist Bahadur Ali and over the discourtesy to the Indian envoy in Karachi.
MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said Jaishankar called in the Pakistan High Commissioner and reminded him that his government had made a solemn commitment in January 2004 not to allow its soil or territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India. “Persistent and growing violation of this undertaking is a matter of very serious concern,” he said.
The Uri attack, he said, only “underlines that the infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan remains active. We demand that Pakistan lives up to its public commitment to refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism against India”.
Beginning with the Pathankot airbase attack, there have been continuous attempts this year by armed terrorists to cross the LoC and International Boundary to carry out attacks in India, he said.
He said 17 such attempts have been interdicted at or around the LoC, resulting in the elimination of 31 terrorists and preventing their intended acts of terrorism. “Foreign Secretary also reminded him (Basit) that even as he spoke, two engagements at the LoC were ongoing,” he said.
“In the recent incidents, we have recovered a number of items that include: GPS from the bodies of terrorists with coordinates that indicate the point and time of infiltration across the LoC and the subsequent route to the terror attack site; grenades with Pakistani markings; communication matrix sheets; communication equipment; and other stores made in Pakistan, including food, medicines and clothes. We now expect a response from the Government of Pakistan,” he said.
Earlier Wednesday, the CCS met for the first time since the Uri attack. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, sources said, briefed the CCS on the overall security situation.
A senior official said, “Basically, the government has opened the way for the entire relationship with Pakistan to be reviewed. There will be no going back to business as usual.”
Government sources warned that the situation could rapidly change in the event of further strikes on either civilian or military targets."

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Pakistan a “mothership of terrorism”, China today strongly defended its all-weather ally, saying it is against linking any country or religion with terror and asked the world community to acknowledge Pakistan’s “great sacrifices”.
In a sharp reaction to a question about Modi’s characterisation of Pakistan at the BRICS Summit in Goa, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Hua Chunying said China is opposed to linking any country to terrorism.

Answering a question on Modi’s criticism of Islamabad in aiding and abetting terror groups opposed to India, she said “on counter-terrorism, China’s position is consistent”.
“It is the same way we oppose linking terrorism with any specific country or religion,” she said.
“We oppose terrorism in all forms and we believe that international concerted efforts are needed to ensure stability and security of all countries,” she said.
“We oppose linking terrorism with any specific ethnicity or religion. This is our long-standing position. China and Pakistan are all-weather friends.
Noting that India and Pakistan are “all victims of terrorism”, she said Islamabad has made “great sacrifice to combat terrorism and this needs to be recognised by the international community”.
To another question about Modi’s criticism that Pakistan State continues to support anti-India terrorist groups giving them arms, financial support and helping them to cross the border to carry out attacks in India and whether it is China’s view that international community should not take a stand on Islamabad’s support to terrorists, Hu said: “I understand your concern.”
“But, as I said on counter-terrorism China’s position is consistent. It is the same way we oppose linking terrorism with specific country or religion,” she said.
“As per the problem between India and Pakistan, both the two countries are close neighbours of China. We truly hope that they can resolve these differences in a peaceful way through dialogue and consultation, so that India and Pakistan relations can develop. This serves the interest of the two countries and the region,” she said."

India on Sunday said that a mutually acceptable mechanism among BRICS nations needs to be worked out to ensure that MNCs do not dodge taxes, along with norms to curb black money and bring those accused of corruption and tax evasion to justice.
WATCH VIDEO: ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’


The Ministry of External Affairs’ secretary (economic relations), Amar Sinha said: “A key issue that we are pushing, is the issue of tax evasion, black money and corruption. Tax evasion, because under the complex international tax architecture, there are companies especially MNCs and others which have a presence across borders, they end up paying no tax anywhere and they shift their profits.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“So one of the key ideas is that the taxation and the BRICS leaders have agreed, that the taxation should happen at the point where the activity takes place, not where perhaps their registered headquarters are or where their main subsidiary is or the holding company is. That is one way of sort of evading taxes and there are companies which are not paying taxes anywhere,” he said.
Sinha also said that there was need for mutually agreeable norms to bring to book white collar criminals who cross international borders to avoid action.
“Both, people who are needed for corruption or white collar crimes or tax evasion have fled. They have to be brought back and along with that the assets that is parked in safe havens, needs to be brought back. So tax evasion, black money and people who are needed in corrupt cases, etc, are key decision of the BRICS leaders and develop norms which could be accepted by others,” he said.
The BRICS countries on Sunday pitched for a stronger global commitment for combating corruption and repatriation of black money in overseas jurisdictions, saying these along with aggressive tax practices hurt equitable development and economic growth. “We will strive to coordinate our approach… and encourage a stronger global commitment to prevent and combat corruption on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other relevant international legal instruments,” said the Goa declaration."

Several top American lawmakers have strongly condemned the Uri terror attack in Kashmir, saying there is a need to work together to combat terrorism and hoped the perpetrators behind the deadly assault are brought to justice. “Strongly condemn recent terrorist attack at Indian Army base in Uri – deepest condolences to the victims, their families & people of India,” Senator John McCain, Chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, tweeted.
Eighteen soldiers were killed and several others injured as heavily-armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town early Sunday. Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed by the Army.
Congressman Elliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Uri terror attack along with the bombings in New York and New Jersey “demonstrate our need to continue to work together through our” counter-terrorism partnership to defeat terrorism.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Congresswoman Grace Meng, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and its Subcommittee on Asia, also condemned the attack and hoped that those behind the deadly assault on Indian troops are apprehended and brought to justice. “I send my thoughts and prayers to the victims and families, and all who have been impacted by this unacceptable and heinous violence,” she said.
In an op-ed, Lisa Curtis of The Heritage Foundation said that the US should also condition military assistance to Pakistan on its success in cracking down on terror groups and called on Indian and Pakistani officials to tone down their rhetoric against each other and refrain from making references to developments in territory under the other’s control.
“The latter is especially important during the current UN General Assembly,” Curtis said, adding that the US has an interest in preventing military escalation between the “two nuclear-armed foes.”"

The relationship between India and Pakistan has been strained over the past month after the Uri attacks that killed 19 Indian soldiers. In retaliation, the Indian Army announced that it carried out surgical strikes on seven launch pads along the Line of Control. At the United Nations General Assembly, India made its stand against terrorism very clear and even pointed out Pakistan’s role in terrorism.
Amid the ongoing situation, a rather old video of a Pakistani girl questioning the role of military in terrorism during what looks like a conference has gone viral on social media. The video, uploaded by Viral in India on October 10, has been shared massively and already has over 800,000 views. Though it has been uploaded by various other YouTube accounts now.
The girl starts by saying that she is surprised to realise that they have spoken on terrorism for over 10 minutes but not once have they mentioned military. “We should try and learn from our history and the history of terrorism in Pakistan is linked with military,” she says.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Many, in the comments section, have praised her for being brave while some are worried for her safety.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be pressing ahead with unconventional pressure tactics on Pakistan to isolate it internationally in the aftermath of the Uri terror attack. As the PM looks for alternate options to military action, a review of the Indus Water Treaty looks a potent weapon in his armoury.
India-Pakistan relations have taken a bitter form after the terrorist attack on the Uri base that killed 19 Indian soldiers. Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism has forced India into taking pressure tactics as the government reiterates strategic restraint. Meanwhile, Pakistan has washed its hands off the issue and denied having any hand in the attack and termed the attack as an act of rebellion from Kashmiri militants despite compelling evidence that it was carried out by Pakistan-based terrorist groups.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India’s response to the Uri attack needs to be well thought out. After raising Pakistani atrocities in Balochistan on the UN stage, it is now the Indus river system – a major natural resource in the region – that is the centre of Modi’s ‘isolate Pakistan strategy’.
Extreme steps like abrogation of the treaty may not interest India at the moment. However, its review in times of sustained hostilities from Pakistan, could put pressure on Pakistan. It doesn’t seem that India’s decision to review will present the country as an aggressor that doesn’t follow international obligations. The concerns which arise are Pakistan’s ally China acting similarly on the rivers flowing to India. Though, at the moment, it appears that the government’s priority is sending a strong message across to Islamabad that India will not sit idle and take decisive steps against Pakistan.

The government has shown that it has a set of plans to act against Pakistan in such times without resorting to military action. Any attack risks drawing criticism from India’s allies and the US which is against any military escalation between the countries. However, sanctions, pressure tactics, diplomatic isolation are options that PM Modi seems open to considering.
The Indus water treaty was signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 that put an end to a 12-year tussle for water sharing from the Indus system of rivers. Pakistan gets 80 per cent of water from the Indus. The system has three eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas and Sutlej and their tributaries— and equal number of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab along with their tributaries. Under the agreement, waters from the eastern rivers are allocated to India.
Also, India is “under obligation to let flow the waters of the Western Rivers”. The exceptions in this case are for—domestic use, non-consumptive use, agricultural use and generation of hydroelectric power. Several experts have contended that farming the waters flowing in the western tributaries through ‘run of the river’ will not put India into a legal trouble and it would not constitute violation of the treaty. These waters can be used for irrigating farmland and for production of hydroelectric power.
It is still too soon to say that a review will actually be setup. However, India will aim to gain leverage through the pressure and force Pakistan to act against the terrorists operating on its soil."

Hitting out at Nitish Kumar, Union minister Upendra Kushwaha on Sunday described the Bihar chief minister as the ‘most selfish’ leader of the century whose “words never match his deeds”.
“Nitish Kumar must be the century’s most selfish leader. Among the leaders whose words don’t match their deeds, Nitish tops the chart. He can go to any extent for the sake of preserving his image,” the Minister of the State in the HRD Ministry said.

“After fighting to ensure his (Shahabuddin) jail, he (Nitish) helped the same person in getting bail after coming to power. It’s only after public uproar they moved the Supreme Court against it,” Kushwaha said, in an obvious reference to the gangster-turned-politician.
The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) chief was addressing the party’s national convention here after being re-elected as its president, where he also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take tough action against terrorism referring to the Uri attack.
RLSP also passed a political resolution where it vowed to fight for reservations in the private sector and in the media. Kushwaha said before according reservation status to any community, the category has to be broadened.
He also accused Samajwadi Party and RJD of having “betrayed” the socialist cause and entrenching dynastic politics. They work only for “their families”, he said.
“A champion of social justice recently accused the Centre of abolishing reservation in the posts of associate professors at Central Universities. But when did they even provide it? We will fight for it when Kushwahas get power at the Centre,” he said."

(Source: IE Archive)
 
Army on Sunday said the militants’ group, which carried out the attack on its Uri camp, was looking to hit civilian targets in order to create fear ahead of the third phase polling in the state.
“(Either side of) the road between Baramulla and Uri is densely populated now. The aim must have been to come and strike at civilian targets to cause fear and disrupt the peaceful conditions ahead of the polls,” General Officer

Commanding of Army’s 15 Corps Lt General Subrata Saha told reporters here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Lt General Saha, however, dismissed assertions that the attacks were due to failure of the counter-infiltration grid

along the Line of Control (LoC). “Had that been the case they could have attacked the civilian targets that they were

looking for,” he added.
Eleven security personnel including eight soldiers were killed in the pre-dawn attack on the Army camp by militants,

who had infiltrated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, before all the six assailants were shot dead.
“They (militants) came and banged against this position of ours and where in a span of barely 60 odd metres, all the

six terrorists were neutralised,” Lt Gen Saha said, adding “the fact they have been eliminated, the security grid has

succeeded with a heavy price.”
Paying tribute to the soldiers and policemen killed in the operation, Lt Gen Saha said it is their brave fight that

ensured that the attack on civilian targets was avoided and “any harm to innocent civilians, particularly during this

period when elections are on, was avoided”.
Mohra, the scene of the deadly gunbattle on Friday, is located 10 kilometres from the Haji Peer Pass and Kamalkote,

the nearest points on the Line of Control. There are several densely populated villages located between the army camp targeted by the militants and the LoC.
The army commander said there was enough evidence to show that the assailants were supported by the Pakistani

establishment and that the attack and other incidents before it along the Line of Control in Kashmir were coordinated and synchronised."

On September 25, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Mann Ki Baat and touched upon a range topics. He started with his response to the terrorist attack on army base in Uri, in which 19 of Indian soldiers lost their lives. He said, those behind the attacks will not be spared. “I pay my tribute to soldiers who lost their lives in Uri terror attack. The culprits will be punished for sure,” he said.
He also talked about an Class XI student who, after the attacks, resolved to study 3 hours extra so he can contribute to the nation. The boy wrote a letter to Modi in which he wrote the attacks disturbed him a lot and he wanted to do something about it, but he didn’t know what. “What can a student like me do?” Modi quoted him. “That’s when I pledged to study 3 more hours every day so I can become a responsible citizen of the country and cab be put to use”. The PM praised him for his thoughts amid today’s charged environment.

But wherever Harshvardhan is and especially if he’s on Twitter, he might be reconsidering writing that letter to the PM because he’s dominating the micro-blogging site right now. Jokes and memes on his just won’t stop!https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Harshvardhan’s father is praying for few more terror attack, so that he could see his son in the toppers list of UPSC,” tweeted a user. “According to a recent study, India will have to lose Kargil, if Harshvardhan has to clear IITJEE,” wrote another.

Actor Randeep Hooda says it has become difficult for artistes in India to express their opinions on socio-political issues without being labelled or evading judgments, and that’s why actors prefer keeping their views to themselves. Randeep said that like any other Indian citizen, artistes have the same sentiments towards the country and there are times they want to share their views but the fear of bashing stops them from doing so. Mentioning his own experience, the 40-year-old actor said, “I will state an example, I am doing this film Battle of Saragarhi. I was doing infantry training for it, when one day, I woke up to the news of Uri attacks. It wasn’t war. These boys (army men) were sleeping and they were attacked. I was affected by it then I went for the morning drill and there were young boys all 19-20 of age. I looked into their eyes and thought to myself that it could have been them.”

He added, “There were talks going on about isolating them (Pakistan) diplomatically and economically. I went on social media where #BanPakArtists was trending. So, I wrote we should also isolate them culturally. I used that hashtag and for that got a lot of brickbats. I got silent treatment and still get that. It was my attempt to stop violence but it was seen as something against artistes. We are artistes but we are also citizens of a country.”
Citing the example of Hollywood actor Meryl Streep’s powerful speech at Golden Globes two months ago in which she criticised US President Donald Trump, Randeep said that Indian actors can never pull off something like that. “Everyone heard Meryl Streep’s beautiful speech at Golden Globes. She was lauded. She was very witty she was to the point. I also lauded her. When she said that a lot of people here said that why don’t Indian actors talk about these things. This is exactly why we don’t. Is it okay that if you speak against the establishment it is freedom of speech and if you speak something you like about the establishment, you are labelled as bootlicker and what not. Why can’t we express an opinion or desire without being labelled? That’s the problem,” he said.

Sombre senior army officials, jawans (soldiers) of the Eastern Command, and teary-eyed relatives of the martyrs were present at the NSC Bose International Airport here when the coffins carrying the mortal remains of Sepoys Gangadhar Dolui and Biswajit Garai were flown in by the aircraft C 130 on Monday evening.

Dolui hailed from Jamuna Balia village in Howrah district, while Garai was a resident of South 24 Parganas district’s Ganga Sagar.
The bodies were then sent to the Command Hospital for the night.
On Tuesday morning, the remains of Sepoy Dolui would be sent by road to reach Howrah by around 5 a.m.
The body of Sepoy Ghorai will be brought to the airport by 9 a.m. from where it will be flown by a special IAF helicopter to Ganga Sagar.
At both places, the ceremonial funeral will be conducted by army, a defence ministry spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, parents of Sepoy Dolui have demanded justice and strict punishment for the perpetrators, amid an all-pervading gloom at Jamuna Balia village.
“I demand justice and strict punishment for those who killed my son,” Doluia’s mother said.
“I can’t believe that my son is no more,” she said.
His father said Dolui, 22, had hardly completed a year with the army.
“He was the sole breadwinner in my family. How are we going to survive now,” Onkar Nath Dolui said.
“We strongly condemn the terrorist attack at Uri. Indian government should take stern steps so that such incidents do not happen again,” he said."

In the aftermath of the Uri attack and intelligence inputs of a terror threat to the national capital, Delhi Police is carrying out a review of the security measures in place for VIPs. The security audit involves plugging loopholes, if any, in the current security cover being provided to the protectees, mock drills and regular briefings of officers.
“Currently, we have finished the security audit of Z+ and Z protectees. We have initiated the security audit of Y and X protectees and this will be finished by next week,” said a senior police officer. Depending on the threat perception to the person, the category is divided into four tiers: Z+ (highest level), Z, Y and X. Individuals under the security blanket include the President, Vice-President, Prime-Minister, Supreme Court & High Court Judges and service chiefs of Armed Forces.

Senior officers say security audits are usually carried out before August 15 and January 26 but after the Uri attacks and the current festive season which means more public visits for the dignitaries, it was thought necessary to review the arrangements. “It is essential for officers in the security wing to be alert at all times. They undergo drills at regular intervals but during a time like this, the frequency and intensity of drills is high,” said the officer.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Situational firing practice and briefings about how terrorists might be plotting the attack are key features of these audits. “For instance, they are made to do firing practice at regular intervals. But in a time like this, we test whether they will be able to handle a real-time situation in case an attack happens. Anybody can shoot at a dummy target but it is essential that they are trained to shoot at real targets. So we create a situation where there are four armed people who are coming to attack and we test the response time and instinctive abilities of the personnel,” said the officer.Delhi NewsDelhi HC says its conscience is shaken, dismisses bail plea of gun-toting riot accusedDelhi: In second wave, more children and infants in hospital with Covid-19E-rickshaw driver arrested for sexually assaulting two minorsClick here for more
Apart from these drills, there are also sessions where the security officers are briefed about the terror attack that happened and the way it was carried out. “It’s important for the officers to know the threat perception and the ways an attack might be planned. After the Uri attack, we have been briefing our officers about the possible ways in which terrorists can strike and what should their response be in case an emergency situation arises,” said the officer."

Admitting that Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar is in Pakistan and is “unwell”, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi Friday said his government can act against Azhar only if India presents “solid” and “inalienable” evidence that can stand in a court of law.
His remarks come amid heightened tension between India and Pakistan in the wake of the February 14 Pulwama attack where 40 CRPF men were killed by a suicide bomber for which Jaish had claimed responsibility.

Following Qureshi’s remarks, India, backed by France, the United States and the United Kingdom, is all set to move a fresh proposal before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) naming Azhar and Jaish responsible for the Pulwama attack, seeking a ban.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“He (Azhar) is in Pakistan and according to my information, he is unwell and so much that he cannot leave his house,” Qureshi said in an interview to CNN. Asked about India trying to get Azhar listed before the UNSC and whether Pakistan would welcome it, Qureshi said: “We will be open to any step that leads to de-escalation and if they (India) have good, solid evidence, please sit and talk. Please initiate a dialogue, we will show reasonableness.”
“If they have solid, inalienable evidence that is acceptable to courts of Pakistan, share it with us so that we can convince the people and we can convince the independent judiciary of Pakistan…We need to satisfy the legal process.”
Qureshi also said that the release of captured IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is a “peace gesture” and must be seen as Pakistan’s “willingness to de-escalate”. Varthaman, who in Pakistan’s custody since Wednesday was released at the Wagah border Friday.
Over the last week, India carried out air strikes against a Jaish training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot after which Pakistan claimed it shot down an Indian fighter jet over Pakistani air space and arrested Varthaman.

Listing Azhar’s involvement in terror, India’s dossier to Pakistan says, “Azhar was a known associate of Usama Bin Laden, having been used as a motivator in various African countries, on account of his ability as a good orator on matters related to jihad. He is known by many as the Pakistani cleric who brought jihad into the religious discourse at mosques in the UK. He was arrested preaching jihad in Jammu and Kashmir in 1994.”
The proposal for the ban under the UN’s Sanctions Committee 1267, when moved, will be the fourth bid in the past ten years. During all previous attempts, China has blocked the ban on Azhar with a “technical hold”.
According to Indian agencies, After 9/11, Laden was cornered and the JeM became the key conduit to bring fighters and their families from Afghanistan into safe havens in Pakistan, run by JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba. While describing the capability of Jaish, India’s draft proposal says, “JeM is an organisation that does not just impact India, but feeds on pan-Islamism and has been a major threat to global peace and security.”

The group, according to documents accessed by The Indian Express, was responsible for the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack when heavily armed militants attacked the Air Force Station, part of the Western Air Command of the Indian Air Force, in which one civilian and 7 security personnel were killed. The National Investigation Agency named Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf Asghar as the key conspirators in the attack.
Besides the attacks in Pulwama and Pathankot, the draft proposal names Azhar for the 2016 Uri attack where which a group of four Jaish terrorists attacked an Army brigade headquarters near the Line of Control and killed 17 Army personnel and injured another 30. The dossier further lists dozens of other attacks carried out by Jaish on security forces and Army installations in J&K from 2000-2014, the IC 814 hijacking that helped secure Azhar’s release and the 2001 Parliament attack after his release."

With Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee continuing to maintain silence on the “surgical strikes” carried out by the Army at the LoC, the BJP has alleged that it was indicative of the Trinamool Congress’ “policy of minority appeasement” and anti-nationalism. The leaders of the ruling party in West Bengal, however, termed the party chief’s silence as “strategic restraint”.
BJP state president Dilip Ghosh pointed out that while all parties, including the Congress, congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Army, Mamata has remained quiet. “It shows that the she is not happy over the strategic strikes on Pakistan terror camps. The CM will have to break her silence and clear the state’s stand on the issue,” Ghosh said.
Watch What Else Is making News
 

A senior TMC leader close to the CM, however, explained that “Mamata’s silence” is indicative of the stand that she has taken. “In a situation such as this, where the details of the strike are still unknown, it is impossible to comment without making certain assumptions. Bengal doesn’t share a border with Pakistan and her focus right now is on the state. When the time is right and if there is a need, she’ll comment on the issue,” the leader said, requesting not to be named.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another senior TMC leader pointed to Mamata’s concern over Muharram and Durga Puja coinciding in the coming week and said that she had restrained herself from making any statement that could “be twisted to charge the atmosphere communally”. In her last Cabinet meeting before the festive week, Mamata had strictly instructed all ministers and MLAs to stay at “their home constituencies” and work closely with the police in case of any “untoward incident”. She had gone on to make a statement to the public, urging them to maintain peace.
“It’s not a question of whether or not Mamata is against the Indian army. That is not even the question. Two men from our state lost their lives in the Uri attack. We have bled for the nation. But if she makes a statement, there are certain elements who’ll try and make the issue a communal one and try and spread hatred. By remaining silent, she has side-stepped the entire issue while not compromising on her criticism of the Modi government’s destruction of federalism,” the leader said.
Meanwhile, a third school of thought exists in the TMC, which points out that any comment on the surgical strikes —- either congratulating the government or opposing them —- would serve to weaken Mamata’s ongoing criticism of the Centre’s treatment of state governments. “While not saying anything, Mamata has avoided the pitfall of having to dilute her own opposition of the government’s policies regarding the state. Ministers and MLAs are continuing their political opposition of the Centre’s policy at different avenues,” said a senior Cabinet minister of the party.
The “strategy”, however, hasn’t done much to placate the BJP. “The way Bengal has become a safe haven for terrorists, it shows how weak the state government is when it comes to taking steps against these terror outfits,” Ghosh said.
The BJP has also decided to launch a ‘Save Democracy Movement’ from November 30 to December 14 against Trinamool Congress’ alleged attempt to make the state “Opposition-free” by using “unfair, undemocratic and unconstitutional strategies”, Ghosh added."

Bangladesh High Commissioner to India Syed Muazzem Ali  has said his country’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is yet to take a decision on whether to attend or not to attend the upcoming South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit to be held in Pakistan capital Islamabad in November.
“Well as you know the SAARC Summit is a major SAARC event, and heads of governments normally attend this. So, if there is not enough participation of heads of governments, obviously you know that it did not get the full attention and full importance of the other member countries. So, we will see as we come to that particular situation. As of now, the SAARC Summit scheduled to be held in sometime in November and no final decision has been taken by our Prime Minister regarding her participation, but as soon as the decision is taken, I certainly can tell you,” Ali said.

“My Prime Minister (Sheikh Hasina) is coming to India to attend the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) Summit that would take place on October 16, only a few days from now, and she would have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I am sure that there would be a discussion on this. Perhaps, at the Goa event, our two Prime Ministers can also discuss regarding their attendance at the forthcoming SAARC Summit in Islamabad,” Ali added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When asked if he thought that Pakistan-sponsored terrorism was a major disruption in the region, the Bangladesh High Commissioner said, “In the Bangladeshi terrorist acts, we have so far investigated all aspects of the matter, and those are home-grown terrorists, but those were receiving support and assistance from abroad. But as regard to this particular cross-border terrorism (Uri), it is obvious that in that particular militarised zone nobody can come to this area without coming from the other side.
“So, basically we are exploring different options. As you know that the Government of India yesterday (Monday) discussed about various options that are on the table, and once the decisions are taken, I am sure, there will be high level consultations between the two Prime Ministers (PMs of India and Bangladesh).”
Reacting to the Uri terrorist attack, Ali said his prime Minister had on Monday in a message to Prime Minister Modi had categorically stated Bangladesh’s position and went on to quote Prime Minister Hasina as saying: “Bangladesh strongly condemns terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations in line with the zero tolerance policy against terrorism and violent extremism, Bangladesh firmly stands besides India at this difficult hour as a close friend and neighbour. We would continue to work together in our common endeavour to eradicate the menace of cross-border terrorism from this region and beyond.”
“So, basically, as I mentioned, she has very categorically condemned this act of terrorism and she has maintained that Bangladesh has zero tolerance policy towards terrorism, is the main basis on the basis of which we have been cooperating with our government and we are prepared to cooperate fully with the Government of India in our common drive to eradicate this particular menace,” Ali added.
When asked that India had decided to expose and isolate Pakistan globally and would Bangladesh join India in this endeavour, he said, “Both Bangladesh and India right now are engaged at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which is beginning Tuesday (today), and I think the General Assembly is the main forum where we voice all international concerns and we try to take joint action over there.
“Since my Prime Minister is already in New York and your Foreign Affairs Minister would also be there soon, I am sure there will be very high level of consultations, and we will act together at the UN.”
Asked what actions are required to be taken against terrorism, he said, “There are various options, which are on the table and Prime Minister Modi himself also considering various consequences and various implications of the various courses of action. So, it is quite possible that she (Prime Minister Hasina) might be able to take a comprehensive package of taking actions on several fronts. So, we will have to wait for a final decision to be taken on the matter, and then there will be high level consultations between us, but we are prepared to cooperate with India.”
Ali also expressed his deep condolences to the members of the bereaved families and whished wounded soldiers’ early and complete recovery."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a meeting on the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, where NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, Water Resources Secretary, and senior PMO officials were also present. In the wake of the Uri attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, there have been calls to repeal the treaty.
India-Pakistan relations took a hit after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July, and even more so after the terrorist attack on Uri base in Jammu and Kashmir by Jaish-e-Mohammed militants that killed 19 soldiers.

 
Last week, External Affairs Ministry Spokesman Vikas Swarup had told the media that “for any such treaty to work, you need mutual trust and goodwill. I will leave it at that”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Responding to a question from the media, Swarup had said last week that “it cannot be a one-sided affair”, adding that the government will rethink on the Treaty given the growing strain between the two countries. He also noted that the preamble of the Treaty itself said it was based on “goodwill”.

Condemning the terror attack on an army unit in Uri, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said Pakistan should be proclaimed a terror state and be isolated internationally.
“The time has come when it has become important to announce Pakistan as a terror state. The entire world should boycott Pakistan and should be announced as a country that promotes terrorism,” BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain told ANI.
Hussain said Pakistan has become danger, not only for India, but for the entire world and added that India has tried to maintain friendship several times with Islamabad but they are not worth being friends.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
BJP spokesperson Shaina NC, condemning the attack, told ANI, “It is time for the international world community to declare Pakistan a terror state and isolate them.”
“Our Prime Minister is amply clear that we will give a befitting reply; we will ensure that every perpetrator is caught,” she added.
At least 17 soldiers lost their lives and 19 others were injured during the terror strike on an army camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla district.
All four terrorists have been killed in what has emerged as worse than the attack on the Pathankot air base in January this year, in which seven army men were killed.
President Pranab Mukherjee, while condemning the terror attack, said India will not be cowed down by such attacks and will thwart the evil designs of all terrorists and their backers.
“Strongly condemn terrorist attack on Army base in #Uri; tributes to brave soldiers who made supreme sacrifice,” President Mukherjee said.

Combating cross-border terrorism and its supporters will be a key priority for BRICS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday announcing decisions taken by top leaders of the five-nation influential grouping at its annual summit. In his concluding remarks at the BRICS summit, Modi said it was agreed at the summit that those who nurture, shelter, support and sponsor forces of violence and terror are as much a “threat to us” as terrorists themselves and efforts must be speeded up to deal with the menace.

This is seen as a boost to India’s stand on the issue as it has been pitching for isolation of Pakistan for its ‘terror export’. Modi said the leaders were unanimous in recognising the threat that terror, extremism and radicalization present to regional and global peace, stability and economic prosperity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We underscored the need for close coordination on tracking sources of terrorist financing and target the hardware of terrorism, including weapons’ supplies, ammunition, equipment and training,” he said.
He said there was unanimity in recognising the threat that terrorism, extremism and radicalisation presents and BRICS leaders expressed commitment to strengthen consultations and cooperation on matters of security.
“We underscored the need for close coordination on tracking sources of terrorist financing,” he said. On key agenda of the grouping, Modi said putting the global economy back on track was another focus point of the deliberations, adding the discussions at the summit were “detailed, substantive and productive”.
The Prime Minister said there was deliberations on possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles, in order to further strengthen the global governance architecture.
Modi said the Goa declaration lays a comprehensive vision for cooperation within BRICS and international issues.
The Prime Minister said there was also a clear need to build norms, create structures and pool capacities to stop tax evasion, and fight against black money and corruption."

Pakistan on Sunday rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that it was exporting terror, saying the remarks were part of a well thought out vilification campaign to distract attention from Kashmir.
Pakistan Foreign Office, in a statement, said Prime Minister Modi in a public meeting in Kerala tried to malign Pakistan.
“It is unfortunate that Indian leadership continues to indulge in a well thought out vilification campaign against Pakistan by making provocative statements and baseless accusations. Such irresponsible display of behaviour at the highest political level is regrettable,” the Foreign Office said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“It is evident that, as an act of desperation, India is trying to distract world attention from the atrocities perpetrated” by its forces in Kashmir against “innocent and defenseless” Kashmiris, including children and women, the statement said.
The ‘atrocities’ in Kashmir intensified since the ‘extra-judicial killing of Kashmiri youth leader’ Burhan Muzaffar Wani in July this year, it said of the slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander.
Pakistan’s reaction came after Prime Minister Modi launched a blistering attack on it in his first public address after last Sunday’s deadly Uri terror attack.
Modi said the sacrifice of 18 soldiers will not go in vain while all out efforts will be made to isolate Pakistan globally.
“Terrorists should hear out clearly that India will never forget the Uri attack…I want to tell the leadership of Pakistan that the sacrifice of our 18 jawans will not go in vain,” Modi told a public meeting on the Kozhikode beach held on the sidelines of the BJP national council meet.
He said while countries in Asia are working to make the 21st century Asia’s, Pakistan is engaged in a conspiracy of causing bloodshed across the continent by sponsoring terrorism and killing innocents.
The Pakistan Foreign Office statement alleged, “In the last seventy-five days, Indian occupation forces have brutally martyred more than 100 Kashmiris, blinded hundreds and injured thousands.”
The Foreign Office claimed that the international community has taken notice of these “blatant human rights violations” with concerns expressed by several countries as well as UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
It also accused India of continuing to sponsor terrorism in Pakistan through state apparatus.
“The arrest and confession statements of a serving India Navy officer and intelligence operative, Kulbhushan Jadhav, reveal beyond a shadow of doubt as to how India fuels terrorist activities in various parts of Pakistan, including Balochistan and FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas),” the statement said."

On the intervening night of September 28-29, 2016, Indian Army carried out surgical strikes against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), just eleven days after the Uri attack which had claimed the lives of 18 soldiers. The army launched the attack targeting Pakistani terrorists positioned across the Line of Control. The then DGMO, Lt General Ranbir Singh, had announced on September 29 that India had conducted surgical strikes on terror pads along the LoC using ground forces and inflicted “significant casualties”.

What is a surgical strike?
A surgical strike is essentially a swift and targeted attack on a specific target that aims to neutralise them while ensuring minimum collateral damage to the surrounding areas and civilians. Neutralisation of targets with surgical strikes also prevents a situation from escalating to a full-blown war. Surgical strikes are part of India’s Cold Start doctrine and have proved effective in foiling infiltration attempts by terrorist groups across the LoC.
What was Pakistan’s reaction?
Pakistan, on September 30, 2016, rejected India’s claim that it had conducted surgical strikes on terrorist launch pads along LoC. It said that New Delhi is doing it only to please the media and public. In a statement, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said, “The Pakistani Army gave befitting response to the Indian army. Indian Army opened up small arms fire last night on five sectors across LoC. India is doing this under a well-planned objective. If India tries to do this again, we will respond forcefully. India is doing this only to please their media and public.”
Pakistan said at least two army personnel were killed in the exchange of fire between Pakistani and Indian troops.
The exchange of fire began at 2:30am, ISPR said, and continued till 8:00am. “Pakistani troops befittingly responded to Indian unprovoked firing on the LoC in Bhimber, Hotspring Kel and Lipa sectors,” a statement from Pakistan said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India, by conducting such operations along LoC, has succeeded in showing the world about the need to uproot the menace of terrorism. He said the September 29 surgical strikes prove that the country can defend itself when needed.
“When India talked of terrorism 20 years back, many in the world said it was a law and order problem and didn’t understand it. Now terrorists have explained terrorism to them so we don’t have to,” Modi said at a community reception at the Ritz Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia, in June last year.
Modi had also applauded the precision and tactical warfare of the army in eliminating terrorists across the LoC. Home Minister Rajnath Singh also tried to make it clear that security forces can cross over the Line of Control, if needed, to protect country’s territorial integrity.
In October 2016, the then urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu had rejected the Opposition’s demand for proof of the surgical strikes, saying that any further debate on the matter would be an “insult” to the Army. His remarks were reiterated by other union ministers who said that releasing the video was not necessary as the Army had already issued a statement on the strikes.
What was the opposition’s reaction?
Congress said that surgical strikes were conducted thrice during the party-led UPA rule but their government did not make loud claims in the interest of national security. “We are proud that even in the past our forces have successfully conducted such surgical strikes on numerous occasions, particularly on September 1, 2011, July 28, 2013 and January 14, 2014, giving a befitting reply to the enemy,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had said.
On the question of Pakistan’s denial on surgical strikes, Mr Surjewala said: “There has never been a reason to raise a question or doubt on the statements by DGMO on surgical strike. The government needs to call the Pakistani bluff and false propaganda by using all information, evidence and instruments at their disposal.”

However, the grand old party said that “on the issues of national security there can be no two opinions, despite political differences between Congress and BJP.”
Meanwhile, former finance minister P Chidambaram had raised concerns over the authenticity of surgical strikes and asked the government for proof. “UPA did PoK strikes too, but it is up to the present government to give proof of the surgical strikes. The much-hyped surgical strike on last Wednesday night was not the only time that Army had crossed the LoC to take punitive action,” he had said.
AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, while lauding the Army’s efforts, asked the government to release video footage of the strikes.
The latest: Surgical strikes video released
Video clips of September 29 operations across the LoC were broadcast on several TV channels on Wednesday, for the first time. These clips showed some terrorists being killed, besides destruction of bunkers and other military constructions. TV channels claimed these videos, which they had accessed from official sources, were taken by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Thermal Imaging (TI) cameras used by the Army to monitor the operation.
Lt General D S Hooda (retd), former Northern Army Commander who was directly in-charge of the surgical strikes told The Indian Express that the videos are real. The feed of these videos was reportedly being broadcast live during the surgical strikes to the operations room of his headquarters in Udhampur."

His first film as lead Uri: The Surgical Strike will test Vicky Kaushal’s commercial viability as a Bollywood actor and he says the box office collections are not an indicator to suggest whether a film is good or not.
The 30-year-old actor, however, believes that the numbers are important for the business.
“It is a privilege and an honour for me to reach a stage where you get an opportunity to be tested. I am glad I got this opportunity with such a credible subject. Box office numbers can’t decide whether it is a good film or not. But it is important, it is showbiz. A producer invests in a film and expects good return,” Vicky told PTI in an interview.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The actor had a great 2018 with back-to-back hits in Sanju, Raazi and Manmarziyaan among others and he hopes the trend continues in the New Year.
“In 2018, only the films that were good and appreciated did the numbers, irrespective of the cast and crew. The math has simplified a lot. If it is a good film, it will do the numbers,” he added.
Vicky said he enjoys prepping for the roles he plays.
“I love the prep time. The reaction or emotion comes from you and you realise it was there within you and it was untapped. This is the most beautiful part of this profession that you come to know about yourself and that is how you evolve not just as an actor but as a person.”
The actor underwent extensive military training for Uri, based on Indian Army’s surgical strikes across the LoC on Pakistan as a retaliation for the Uri attack in 2016.
“When you really prep a lot, it makes you think like the character subconsciously. You might be learning 20 different things for a film and you might be using just 10 out of it. All of the extra things are embedded in you on a subconscious level.
“Those are the things that make you think like that character. We create back-story for a character or an emotion even though it is not going to be part of the film, but it is for us to respond to a situation,” he said.
The actor said there is a lot of pressure and responsibility on the team to portray these stories correctly.
“We have tried our best to put out the story in the most honest way possible,” he added.
Vicky said he had conversations with people from the armed forces but as per the protocol, they were not allowed to interact with those who led the strike in real life.
“We could not meet those who were involved in surgical strikes but we met para-commandos who are trained for such strikes and have been part of covert missions in the past but not this one.
“It was all about understanding their psyche and headspace before, during and after the mission. It was interesting to know their human side like how they face their fears,” he said.
It is ironic that the actor played Iqbal Syed, a Pakistani Army major in Raazi and in Uri he is playing Major Vihaan Shergill, a commander-in-chief, who led the surgical strike.
Drawing similarities between them, Vicky said, both are patriots but in a different milieu.
Asked to comment on Naseeruddin Shah’s video interview that a cow’s death was being given more importance than that of a cop, Vicky said he is not aware about the veteran actor’s remarks in detail but believes everyone’s opinion must be respected.
“He said it with his honesty. He is a proud citizen of this country and it is coming out of care and love for this country. He should be heard and not attacked. We need to hear out and respect each other’s opinion, otherwise it is not a democratic country,” the actor said.
“I feel a human causing harm to another human is a very sad state. It is something we need to introspect, question. Lynching is something I would say is wrong. We are part of a democratic country but that doesn’t mean we take law in our hands. Law has to step forward to see such incidents don’t happen,” he added.
Uri also features Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam and popular TV actor Mohit Raina among others.
Produced by Ronnie Screwvala’s RSVP, the film is slated to release on January 11."

Filmmaker Karan Johar has refuted reports that Pakistani actor Fawad Khan would feature in the first episode of the upcoming fifth season of Koffee With Karan.
The director has begun shooting for the season, which is expected to air next month. Fawad, who starred in Johar’s production Kapoor & Sons and has a cameo in his upcoming directorial venture Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, was widely rumoured to be the first guest on the celebrity talk show.
When asked about it, Johar said, “No. I haven’t yet reached the combination (of stars appearing on the season). There have been a lot of conjectures about that but we are zeroing-in on episode one and we will announce it soon.” The director was speaking at a session of Jagran Film Festival here last evening.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Fawad and Johar have been amid tensions lately after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena demanded the ouster of Pakistani artistes from the film industry in the wake of Uri attack. Recently, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association also announced the ban on the actors and technicians from the neighbouring country till things don’t get normal between the two nations.
Meanwhile, when asked what new is his show going to offer, Johar said, “There’s nothing new. It’s the same lot (of stars) with new combinations. We haven’t created many stars since the last season so, there’s nothing new. Luckily, they have new lovers, enemies and controversies!”"

On India’s diplomatic efforts to isolate Pakistan following the Uri attack, he said, “How on earth it is possible to isolate a country on terrorism when that country itself is the worst victim of terrorism?”
He called for sustained diplomacy to forge an “effective cooperative paradigm” to improve ties. “We need to move from symbolism to substance and from conflict management to conflict resolution,” Basit said.
He said the issue of Jammu & Kashmir was the “root cause” of all problems between the two countries and Pakistan does not need “misplaced jingoism and hyper-nationalism” to pursue its foreign policy objectives."

The details of casualties on the Pakistani side in the sector were being ascertained. However, there were no casualties or damage on the Indian side, the spokesman said and added troops were maintaining a high degree of alertness all along the LoC.
He also said that at least 17 Pakistani soldiers were killed as alert Indian troops foiled their attempt to capture the Faulad post on this side of the LoC in Gulmarg sector last night. The Pakistani attack came around 6.30 pm, which was followed by intense artillery and mortar shelling.
The Indian Army retaliated, forcing the enemy to retreat after suffering heavy casualties in the form of men and material. Meanwhile, the Commissioner-Secretary Tourism, Parvez Dewan, advised tourists in Gulmarg to avoid trekking to distant places like Kungdori and Lienmarg."

The family of Subedar Baldev Kumar Sharma, a jawan of 29-Assam Rifles who was killed in Chandel district of south Manipur during a militant ambush in May 2016, on Tuesday alleged injustice and apathy on part of the Himachal Pradesh government and Central government.
Speaking to media persons at Shimla Press Club, his 25-year-old son Vivek Kumar Sharma said: “I just want to know from our government (both state and centre), if the contribution of my father really deserves to be equated as balidan (martyrdom) for the nation. If yes, why there is a distinction of uniform and status?”
Sharma also added that after the Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said that all martyrs, whether from the army or paramilitary forces, will be given equal treatment. However, he said, there was nothing on record or no notification issued by the Central government to fulfil this promise.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sharma also showed a letter he received from Ministry of Defence (MOD) dated December 2016 which stated: “Word martyr is not used in reference to any of the casualties in the Indian Armed Forces, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles (AR), who are killed in action or any other operation.”
Meanwhile, he also alleged that the state government too did not fulfil its promises made to them. He said that the Minister for Social Justice, Col (Rtd) Dhani Ram Shandil, had promised a compensation of Rs 5 Lakh for the family, a job and naming of a local school in Shah Talai on his father’s name but they went back on the promises.
“I am in a desperate need of a job as I have to look after my mother and younger sister. It’s not my own battle, it’s a fight for justice to the families of the martyrs who have lost their sole bread earners. We are called martyr’s kin only at the time of their death but later the struggle is tough,” he said.
Subedar Baldev Kumar Sharma is survived by son Vivek Kumar Sharma, daughter Priyanka(22) and wife Aruna Devi."

(Source: ANI)
In a veiled attack on Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said there’s anger in India post the Uri attack, where 18 soldiers sacrificed their lives after our neighbour exported terrorists there.
Addressing the BJP national conclave in Kozhikode, PM Modi said, “There is only one country in Asia that indulges in terrorism and exporting it around the world. Terrorism is humanity’s enemy and India will never forget the 18 martyred soldiers who were killed by terrorists in Uri.”
“Terrorists should hear out clearly that India will never forget the Uri attack…. I want to tell the leadership of Pakistan that the sacrifice of our 18 jawans will not go in vain,” Modi said on the sidelines of the BJP national council meet.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Be it Afghanistan, Bangladesh or other nations, we have seen whenever the news of terror incidents comes, terrorists have either gone from this country (Pakistan) or have settled there after committing the crime,” he said.

The Prime Minister said India had never bowed to terror and will never do so in future and will strive to defeat it.
PM Modi also slammed Pakistan saying that the country cannot handle PoK, Gilgit and Balochistan, which are already under it’s control. “A day will come when people of Pakistan will go against its own government to fight terrorism,” he added. He also directly appealed to Pakistani citizens saying that India was ready to fight for them if they have the strength to join the fight against poverty.

The Uri attacks issue dominated the first day of three-day BJP conclave. A militant attack on an army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, has claimed the lives of eighteen soldiers. While 17 soldiers died on Sunday, the army confirmed that one more critically injured soldier succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, pushing the death toll to 18.
The armed militants lobbed grenades into their tents and barracks, while the soldiers were sleeping. The ensuing fire led to a large number of casualties. Twenty-eight injured soldiers are being treated at a military hospital."

Giving credit to the teachings of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said Monday that a Prime Minister from the land of Mahatma Gandhi and a defence minister from Goa were a “different kind-of combination” that backed the Indian Army in carrying out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC).

Speaking at a “Know Your Army” event organised at the Nirma University campus, Parrikar said, “I wonder that a Prime Minister from land of Mahatma Gandhi and a defence minister from Goa and surgical strikes… maybe the RSS teachings was there, but this was very different kind of a combination.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said both Prime Minister and he have been facing a tough situation when people began questioning them after the Uri attacks. “After 18 soldiers were martyred in Uri we had to face a lot of difficult situations. Till the 29th of September, the Prime Minister was targeted on the social media and in other media. Some share of the criticism was also directed towards me,” Parrikar added.
Criticising “some politicians” for seeking proof, the defence minister equated them with his own grandmother. “Some people have been seeking proof (of surgical strikes)…. When America sent the first human to moon, my 72-year-old grandmother did not believe it. She asked for proof. When photographs were shown to her, she still did not believe it. She was never convinced till her death… Some people will never get convinced even if solid proof is given.. When Indian Army does something we should remember that this is one of the world’s best, professional, brave and an army with high integrity,” he told an audience largely consisting of students and faculty members.
Narrating the exploits of the Indian Army in World War-II, Parrikar said, “This is my Army. I do not need any proof when they say something. In this country there was a lethargic attitude as far as security of the country

was concerned. Two good things have happened due to the surgical strikes. Except for few politicians, I see every Indian rising in unison and standing behind our brave soldiers. Secondly, there is increased sensitivity regarding national security.”
Talking about the “Make in India” campaign, the defence minister called on the engineering students to associate themselves with the campaign. “Buying foreign goods may look attractive. When there is no option we have to buy.

But, many items we need to manufacture ourselves, because if there is a war anytime, we should be prepared,” he said at the event where Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and General Office Commanding of Golden Katar

Division Major General SK Parashar were also present.
When quizzed about the continuing cease-fire violations by Pakistan on the Indo-Pak border, Parrikar told mediapersons, “Cease-fire violations have taken place in hundreds since the last five-six years, you can check out the

figures. The only difference is that if they do it now, we give them a befitting reply.” Parrikar’s comments came a day after a jawan was killed in firing by Pakistani troops in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir.
Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani too praised the surgical strikes carried out by the Indian Army. “Gujarat is a border state that share both land and sea boundaries with Pakistan. We need to be more alert. Instructions have been given to the local administration to provide all help to the armed forces,” Rupani said during his speech.”"

Let this line be added,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.
The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed a resolution congratulating the Army and the political leadership including Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the LoC, but the exercise too had its share of AAP-BJP tussle.
The Assembly, dominated by Aam Aadmi Party, has often seen sharp attacks by the ruling party on Modi, whose name was on Friday included in the resolution following a demand by Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Vijender Gupta. BJP has just three MLAs in the 70-member House. The resolution in its original form did not refer to any individual.

“We congratulate the Prime Minister, the Centre, the Union Home Minister, the Defence Minister and the chiefs of the armed forces. Let this line be added,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said. The resolution, introduced by Kejriwal and passed unanimously, also condemned the Uri attacks in which 19 soldiers were killed and warned Pakistan to desist from repeating such “misadventures” in the future. It also extended wholehearted support to measures to be taken by the Union government for protecting the country’s territorial integrity and demanded that rogue elements responsible for causing hardship to the common people of the subcontinent be “isolated”.
Earlier, Gupta said the resolution had certain shortcomings and demanded that Modi’s name be inserted as even the Army Chief has “praised the political leadership”. Gupta also urged Kejriwal to delete his September 27 tweet that read “Excellent article. On Uri, rather than Pak, India seems to be getting isolated internationally.” The CM had shared an opinion piece on Indo-Pak tensions following the Uri attack.

“The tweet was made when the forces were on their way to the mission. It will have a negative impression when the world has focused its attention towards India,” Gupta said. Ministers including Sisodia, Kapil Mishra and Gopal Rai participated in a brief discussion on the resolution."

It has been more than a year that India bid adieu to Fawad Khan. But not a single ounce of his stardom or fan base has faded on this side of the border. The irresistible Khan from Pakistan bowled over the Indians with just two films – Khoobsurat and Kapoor And Sons, an extended cameo in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and his blockbuster television shows Humsafar, Zindagi Gulzar Hai and Dastan. The man who is held responsible for sweeping an entire generation off their feet with his intense acting, never-ending charm and an unmatched persona turns 36 today.
Just when we thought Fawad had found his way through the stardom of Bollywood, he had to hurriedly return to his country owing to certain political disturbances. His massive fans base was left yearning. The Pakistani heartthrob has gone back to his country and work too. Though we are unsure whether or not he will ever return to India and Hindi film industry, but his followers in India surely await him with open arms.
So, what has Fawad Khan been busy with, ever since he left Bollywood and India? We get to see flashes of his work and personal life through whatever trickles down from the Pakistani media. Here, we present all that Fawad did in the last one year, and all that’s in store from his side. Read on.
1. Fawad Khan became a father again
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone wp-image-4476932 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/elayna.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""885"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/elayna.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/elayna.jpg?resize=386,450 386w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/elayna.jpg?resize=515,600 515w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/elayna.jpg?resize=347,405 347w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Weeks after he flew back to Pakistan, news broke that Fawad became a proud father to a baby girl. Fawad’s manager Hassan Khalid personally confirmed the news to the Pakistani media. Fawad and his wife sadaf named the little one – Elayna.
2. Fawad and Mahira Khan return to the screens

The dreamy duo recreated their Humsafar magic, but a little differently this time. Fawad and Mahira got into some sensuous chemistry in a Lux advertisement. Though the TVC was released before Fawad left India, but its video began trending again. Blame it on the love of their fans?
3. Fawad turns an endorsement king
Fawad began endorsing brands left right and centre. From a deodorant brand to an automobile, a soft drink and even a snacking brand, he did it all. And he sizzled in every TVC leaving his female fans going gaga not just in Pakistan, but India too.
	
	
		
			

	
	
		
			

	
	
		
			

	
	
		
			
4. Fawad candid photos with his daughter did the rounds
Fawad was captured sharing a candid moment with his three-month-old daughter. This was during the birthday party of his elder son Ayaan who turned seven. Amid all the cake cutting and celebrations, Fawad and Elayna’s pics stole hearts.

5. Fawad’s new beefed up look
One fine day in February 2017, the internet got buzzing with a handful of new clicks of Fawad. But this time, eyes were popping after seeing the actor’s new beefed up body. It was reported that Fawad underwent transformation for his upcoming film Maula Jatt 2. One particular picture was shared by Pakistani actor Mikaal Zulfiqar on Facebook. For someone who is known as a boy-next-door, this was surely an unchartered territory.
	
	
		
			
6. The Humsafar actors are captured again
The more we see Fawad and Mahira together, the more we wish they had never left India. Fawad was captured in the same frame while promoting Mahira’s Pakistani film Hoh Mann Jahaan ahead of its world TV premiere on March 23. Mahira herself tweeted the picture, which also had other Pakistani actors Adeel Hussain and Sheheryar Munawar.

7. Fawad rings in wife Sadaf’s birthday
Get jealous or not, but it isn’t unknown that Fawad and Sadaf have a fairytale love story. From childhood sweethearts to life partners, these two have come a long way. Fawad made news again while celebrating Sadaf’s birthday and their candid photos broke the internet again.

8. Fawad and Sadaf have their most intimate photoshoot
Family man Fawad keeps his personal life to himself. The shy actor however did an adorable and intimate photoshoot with his real-life ‘co-star’. The clicks from the magazine shoot soon flooded the fan pages and kept trending for days.

9. Fawad appears in a new TVC
This was a gift for all those who missed seeing him in action. Fawad might have been on a hiatus from the silver screen, but his latest Pakistani TVC made us miss him more. While it was just a commercial, his acting raised it to another level. The new ad for a Pakistan-based property website was about a son giving his parents a surprise when he buys them a house.
	
	
		
			
10. Fawad sings at Pepsi Battle of the Bands
The best part about this two month long musical battle between bands, was when Fawad reunited with his band, Entity Paradigm (EP). We know that the actor rose to fame with his rock band EP, which was discovered at Pepsi’s mega music venture itself. The project is seen to be in competition with Coca Cola’s Coke Studio.
	
	
		
			
Fawad took over the stage amid strumming guitars as nostalgic fans cheered loudly. He sang the raw version of his own song “Hamesha” and proved why he is not just a handsome face.

11. Fawad’s candid clicks with his family
Everytime he appears, he steals hearts, be it as a husband, a father or as a complete family man. This time, Fawad was captured with wife Sadaf, his son Ayaan and daughter Elayna at a fashion event.

12. Fawad turns model for his clothing brand
Flaunting his true Pathani side, Fawad shot for the brand in traditional wear. Fawad owns the clothing line titled ‘Silk’ along with his wife. And who better than he himself to model for the company?

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma is inching closer to its release and facing new rumours every day. The latest is that censor board has cut three ‘intimate’ scenes from the film despite director Karan Johar’s protests.

According to the rumours, the scenes which have been chopped have Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in close proximity. However, Dharma has denied the news and said the film has been passed without any cut, intimate or otherwise. A reliable source from Dharma Productions has slashed every rumour saying that no changes are being made in the film. “There are no cuts being made to the film. No changes of any sort, as being reported. The film will release on October 28,” said the source.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, there was speculation that Karan Johar might tweak the scenes featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan or might replace him with Saif Ali Khan after the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) threatened to stop the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in Maharashtra in the aftermath of Uri attack. However, the source confirmed that this is not the case. “Fawad is not being replaced,” the source said.
The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issued fresh threats on Monday (October 10) to filmmakers Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt, saying that they would beat them up if they continue to work with Pakistani artists. Earlier the party had demanded that Johar should Fawad Khan’s scenes from the film.

MNS party, following the Uri attack that killed 19 Indian soldiers, issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave the country and threatened they won’t let any Bollywood films with Pakistani actors release. Following that, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution to avoid working with Pakistani artistes until bilateral tensions between the two countries subside.
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the lead roles and Fawad Khan in a pivotal role, is just two weeks away from its release. The film, which releases on Diwali, October 28 this year, faces a box-office clash with Shivaay starring Ajay Devgn."

The CM said in an official statement that while minister in-charge of the district of Kaimur and Gaya would be present at the cremation of Rakesh Singh and S K Vidyarthi respectively, the funeral of Ashok Kumar Singh in Ara would be attended by Industries minister Jai Kumar Singh.
Kumar expressed deep sorrow over the terror attack that left 1 8 jawans dead.
“The country will always remember their martyrdom,” the CM said.
He prayed to the Almighty to provide strength to the family of the martyred soldiers and said the entire state was with them in this hour of grief.
Meanwhile, sorrow descended at the native villages of the three soldiers with their family and neighbours demanding a matching and stern action against Pakistan for this dastardly act.

In a sharp riposte to Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s charge that New Delhi was running a campaign of subversion and state-sponsored terrorism against Islamabad, India on Friday described Pakistan as “Terroristan” and “land of pure terror”, at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday. At the UNGA last year, India had called Pakistan the “Ivy League of terrorism”. Like last year, India’s reply was given by Eenam Gambhir, a 2005-batch diplomat in New York.
“In its short history, Pakistan has become a geography synonymous with terror. The quest for a ‘land of pure’ (Pakistan means the land of the pure) has actually produced ‘the land of pure terror’. Pakistan is now ‘Terroristan’, with a flourishing industry producing and exporting global terrorism,” said Gambhir, reading from a prepared text: “It is extraordinary that the state which protected Osama bin Laden and sheltered Mullah Omar should have the gumption to play the victim. By now, all Pakistan’s neighbours are painfully familiar with these tactics to create a narrative based on distortions, deception and deceit,” she said.
Emboldened by the US, Japan, BRICS and Heart of Asia naming Lashkar-e-Taiba in joint statements, she said: “Its current state can be gauged from the fact that Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, a leader of the UN-designated terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, is now sought to be legitimised as a leader of a political party.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Referring to the recent election in Pakistan where a candidate backed by Hafiz Saeed got over 40,000 votes, she said: “This is a country whose counter-terrorism policy is to mainstream and upstream terrorists by either providing safe havens to global terror leaders in its military town, or protecting them with political careers… None of this can justify Pakistan’s avaricious efforts to covet the territories of its neighbours. In so far as India is concerned, Pakistan must understand that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is, and will always remain, an integral part of India. However much its scales up cross-border terrorism, it will never succeed in undermining India’s territorial integrity.”

“We also heard Pakistan complain about the consequences of its supposed counter-terrorism efforts. Having diverted billions of dollars in international military and development aid towards creating a dangerous infrastructure of terror on its own territory, Pakistan is now speaking of the high cost of its terror industry. The polluter, in this case, is paying the price,” said Gambhir.
This comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s new South Asia strategy, which has hit out at Pakistan and has, in recent weeks, tried to squeeze funding, unless visible action is taken against terrorist outfits. Calling Pakistan a “failed state”, Gambhir said, “Even as terrorists thrive in Pakistan and roam its streets with impunity, we have heard it lecture about the protection of human rights in India. The world does not need lessons on democracy and human rights from a country whose own situation is charitably described as a failed state.”
“Terroristan is in fact a territory whose contribution to the globalisation of terror is unparalleled. Pakistan can only be counseled to abandon a destructive worldview that has caused grief to the entire world. If it could be persuaded to demonstrate any commitment to civilisation, order, and peace, it may still find some acceptance in the comity of nations,” she said.
In September 2016, while responding to then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Gambhir had said at the UNGA that “the land of Taxila, one of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, is now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts aspirants and apprentices from all over the world.”

Addressing the UNGA on Friday, Pakistan Prime Minister Abbasi said that Islamabad had offered dialogue with New Delhi on all thorny issues, especially over Kashmir. “Pakistan remains open to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with India to address all outstanding issues, especially Kashmir, and discuss measures to maintain peace and security,” he said. “This dialogue must be accompanied by an end to India’s campaign of subversion and state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan, including from across our western border,” he said.
In its statement at the UNGA on Friday, Afghanistan also hit out at Pakistan for sheltering terrorists — Osama bin Laden, Mullah Umar, Mullah Akhtar Mansour.
Last year, after the Uri attack, India had resorted to naming and shaming Pakistan at various international fora. In October 2016, at the BRICS summit in Goa, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called it the “mothership of terrorism” and said “terrorism is Pakistan’s favourite child”. Indian officials said that traditionally, Pakistan was always described as a country which uses terrorism as an instrument of state policy. Over the last decade, it has often been described as the “epicentre of terrorism”.
Officials recalled Pakistan being called an “international migraine which can be cured by India” by US Secretary of State Madeline Albright. While referring to Pakistan hobnobbing with terrorists, Hillary Clinton, as US Secretary of State, had said: “You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.”"

His movies have had political undertones and have often run into some trouble but filmmaker Rahul Dholakia says his intention behind Raees was to make a controversy-free film. Dholakia’s film Parzania, about a missing boy in Gujarat riots, had to face an unofficial ban in the state owing to it’s topic during its release. His follow up film Lamha was set in Kashmir and explored the story of an intelligence agent investigating people responsible for the extremist attacks there. “Raees has got less politics because I wanted to make a non-controversial film,” Dholakia says about the crime- thriller, set in 1980s Gujarat.

“That was a decision I made. The film does have undertones of politics but I thought why fight so much for every film, let’s take a break and do something non-controversial. But I didn’t know it will get into a controversy,” Dholakia told PTI in an interview.
The film tells the story of bootlegger Raees Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) whose business is challenged and eventually thwarted by a police officer played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The film, however, did run into a controversy owing to its Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, whose presence in the film was opposed by MNS after the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“You don’t intend to make a controversial film, that’s not the agenda. Who wants it? It’s not worth it with regards to health, money, and risk. But when it becomes controversial, you have to defend your film,” the director says. Though Parzania had to face severe issues, the film eventually bagged the National Award.
When asked if one can make a film on politics sans any controversy, Dholakia says, “I doubt. It will be a bit difficult now, especially because of the social media. If you

really want to make a political film, just get off social media for sometime. Don’t let that affect you.” Raees is scheduled to release on January 25, exactly a decade after Prazania hit the screens on January 26, 2007.
“It is an amazing coincidence. When I got to know, I said ‘wow’ this is an uncanny conincidence,” Dholakia says. The director feels his journey has been good so far but says his only complaint is that he takes too much time to make films. “I take too much time to make my films because I do a lot of research, re-writes. I really enjoyed the journey of ‘Raees’. Somewhere, it is similar to Parzania because the spirit of making it is independent, though it is not an indie film. Everybody is involved in the film.

“While working on Raees, we all became a film just like the cast and crew during Parzania. So the spirit has taken over. Though Raees is a commercial, popular film with punches and all, it retains the spirit with which I began. I feel very satisfied.”"

The Bihar government announced a sum of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the martyrs from that state who lost their lives in the Uri attack. Their announcement, hower, drew a lot of flak for the ‘meagre’ amount they offered. Suneeta, widow of Hav Ashok Kumar Singh, refused the compensation and asked, “Was my husband a drunkard who died in a drain?” The compensation was then revised to Rs 11 lakh.
Now, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced a sum of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of martyrs, and people on social media are enraged. Many dug out reports from September 2015 when Banerjee, or Didi as she’s popularly known, had announced Rs 10 lakh for a pilgrim from her state who lost his life in the Mecca crash accident and Rs 1 lakh each for other the 100 deceased.
“Mamata gives 2 lakhs for Uri Attack martyrs. Same Mamata gave 10 lakhs for victims who were killed in Hajj accident. Long live secularism!” wrote a user.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It’s not just West Bengal and Bihar government who have announced compensation for the martyrs. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced a sum of Rs 20 lakh each to the families of four martyrs from the state and Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubir Das also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each.
But Twitterati are visibly annoyed with the money offered to the soldiers’ families who lost their life for the country.
Take a look at these.

Headmen of four villages on the Line of Control have been questioned as part of a probe into the terror attack on an Army camp in Uri where 18 soldiers were killed Sunday. The probe gaze has also turned to vacant prefabricated shelters near the LoC where the terrorists are suspected to have stayed briefly before the assault.
Residents and headmen of Sukhdar, Gohalan, Jabla and Salamabad near the LoC have been questioned. The area which houses the headquarters of the 12 Infantry Brigade is fortified and has a strong network of human intelligence assets.

The prefabricated shelters, installed for area residents whose homes were damaged in the 2005 earthquake, are also being given a hard look. These shelters, which were later abandoned by villagers and used as temporary shelters for cattle, are not very far from the LoC. It is suspected that the terrorists stayed in one such shelter after crossing the LoC.
A J&K government official said villagers who were questioned said some among them claimed to have seen some men in military uniform Saturday evening — the attack took place at dawn Sunday — and assumed they were Army personnel. But these statements, the official underlined, are claims and will need further corroboration."

I also thank Pahlaj Nihalani for his support and Colors channel for agreeing not to take any Pakistani artists in Comedy Nights Bachao and Bigg Boss. I thank Radio Mirchi for supporting us and stopping Atif Aslam’s program. The day Pakistan stops terrorist attacks only then will we extend our hand of friendship.

Remaining firm on their earlier stance of stalling the release of every movie starring Pakistani artists, Amey said, “We have no enmity with either Karan Johar or Shah Rukh Khan. Our issue is with the Pakistani artists. Pakistani actors condemned and expressed sympathy when Paris attacks happened. But what about Uri attacks? We will protest every Indian film that has Pakistani actors in it. We will not allow such films to release. In Pakistan, our channels are banned. You all know what happened with director Kabir Khan in Pakistan. The same happened during one of Sonu Nigam’s shows there. We thank Raju Shrivastava and Abhijeet for cancelling their shows. Our protest is strong and many have tried to contact us but there will be no compromise from our end.”

Reiterating her earlier position, Shalini Thackeray general secretary of MNS Chitrapat Karamchari Sena said, “We thank people for all their support. However, with the return of Fawad Khan, our protest hasn’t ended. We won’t allow any Pakistani actors or players to work here. We won’t allow Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil to release. Whoever is supporting Karan Johar, be it Varun Dhawan or Sushant Singh, where were they when jawans were dying? After Uri attacks, the government didn’t do anything. The moment we said ban Pakistani actors, sympathy has started flowing in. Also this news about Salman Khan having called up Raj Thackeray is false.”

Shalini also thanked people for supporting the party’s stand against Pakistani actors. “Seventy percent people on social media have supported us.

We have also sent a letter to Red Chillies in this matter.”"

Denying Pakistan involvement in Uri terror attack that claimed 19 Indian soldiers lives, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday said that he wants and peace and aims to resolve all issues including Kashmir peacefully.
Addressing a joint session of the Parliament convened to discuss the security situation in the wake of increasing Indo-Pak tensions, Sharif accused India of running away from dialogue and instead creating a war-like environment by blaming Pakistan for the Uri terror attack.

“Within hours of Uri Attack and without any investigation, India blamed Pakistan for it. We are against war, we want peace and want to resolve all issues including Kashmir peacefully,” said Sharif.
Responding to Modi’s speech last month challenging Pakistan to a contest over eradicating poverty and other social ills, Sharif said, “If they (Indian leaders) want us to fight them to end poverty, then they should realise that poverty cannot be eradicated by driving tanks on farmlands.”
The Pakistan Prime Minister also accused India of violating the LoC ceasefire agreement and launching “aggression” against Pakistan. “India’s ceasefire violation resulted in the death of our two soldiers, when it attacked Pakistan. It was befittingly responded and was conveyed that Pakistan Army is fully capable to respond to any aggression,” he said.

Sharif also expressed support for Kashmiris and said the issue should be resolved according to the wishes of people of Kashmir and the UN resolutions. “The Kashmiri youth have taken it upon themselves to carry on the movement of freedom against Indian aggression and atrocities,” Sharif said.
He again mentioned Wani in his speech. “The death of Burhan Wani, son of the Kashmiri soil, had reminded India to give Kashmiris their right to self-determination,” Sharif said.
Raking up Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, Sharif had called Wani a “young leader”, evoking a strong reaction from India.
After the Uri attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the nation that those behind the ‘despicable’ attack will not go unpunished. Keeping Modi’s promise, the Indian forces conducted surgical strikes at the terror launchpads across the LoC on Thursday night, inflicting heavy causalities.
Days after India’s surgical strikes, there have been seven or more attempts by terrorists to attack Indian locations, including Akhnoor and Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir and Gurdaspur in Punjab.
The tally of ceasefire violations, unprovoked firing and terrorist attacks in Kashmir has exceeded twenty five. All attacks have been beaten back and by the Indian Army and the Border Security Force (BSF).

The top brass of the BJP and the government were aware that “action will be taken” days after the Uri attack but details of the surgical strike were kept under wraps until after it was over — and came as news to most members of the Cabinet Committee on Security when they met yesterday, sources have told The Indian Express.
A source close to Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that in a meeting on September 24 “broad details of targeting terrorists” were discussed with members. But operational details of the strike, a top government source said, were known only to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Army Chief General Dalbir Singh and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.

“The strike has sent the clear message that the Modi government is not your usual government. We are not orthodox, the Prime Minister doesn’t go by the dos and don’ts of conventional diplomacy,” a top BJP leader told The Indian Express yesterday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Indeed, Modi’s speech at Kozhikode calling for a war against poverty was a message from the people of India to the people of Pakistan and the strike on terror pads on Thursday was between the Indian Army and the Pak Army, the BJP leader said explaining the unfolding strategy of the Government in the wake of the unprecedented surgical strike on Thursday.
A top government source said that according to the Indian Army’s estimate, “casualties are substantial and if and when photographs and videos are released, the Army will be able to buttress the claim of success.” An official who has watched the film of the operations says its impact was “huge.”
Right now, though, the government believes that any premature release of pictures or videos can complicate the post-strike situation.
Another development being watched very carefully here is Pakistan Army chief Raheel Sharif’s retirement scheduled for later this year. The view in the government is that this puts pressure on the Pak security establishment to come up with a response to the first ever strike since 1971 that India has admitted to. That Pakistan is in a denial mode, sources said, helps it to buy some time to plan its response.
“No country will blame India for not trying enough. The Prime Minister went to Lahore and after the Pathankot attack, we allowed ISI men to inspect. What more by way of peace overtures can India show to win Pakistan’s trust?” asked a top government source.
Asked about a possible retaliation from Pakistan and pressure on India from US and China, the government source said: “Of course, we have taken into account these things but we have responded to the Indian people’s desire. India is celebrating the Army’s action. How long can a country of 1.2 billion be at the receiving end and take hits from Pakistan without raising a finger? Kitna maar khaye hum?”
Asked about the Kozhikode speech and its apparent mismatch with a surgical strike barely days later, the top party leader said: “What has happened at the border is between the Indian army and Pakistan army. When we suffer from terrorism, we have to plan counter-terrorism. What Modi talked about in Kerala are pressing issues for both countries that touch people.”
Incidentally, BJP president Amit Shah had discussed the Uri attack and its political fall-out with Modi and his party colleagues before he left for Kerala to attend the party’s national executive. After the strike, he called a meeting of BJP spokespersons and told them to “moderate” their responses. Shah and Parrikar refused to speak to the media and BJP avoided a press conference that day. The message to all to was to “underplay” the operation, a signal that the government is treading cautiously given the possibility of a Pakistan response."

Pakistani Defence Minister rejected India’s claim of carrying out surgical strikes, deep in its territory on Thursday morning. Speaking to ARY News, the country’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed the strikes were just “routine border skirmishes”. “I am denying it (surgical strikes), it is like any other border or control line violation,” he said.
He claimed that there was ceasefire violation at five locations along the Line of Control and two soldiers were killed in the strikes. “There was a violation at five locations, they (India) did not use any big weapons just mortars. Two soldiers were killed,” Asif said.
Claiming that in the last two years India had violated the 2003 ceasefire agreement at least 30-40 times, Asif told ARY News that 13 Pakistani soldiers were killed in action.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Asif also claimed that no evidence was handed by Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar to Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit on Uri attack. Indian probe agencies, earlier this week, revealed that the origins of the Uri attack indicates the four terrorists received help from across the border. They also identified one of the attackers and two guides, all residents of Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The defence minister also alleged that India is trying to put the Kashmir issue on back-burner.
Meanwhile, Pakistani Foreign Secretary on Thursday evening summoned the Indian High Commissioner and reiterated the official claim that the “so-called surgical strikes” are untrue. He condemned the alleged “unprovoked firing” by the Indian Army that killed two Pakistani Army personnel along the Line of Control.
The statement came after the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and the Defence Ministry in a joint statement announced that the Indian Army had carried out multiple surgical strikes in various locations along the Line of Control late on Wednesday night.
India’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh announced that Indian Army had carried out multiple surgical strikes in the wake of the infiltration bids by terrorists along the Line of Control (LoC), including at Uri and Poonch earlier this month.
“Indian Army conducted surgical strikes on terror launch pads on the LoC and significant casualties have been caused,” he said adding that the Indian forces have foiled over 20 infiltration bids in the past week."

Ministry of External Affairs on Tuesday announced that in wake of the strained relations with Pakistan following the terror attack in Uri, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to skip the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Islamabad in November.
“India has conveyed to current SAARC Chair Nepal that increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of Member States by one country have created an environment that is not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016,” External Affairs Ministry said in a statement.

“In the prevailing circumstances, the Government of India is unable to participate in the proposed Summit in Islamabad,” it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We also understand that some other SAARC Member States have also conveyed their reservation about attending the Islamabad Summit in November 2016,” it said.
According to sources, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan are the other countries which have said no to attending the Summit.

In its communication to Nepal, India has said it remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in an atmosphere free of terror.
The decision to boycott the SAARC Summit comes as India has been stepping up its diplomatic offensive against Pakistan over the past few days, over the latter’s open backing of the Kashmir unrest and also after the terror attack on an army camp in Uri on September 18 that left 18 soldiers dead.
Days after Prime Minister Modi announced that the sacrifices of the Indian soldiers in Uri would not go waste, the government decided to revisit the 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan and maximise its own utilisation of waters of three upstream rivers that were being used by Pakistan.
India is also working to revoke the Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan in trade and Modi is to hold a meeting on the issue on Thursday.
The announcement to boycott the SAARC summit comes as India has been unsparing in its attack, at the United Nations General Assembly, on Pakistan for sponsoring terror. India has also announced on the floor of the world body that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and will remain so.

Amid the clamour from cadres for a strong retaliation against Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack, BJP president Amit Shah on Friday told party leaders that they should focus on delivering on the promises on which the party rode to power. “It is time to deliver now. There is no time to sleep,” Shah was quoted as saying. He was addressing office-bearers at a meeting of the BJP national executive in Kozhikode ahead of the National Council meet.
Shah did not refer to Pakistan during his speech. The BJP, however, maintained that the government would keep building pressure on Pakistan on the issue of terrorism and work on isolating the country internationally. Asked if the party had toned down its rhetoric on Pakistan, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said: “You want a statement or action? Action will continue to happen. Wait and watch.” Madhav had earlier suggested a “complete jaw for one tooth” policy for the neighbouring country.

BJP leaders said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to refer to Pakistan during a public rally Saturday. His speech will indicate the government’s stance on the Uri attack. His speech at the rally, as well as his address at the concluding session of the conclave launching Deendayal Upadhyay’s birth centenary celebrations, will be watched live by party workers across the country.

During the national executive meeting — at which BJP leaders discussed the draft of the political resolution to be taken up in the National Council meeting and the Upadhyay centenary celebrations — Shah said there was no time to lose. “From being a small party in 1967, see what the BJP has become. We have come to power on the basis of our ideology and the promises we made. It is time to deliver on them now,” he was quoted as saying by a party leader.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The leaders were asked to focus on taking welfare schemes to the poor. “This is the first time the National Council is devoting a lot of time to discuss government programmes,” said Madhav.
Although Uri and Pakistan dominated corridor conversations, officially BJP leaders refrained from making strong statements. “We are a party of grassroot workers. We appreciate their sentiments. The president has received inputs from state units. All important issues will be taken up at the appropriate level,” Madhav said."

In a speech displaying restraint — amid calls from within the party to avenge the death of 18 soldiers — Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a leaf out of his own book which he had first used in May 2014, before BJP won the Lok Sabha polls, when he had suggested that India and Pakistan fight against poverty and unemployment.
“I want to tell Pakistan that India is ready to fight you. If you have guts, come forward to fight against poverty. Let’s see who wins? Who is able to defeat poverty and illiteracy first, Pakistan or India,” Modi said in Kozhikode on Saturday.
Modi’s comments on poverty and unemployment had come in the first week of May, during the Lok Sabha poll campaign. It was reiterated in May this year, though the two countries were still locked in an adversarial position over the Pathankot attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“This is a mark of a mature leader…even in this hour of provocation, he has shown maturity. He understands the challenge and wants the energy and determination of the country to be redirected in a positive direction,” former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal told The Sunday Express.
In May this year, Modi said in an interview to The Wall Street Journal: “In my view, our ties can truly scale great heights once Pakistan removes the self-imposed obstacle of terrorism in the path of our relationship.” He said he has always maintained that instead of fighting with each other, India and Pakistan should together fight poverty.

The PM’s comments in May this year, on the second anniversary of his government—“Pakistan’s failure to take effective action in punishing the perpetrators of terror attacks limits the forward progress in our ties” — had come at a time when New Delhi and Islamabad had put the dialogue process on hold after the Pathankot attack.
British newspaper Telegraph reported in May 2014 that Modi had said, in an interview to an Indian news outlet, that “India and Pakistan can together write a new chapter in the development of South Asia if the two countries were to concentrate on fighting poverty and unemployment”.
A South Block source, who was among those who helped craft the PM’s speech Saturday, told The Sunday Express that Modi’s statements are aimed at not just domestic expectations but also at the international community — especially since External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj may be asked in New York about India’s response template in the wake of the Uri attacks. “However, he has also said that the lives of these soldiers will not go in vain,” the source said, about managing domestic expectations. He said that the PM had himself given this idea, before his advisers and speech-writers in a briefing in the last one week.

Sources said the PM’s speech was carefully thought-out, especially since there was “war-mongering” in the debates in the media and social media and that would have led the international community to lean on Delhi in the coming weeks — unless the PM spoke out in a calmer voice.
A diplomat, who was involved in the UPA government’s response in the wake of the Mumbai attacks, recalled that then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee used to regularly tell the media that “all options are open” or “all options are on the table”. This had spooked the international community in November-December 2008 and led to almost all major powers to make calls and visits to convey the message of restraint to Mukherjee and Manmohan Singh, he said.
“We want to avoid such a situation… even as we work on isolating Pakistan at the global level, and think through our response at other levels,” the diplomat said.
A western diplomat, who watched Modi’s speech on Saturday, said that while Modi’s comments would have a “soothing impact” on the voices advocating military response, they also perceived it as a “tactic to bide time” before the government decides to take any concrete action."

A top American thin-tank has said that it is for Pakistan to take steps, including arresting militants and shutting down training camps, to defuse tensions as India weighs options to respond to the Uri terrorist attack that killed 18 soldiers.
“The ball is in Pakistan’s court to immediately defuse tensions. Only concrete steps, like arresting militant leaders and shutting down training camps, will convince India (and the world) that Islamabad is serious about preventing its territory from being used for terror attacks against its neighbors,” Lisa Curtis of The Heritage Foundation said yesterday.
Curtis warned that a military response by India could include targeted strikes on terrorist training camps inside Pakistani territory, but such strikes would almost certainly lead to military escalation and potential all-out war.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“India would have to weigh the consequences of allowing the region to devolve into India-Pakistani conflict for India’s quest to be viewed as a rising and responsible global power,” she said.
Curtis said the US had forcefully condemned the attack but should go a step further to defuse tensions by calling on Pakistan to rein in terrorist groups operating freely on its soil.

“The fact that Pakistan has failed eight years later to prosecute the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks belies its claims of not supporting cross-border terrorism,” she said.

A Kashmiri student was on Monday expelled from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) for posting “objectionable” comments on Facebook over the terror attack on the army base in Uri.
AMU Vice Chancellor Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah took a “very serious view” of the issue and expelled the student, who was pursuing M.Sc in Organic Chemistry, after personally probing the matter, university spokesman Rahat Abrar said.
“Lt Gen Shah said that there is no scope whatsoever at AMU for tolerating any incident which smacks of anti-national sentiments,” the spokesman said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The student, Mudassar Yusuf from Srinagar, had offered his apologies to the Vice Chancellor on Sunday for posting the comments stating that he was “carried away by sentiments”, according to university sources.

However, the university authorities decided to go ahead with his expulsion keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter, the sources said.

(File)
The bidding for telecom spectrum this year was protected with enhanced, multi-layered security measures as the chances of a hacking attempt after the Uri attacks were deemed very high, according to a top official of the company mandated to conduct the auction.
Without naming Pakistan, Vinaya Varma, CEO of mjunction, said the “threat perception was high this year from the western front”.
He said as the auction was highly publicised, special care was taken to look at vulnerabilities. “The procedure was made extremely secured so that any attempt to hack would fail,” Varma told IANS in an interview over phone from Kolkata.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We had deployed various security procedures such as secure login, digital signature certificate, fixed internet protocol address for bidders and other procedures to make bidding foolproof and transparent,” he said.
The company had also set up an infrastructure team to monitor any abnormal activity like intrusion or data filtering. The team ensured that all the links were working properly.
An e-marketplace, mjunction services limited, is a 50:50 venture promoted by SAIL and Tata Steel. It has won a three-year mandate from the government to conduct e-auction of spectrum. It conducted the first spectrum auction in 2015.
A total 2,354 MHz of spectrum was put on block for e-auctioning this year in seven bands — 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2,300 MHz and 2,500 MHz.
The bidding was also made secure from snooping. The platform was designed to ensure that while auction was in progress, the identity details of bidders were hidden through database-level encryption. Neither the auction administrator nor the seller (Department of Telecommunications, DoT) had any access to bidders’ bid details.
“The system allows access only to summary-level information of all bids made. Each bidder has access only to his own bidding history and also to summary-level information of all bids made. The platform provided separate dashboards for bidders and for DoT,” he said.
The platform for bidding was the same as last year but the offerings this time were higher.
This year there were 126 offerings (seven bands multiplied by service areas) compared to 69 last year when the auction took in only four bands. The offerings started at the same time, ran and closed simultaneously. Before 2015, auctions were done in a sequential manner.
“Auctioning was done through Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA), which is an internationally-recognised methodology for e-auctioning of spectrum. It is the most sophisticated methodology but also the most complicated. There are various permutations and combinations in spectrum allocation, which are in play in live bidding,” Varma said.
Asked how difficult or smooth the process was, Varma said: “The tender document preparation, system design, the programming and the actual execution of the auction were all very complex activities.”
Saying that mjunction works in close coordination with the government, Varma added that the Department of Electronics and Information Technology had spent weeks testing the auctioning platform before giving them the green light.
In 2015, when mjunction got the mandate, it took the company five months to design the platform. Because of the higher offerings this year, three more months were needed to customise it.
“We had set up a help desk with nine highly-trained people whom operators could call up for clarifications. We had also placed a domain expert in DoT.”
He said this time the spectrum offered was in contiguous range. Also, the frequency assignment was done in such a way that the operator got contiguous bands.
“The algorithm was designed by mjunction. The DoT just had to press a button to allocate contiguous bands. Manually it would have been very difficult,” Varma added."

(PTI Photo)
There were moments back there on Sunday and Monday when you seriously considered digging a bomb shelter. “Now enough” said, Sudarshan News, “Abki baar, seema paar” proclaimed ETV. In TV news studios, retired senior army officers had declared war: “The LoC is over. Indian troops can go across” (R.S. Singh, CNBC Awaaz), time for “Indian troops on Pakistan soil” (Gaurav Arya, India Today), “hit back” (R.K. Singh, all channels), “Give a military response, time to call their (nuclear threat) bluff”, (G.D. Bakshi, News X), “We should form our own fidayeen (Shankar Roy Choudhary, NDTV 24×7), “become like Israel” (Sahgal, News 24).
“Kya full-fledged war ho sakta hai?” asked the Zee News anchor. It was just past 3 pm on Sunday afternoon, less than 12 hours since a terrorist attack had killed 17 Indian soldiers in Uri and we were already on the brink of war. Bas, “dil hone chhahiye”, said Brig A. Kapoor (News World India). On and on it went without surcease: India needs to take overt, covert action, use drones, mount surgical strikes, declare war, nuclear war (Sushant Sareen) — these and other violent suggestions were tossed into TV news debates as casually as a peanut into the mouth.
Understandably, everyone was deeply upset by the Uri attack and enraged by Pakistan’s overt or covert involvement. What better place to vent your feelings than the TV studio — or social media — where the first casualty is restraint?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Other than breaking news on high-level government meetings and spot reports from Uri on Sunday, TV news latched onto every former military man it could find and they were raring to have a go at the enemy. It was as if they had climbed back into their army uniforms — Lt. General Jaswal appeared in his dashing army headgear — and were headed straight across the LoC. “The time for talk was over,” said Major General A. Karim (Zee News).
But war, it seemed, had been declared not only across the border. News X had identified the enemy within. On Sunday afternoon, it went after the Left — for advocating talks in Kashmir with all stakeholders — Left liberals and the Congress. Anchor Rahul Shivshankar cornered Congressman C. R. Kesavan on AFSPA. Now, where was this coming from and where was it going?
On Monday, Shankar went after the “doves”, people like Kavita Krishnan who had not, he claimed, publicly spoken on the Uri attack. Very odd of him, but all of a piece with the one voice, one nation narrative that seems to be overtaking television, barring a few sane voices such as Ravish Kumar, NDTV India.
By Monday, war had been declared on Pakistan especially on Times Now, News X, India Today and CNN News’s “India’s #AsalUttarUri”. These channels gave the impression that they knew everything the government was thinking and planning to do. Thus, Monday afternoon, Times Now, India Today and CNN News gave us “exclusive” details of the government’s “thought process” (Times Now) on its post-Uri strategy, no matter they differed, significantly, with each other’s versions. By Tuesday, they declared that 10 terrorist “infiltrators” had been killed by India although there was no government confirmation of this number. Do they know something — or more — than the authorities do?
On Tuesday evening, some balance was restored. The Buck Stops Here (NDTV 24×7) looked at how Pakistan sought to internationalise the Kashmir issue, To The Point (India Today) considered the security lapses that may have led to the tragic attack at Uri. The war cries were subdued, if only momentarily.
Two other stories diverted the TV wars from the LoC: The video of a young girl being stabbed mercilessly — shown far too often on Tuesday — and the end of romance with Brangelina.
Sometimes, nothing makes sense any more."

Remember the constable Manoj Kumar’s patriotic poem, “Kashmir to hoga, Pakistan nahi hoga (Kashmir would remain, Pakistan would not)” that went viral after Uri attacks in which 18 Indian soldiers were killed. Kumar, posted on Facebook that he has received a death threat from the ‘enemy’ but he doesn’t fear and will continue to fight in the same spirit. He also shared screenshots of the messages he recieved.
According to the screenshots, he received the threats from a Facebook user called Farman Khan who said that if given an opportunity, the man would kill Kumar with his own hands. In another message, a man named Bilal Ahmad abused Kumar while criticising him for his poem.
The officer’s poem had won the Internet when he sang, ‘Siyar bhediye se dar sakti singhon ki aulad nahi, bharat vansh k is paani ki hai tumko pehchan nahi‘, which literally translates to ‘the children of lions will not be afraid of the wolves, you do not know the waters that flow through our country.’https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
And well, his response to the threats was similar. “Friends, I have been receiving threats from the enemy. I am glad they’re shaken. Someone even wants to kill me. But I swear on my land, martyrs, that I will face them head on if ever I come face to face with them,” he wrote in Hindi.
His post has gone viral on social media and people across the country are puring support with ‘we are with you’ messages on his Timeline.

Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan has crooned a track for Raveena Tandon starrer Maatr-The Mother. Its producer says the song was recorded before bilateral tensions between India and Pakistan surfaced last year. “Rahat Fateh Ali Khan had recorded the song ‘Zindagi ae zindagi’. It’s an emotional track mapping Raveena’s journey as a mother for the film. We have decided to retain the song as it was recorded before the India, Pakistan tension began,” producer Anjum Rizvi said in a statement.
After the September 2016 Uri attack, there has been tension between both countries. A few Indian outfits even imposed a ban on Pakistani artistes working in this country. Just last week, there was also news that filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt had approached Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali to sing for his upcoming play “Milne Do”, which will be staged in Delhi in June. And now the update on Rahat’s song in an Indian film could give relief to those who believe art and culture should be kept out of politics.

Maatr – The Mother director Ashtar Sayed, who finds Rahat’s voice mesmerising, said: “The film originally didn’t have any music, but when we started editing the movie, we felt the need for it. So we got some beautiful songs and lyrics for our film. “The music has been given by a Pakistani Sufi rock band Fuzön.

(AP Photo)
“Mera yaar, dildaar Imran Khan jiwe (my dear friend Imran Khan, may you live long),” thundered Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday, drawing massive applause at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor. Khan, with fingers on his chin, smiled as the crowd roared.
Three months ago, cricketer-turned-politician Sidhu had got into trouble after he hugged Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa during Khan’s swearing-in ceremony. That hug set the ball rolling for the Kartarpur corridor, which was promised by Bajwa.
“I live in a space where the mind is without fear and the head is held high,” Sidhu said, quoting Rabindranath Tagore’s poem and taking a dig at his political rivals, Union ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Hardeep Singh Puri, who were present at the event across the border.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png




	Read: Imran Khan: Army, parties and I on same page when it comes to better India ties



Kaur had lashed out at Sidhu then for hugging Bajwa; External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had reprimanded him for the act.
Khan, who spoke about Sidhu facing criticism after his last trip, said, “If there were more such hugs, many such problems could have been solved.”
On Wednesday, standing tall amid a crowd which cheered at his expressions, and with his political rival Harsimrat of the Shiromani Akali Dal sitting quietly in the front row, Sidhu stole the show. He was seated closer to Khan, and next to Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.
Harsimrat , who turned emotional while speaking, said the gurdwara at Kartarpur was a case of “so near and yet so far”. Not mentioning contentious issues such as terrorism, she said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a step, Khan took two steps.
She also spoke about collapse of the Berlin Wall, and how history can be made. She recalled Guru Nanak’s philosophy that there is no Hindu or Muslim, but only human beings.
She suggested that stamps and coins be issued by the Pakistan government, as well as trains to connect Sikh pilgrimage sites on Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary, as the Modi government has decided in India.

Chants of Jo bole so Nihal, Sat Sri Akal from the crowd punctuated their speeches.
Khan, who spoke fondly of his former cricketer-friend’s popularity, joked that Sidhu will win elections in Pakistan’s Punjab if he contests. He added, “We hope we don’t have to wait till Sidhu becomes PM, before peace talks happen.”
Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Puri did not speak at the event. Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi said Imran Khan has accomplished what could not be done in 71 years. This was the first time Modi government ministers travelled to Pakistan since the Uri attacks.
The Offering
Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal brought some soil and holy water from Punjab side, and offered it at the Gurdwara. As a Union government representative — although outshined by political rival Navjot Singh Sidhu — she was the only one to speak. Her colleague, Hardeep Puri, did not speak at the event.
In The Audience
One of the controversial figures who blocked entry of Indian diplomats inside Gurdwara Nankana Sahib last week, Gopal Singh Chawla, was also seen in the audience at the ground-breaking ceremony. Chawla, who is secretary general of Pakistan Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, had been instrumental in putting up pro-Khalistan posters at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib.
The Arrangements
Although the groundbreaking ceremony was in the afternoon, the Pakistan government made arrangements for the dignitaries as well as others who attended the event.

In a world where “war on terror” is the overarching framework, the India-Pakistan conflict has entered a dangerous game of one-upmanship through popular media, where news outlets, cinema and the movement of artists are viewed as instruments of conflict. This makes the pursuit of normalisation, or even the resolution of long-standing disputes, difficult, if not impossible.
Some years ago, I began hearing the term “non-kinetic” in the context of warfare being waged against Pakistan by its adversaries. I found it refers to the use of informational, psychological and technological means to undermine “national will of the adversary”. The security jargon keeps creating new ways to keep the war business going — a main lever of security states is the media.
Islamabad and New Delhi have discovered a new source of national prowess — the howling television anchor, along with the toxic analyst who simulates multiple defeats of the “enemy” within seconds. Information warfare is not new. The best example is perhaps the United States where popular media is an instrument of war propaganda. The classic case is the way The New York Times supported the invasion of Iraq and built public support, citing inside sources. Thirteen years later, there is consensus that it was a colossal mistake — even politicians like Donald Trump are eager to distance themselves from that misadventure.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Reporting on national security issues in both India and Pakistan largely propagates state narratives. The role of media has been critical to the trajectory of bilateral relations but the emergence of media as a party, or worse, an abettor of conflict, is worrying. By its very definition, journalism serves public interest, but in our case, it has turned into a vehicle of articulating “national interest” as defined by the state. Questioning the state is misrepresented as attacking “vital national interests” in both countries. Even mildly critical journalists are immediately termed “anti-national” and advised to move to the “enemy” territory.
Powerful corporate interests drive this show. In Pakistan, the military is hegemonic. In India, corporate power is aligned with political elites. In this process, truth is secondary. Both on the Uri attacks and the subsequent “surgical strikes” (which Pakistan vehemently denies ever took place), the publics in both nations believe what their governments tell them. On social media, Pakistanis have been lampooning the trumpeted strikes, while Indians have been celebrating a victory reminiscent of India’s role in breaking up Pakistan. Pakistani media says the country is not isolated as China, Russia and the US are still allies. Indian pundits cite the cancellation of the SAARC summit as a sign of successfully isolating Pakistan.
The war theatre has shifted to media where battles are lost and fought on a daily basis.
Recently, Pakistan’s leading newspaper Dawn published a report recounting how, in a high-level security meeting, the civilian government officials reportedly warned the military leadership of the growing international isolation of Pakistan and sought consensus on fighting non-state actors. After two denials, the chiefs of army and the ISI met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif where the Dawn story was discussed. The prime minister’s office issued another denial, lectured the media on principles of reporting “national security issues” and called for “stern action” against those violating these principles in this case. The journalist who wrote that report was placed on the Exit Control List for a few days. After national and international pressure, the ban on his travel was lifted.
Dawn has come under the dark cloud of state oversight because it sought to expose that the national security doctrine is contested and not uniformly viewed by civil and military actors. Perhaps what alarmed the security establishment is that the report became major headlines in Indian (and global) media. Hyper-nationalists saw it as information warfare from within, as it benefits the “enemy”.
Indian journalists have also spoken out over the recent India-Pakistan crisis. A number of Indian liberal journalists criticise the warmongering model where studios are converted into “war rooms” for commercially driven ratings. Some have questioned state narratives, especially on the “surgical strikes”. But in the echo chamber of propagated “party lines”, these voices have been drowned by the mainstream. Punishing and bombing Pakistan — forgetting there are 200 million people living in that country — has been the loudest of “solutions”.
In such an environment, media persons are left with few choices: To conform or be ready to pay the price for independent reporting. Both in India and Pakistan, those questioning the dominant discourse are “enemy agents”. Self-censorship in the name of security is hence another practice by media outlets, with smug declarations of adhering to “national interest”. An Indian television channel decided to censor an interview with P. Chidambaram, India’s former home minister, on the “surgical strikes” inside Pakistan-administered Kashmir. National security trumped domestic politics, was the line taken by the channel.
If the task of journalists is to inform, educate and question, then this line is untenable. How can a politician’s questioning — especially someone who’s been at the helm of power — risk national security? Whether there was covert governmental intervention or not, it is baffling as to how a supposedly independent media house assumed itself to be an arm of the security architecture of the country.
In recent months, the loss of hundreds of lives of Kashmiris received far less media condemnation as opposed to those of soldiers. The binary of a “martial” Pakistan versus a “democratic” India dissipates into thin air when a country’s media wants to launch a war for the loss of soldiers, but doesn’t urge the government to soothe the troubled soul of Jammu and Kashmir. The reduction of the Kashmir issue to that of Pakistan’s intervention is a mirror image of what the Pakistani public has been fed with — that terrorism, the Baloch insurgency and natural disasters are all due to India.
The net result is, spaces for accurate, verified information, constructive opinion-making and reasoned dialogue are eroding. The public in India and Pakistan, fed on statist narratives, view the “other” as singularly responsible for acrimony, terror and domestic turbulence. This line is convenient as it denudes the scope for governmental accountability. Hatred and aggrandisement have grown. History tells us such passions are lethal — let alone capable of providing a solution."

BJP CHIEF Amit Shah on Tuesday said the party winning recent bypolls in Assam and Madhya Pradesh and civic polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat showed people’s support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move and claimed some Opposition leaders were upset as their money, “looted” in scams, has turned into trash.
“While the Opposition is organising Bharat bandh and Akrosh Diwas… everywhere BJP has posted unprecedented victory… People across the nation is supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his decision of demonetisation… You all tell me… are you with demonetisation or with bua-bhatija,” Shah asked the gathering at party’s parivartan rally in Maharajganj on the Indo-Nepal border. He was referring to BSP chief Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

“Rahul baba, Akhilesh babu, behan Mayawati… gareeb ke paas kala dhan nahi hai… aapke paas jo pada tha who sara ka saara doob gaya (Poor do not have black money… the black money you had has gone waste),” said the BJP president.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Stepping up attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said: “SP, BSP, Congress, Mamata (Banerjee), (Arvind) Kejriwal are all angry with Narendra Modi today. Do you know why… what was amassed through loot has been turned into raddi (trash) by Modiji on November 8… Modiji has announced that those depositing large amounts in their accounts like Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore… the looted money will be used for welfare of the poor.”
Taking on Akhilesh, he said, “If farmers in UP are not getting benefit of schemes, the Akhilesh government is responsible… The PM has launched schemes for the welfare and empowerment of farmers. The ruling party of UP is full of land mafias and the government cannot work for the development of the state.”
Taking a dig at the previous UPA regime, Shah said: “For 10 years, those amassing trillions of rupees in their homes through scams are today angry with Modi… Till the morning of November 8, they all used to ask Modiji, what have you done against black money and today they are asking why have you done this… The country is with Modiji… it is in favour of demonetisation.” He also alleged that fake notes had made their way into India during UPA rule.
Hitting out at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for his ‘khoon ki dalali’ remark on surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah said Modi government took action within 10 days of the Uri attack unlike the previous government. “But Congress shehzada (prince) says Modiji indulges in khoon ki dalali… Rahul baba, how will you know the value of Army jawans’ bravery… how will you know the value of their sacrifice… it is invaluable,” Shah said, claiming that no one can dare touch the boundaries of the country under the BJP government.
Speaking on triple talaq, Shah claimed that while SP, BSP and Congress are in support of the practice, the BJP-led Centre wants to restore rights of Muslim women.
“Shouldn’t Muslim women have rights? But SP, BSP and Congress believe that the country should follow triple talaq,” Shah claimed. He went on to appeal to the masses to make UP elections “a poll for women’s rights”, so that people cast their vote on this issue.
Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, in his address, said members of terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen had misused Nepal border to enter India between 2011 and 2014.
“They used to enter UP through Kathmandu. The government used to send them to Jammu-Kashmir like guests. But from the day Narendra Modi took oath as PM, such activities have stopped automatically at the border,” he added."

India’s efforts to get a BRICS credit rating agency set up on Sunday appeared to have hit a roadblock due to lack consensus after some members voiced “concerns” over the “credibility” and access to “dependable data” for the new entity to take on the Wall Street-based Big 3 run on commercial principles. “The leaders were mainly convinced but we couldn’t sign the agreement right now because there is a sense that experts need to look at it more closely,” Economic Relations Secretary Amar Sinha told reporters after the Eighth BRICS Summit.

He said because of the lack of consensus, the item has been included under the “action plan” and not in the Goa Declaration. Elaborating on the concerns, he said, “Every credit rating agency has to have credibility and access to absolutely dependable data. These two things the experts have to look at now.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sinha, however, said this is not a setback, pointing out to the other items on the economic cooperation front like agri research and customs cooperation saw consensus.
The proposed credit rating agency also found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s closing remarks. “To further bridge the gap in the global financial architecture, we agreed to fast track the setting up of a BRICS Rating Agency,” he said in the joint declaration.
India had first mooted the idea of having such an agency for the BRICS grouping which can solve impediments for the emerging market economies posed by the present CRA market, which is dominated by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, all based in Wall Street and being run with pure commercial considerations.

These three hold over 90 per cent of the sovereign ratings market now. Indian officials were at the forefront of pointing out to the shortcomings and the need to have an alternative CRA in the days leading to the Goa summit and during deliberations at the conclave here over the weekend.
According to media reports over the weekend, China had raised certain concerns about the proposal and was not in favour of setting up one now.
One of the prime reservations stemmed from the current approach of making the issuer paying for the rating and the strong desire of shifting it to an investor-pays approach to make it more credible.
Other factors which have been flagged included the weighting accorded to a particular country’s sovereign rating while assigning the sovereign rating, without considering an issuer’s capital position.
The Exim Bank of India had presented a concept paper on the need to have such a body and its chairman Yaduvendra Mathur had flagged key issues surrounding conflicts of interest and also higher cost of operating under the present framework on the eve of the summit.
In an interview to PTI in the run-up to the government level summit, Mathur had also said there was an urgent need to have a professional credit rating agency (CRA) which could operate with full integrity.
Citing the case of his own organisation, he said Exim Bank is rated AAA domestically but goes down at par with India’s sovereign rating internationally, leading to higher cost of borrowings.
It can be noted that the BRICS grouping has been successful in creating a development bank to help overcome the infrastructure funding challenges that they are facing.
When asked about how an agency promoted by member-countries can get the desired level of credibility, Mathur had said a technical working group is looking into the issue and will come up with solutions.
Veteran banker and president of the BRICS-promoted New Development Bank, K V Kamath, had also yesterday backed the setting up of such an agency, alleging growth is constrained in the present set up.
“We need not constrain ourselves from our ability to do business…if this is the norm, I fear growth in the developing world will also be impacted,” he told media in an interaction."

Filmmaker Shyam Benegal is saddened to see that director Karan Johar is being unnecessarily harassed for casting Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (ADHM). Benegal wants the government to step in to protect the film industry which is particularly vulnerable. “I am very saddened by what he had to say because the poor chap (Karan) is being unnecessarily harassed in a way because after all, over Rs.50 crore is at stake. What do you expect him to say?,” Benegal said.

“Film industry is particularly vulnerable. They (film fraternity) need to be protected from people who will threaten them or attack them. We cannot avoid these things. Government has to protect us against these kind of attacks,” added Benegal referring to several political outfits’ threats to multiplexes who will screen ADHM soon. The filmmaker, who heads the government-appointed revamp panel of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), expressed after the latest turn of events when Karan broke his silence about the forthcoming film, which will release on October 28, two days before Diwali.

In a two-minute long video, Karan said that he is hurt on being labelled “anti-national” ahead of the release of his directorial and production venture ADHM, and said he would not engage with talent from Pakistan “in the circumstance”. Benegal feels the “government should protect people like that. It is the duty of the government to protect people against the kind of threats that he (Karan) probably has received or is likely to receive”.

Karan’s film became the first target of those who are against inclusion of Pakistani artistes in Indian films after the September 18 Uri attack that killed 19 Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack was followed by surgical strikes that India conducted on terror camps across the LoC. While the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to quit India, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution asking producers to avoid working with talent from Pakistan.

Benegal asserts that no one is being unpatriotic, “Nobody has done anything unpatriotic. If you are born here, got education here, are working here, making your livelihood here and are voting every election, then why should you be constantly told to prove your credentials. What more credentials do you want? If you are an Indian then you are an Indian and are proud to be an Indian. I don’t have to say that every day and every morning from my terrace that ‘I am an Indian, and I am proud Indian’,” he said.

What does he think about various groups demanding a ban on Pakistani talent working in India? The 81-year-old said: “The fact is when the relationship between the neighbours was happy and okay, we were taking people from Pakistan. In fact, our actors and directors were also going to the other side. It was stopped because of the skirmishes on the border. This is a temporary thing.”"

It’s no secret that Virender Sehwag is hands down the most witty personality on Indian Twitter. His humour is unmatched and his one-liners are possibly one of the best one can find on the Internet; ‘memeworthy’ as they call it. And believe it or not, his birthday wishes are epic. People who know Sehwag personally must wait for his brilliant tweets on their birthdays.
Exhibiting his skills, he wished fellow cricketer Mohammad Kaif on his birthday on December 1 with lyrics of Sunny Deol’s song and asked him if he was a man or kite! You can expect that from Sehwag. “Udja Kale Kawan Tere Moowich Khandpaanwa”, @MohammadKaif tuk dis song seriously&kept flying kahin bhi. #HappyBirthdayKaif ,R u Man or Kite?” he wrote.

But unlike the usual ‘Thank you, Viru paaji’ that most replies read, Kaif responded in Sehwag’s language and conveyed his gratitude in the most hilarious way possible. “Hahaha, thanks Viru ! And you took the movie “De Dana Dan”title seriously ,even before it released. Keep entertaining like always !” he wrote
It’s not the first Kaif is winning hearts on social media. Remember his message to people for all the soldiers right after the Uri attacks in September. He tweeted a heartwarming message for our jawans which touched a chord with many. “Leave of all Jawans have been cancelled. If in train or bus, you see a Jawan without a seat, do offer them a seat,” he wrote.

For Aditya Dhar, 2019 was a path-breaking year. While his debut directorial Uri: The Surgical Strike became the first blockbuster of 2019, it also went on to win several National Film Awards including Best Direction, Best Actor, Best Sound Design and Best Background Score.
Summarising the year, Dhar exclusively told indianexpress.com, “2019 has been my most rewarding year till date. After years of struggling through many projects that got shelved for some reason, the wait turned out to be worthwhile and gratifying. Uri not only found its way into the hearts of millions across the country but also evoked a sense of patriotism in people across generations. That was the proudest moment for me.”
Uri: The Surgical Strike, starring Vicky Kaushal, Mohit Raina, Yami Gautam and others, is based on the 2016 Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan as a retaliation for the Uri attack. It is also one of the highest-grossing films of 2019.
Sharing how the year impacted him as a filmmaker and a person, Aditya Dhar added, “After receiving so much love from the audience, 2019 has been nothing but a boost of encouragement for me both as a filmmaker and as a human being. While it has raised the bar high for me as a filmmaker, it has only made me more grounded as a person. I realise how important it is to understand the responsibility of retelling the story of people, for the people.”

Dhar is set to reunite with Vicky Kaushal in his next directorial based on Ashwatthama, the mythological character from Mahabharata. The director, who is looking forward to 2020, said, “2020 is going to be a year of hard work to raise the bar higher with my next film, The Immortal Ashwatthama. My goal is to create an environment where we can match the standards of top film industries from around the world. The aim is to collaborate with them and tell stories that appeal to a global audience. With Ashwatthama, the idea is to invite the younger generation into the fascinating world of Indian mythology, while also introducing it on the global front.”

Accusing Pakistan of using terrorism as a state policy against India, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said the Modi government would like to assure the people of the country that in the battle of peace versus terrorism “terror and its masters” will be destroyed. While paying tributes to the brave soldiers who lost their lives in Sunday’s Uri terror attack, Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) Naqvi said that the Army is capable to defeat any conspiracy against our nation.
He said that India wants “good relations” with all its neighbors but if Pakistan doesn’t stop using its soil for anti-India activities, it will have to pay a “heavy price” for conspiracy against India.
“Pakistan has been using terrorism as a state policy against India. But the Modi Government assures the people of the country that in the battle of peace versus terrorism, terror and its masters will be destroyed,” a statement quoted the Minister as saying during a book release in New Delhi. Naqvi said that Pakistan has been “exposed” before the entire world “only because of “zero tolerance” policy adopted by the NDA Government against terrorism.
Pakistan has been isolated in the entire world and its image has become of a “terrorist nation”, he added."

References to Kashmir and tensions arising out of Uri terror attack were conspicuously absent in Chinese official media coverage of the meeting between China Premier Li Keqiang and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif here.
As all-weather strategic partners of cooperation, China and Pakistan have always firmly supported each other and their friendship is unbreakable, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Li as saying while meeting Sharif on the sidelines of UN General Assembly session. China stands ready to deepen all-round practical cooperation with Pakistan and is willing to make joint efforts with Islamabad in injecting new impetus into the development of bilateral relations, Li said.
While noting that practical cooperation focusing on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has made positive progress, Li urged the two sides to carry out the planned construction of the corridor, accelerate the building of the Gwadar Port as well as its supporting facility, and bring more companies into industrial parks, the report said.

China is willing to maintain close high-level contacts and continue to strengthen coordination with Pakistan on global and regional affairs, Li said. However, contrary to reports in Pakistan media, there were no references to Kashmir situation or Uri attack in Xinhua’s story on Li-Sharif meeting. A report in Pakistani daily Dawn had said “Li had assured that China would continue to support Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir”.
The Dawn report quoted Li as telling Sharif that: “We support Pakistan and we will speak for Pakistan at every forum.” China attached great importance to Pakistan’s position on Kashmir and said “Pakistan itself was a victim of terrorism”, it said.
The Chinese premier hoped that there would be better understanding of Pakistani position on Kashmir by the international community, the report had quoted Li as saying. Sharif showed his satisfaction on the state of Pak-China relations and welcomed the statement of China on the ‘atrocities’ being committed in Kashmir, the report had said. Li expressed the hope that situation between India and Pakistan would not escalate.
He said China was ready to play constructive role in improvement of relations between Pakistan and India. Xinhua quoted Sharif as telling Li that Pakistan and China are time-tested friends and partners who have firmly supported each other. As their relations develop very smoothly, bilateral cooperation in a variety of fields has also entered a new phase. The Pakistani side cherishes friendship with China, and is committed to promoting bilateral cooperation, Sharif was quoted as saying."

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday dubbed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Lucknow to attend the Dussehra celebrations as politically motivated with an eye on the upcoming state assembly polls.
“What can I say about anyone going anywhere? We have to follow a protocol we will do it. I guess if elections were happening in Bihar then the Ravana would have been burnt there,” Akhilesh told a press conference.
Echoing similar sentiments, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati yesterday dubbed Prime Minister’s Modi’s visit to Lucknow a political stunt and said that the event should have been toned down taking into account the loss suffered by the families of soldiers killed in the Uri terror attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The pyre of jawans who lost their lives in the Uri attack has not yet died down, but the Prime Minister is coming to Lucknow to celebrate Dussehra for his political motives,” she said.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit Lucknow and attend Dussehra festivities at the historic Aishbagh Ramlila ground on October 11."

(Source Reuters)
In what is being read as the first signal from Islamabad after ties with New Delhi hit rock bottom, the Pakistan government has decided to send Sartaj Aziz, foreign affairs advisor to its Prime Minister, for the Heart of Asia conference in Amritsar on December 3-4.
This will be the first ministerial-level visit — Aziz is the de facto Minister for Foreign Affairs — from Pakistan after the Pathankot attack in January derailed the proposed bilateral dialogue process between the two countries. Relations plummeted sharply in the wake of the Uri attack, India’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control and the daily exchange of fire by troops on either side.
Although Pakistan had confirmed earlier that it would attend the Amritsar conference, the decision to send Aziz is considered significant.
Watch What Else Is making Newshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The conference on Afghanistan’s future will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani.
Pakistan public broadcaster PTV quoted Aziz saying, “Unlike India, that had sabotaged the SAARC summit in Pakistan by pulling out, Pakistan will respond by participating in the Heart of Asia being held in India. It’s a good opportunity to defuse tension.”
Aziz said he himself will participate in the conference and will not repeat India’s “blunder” of boycotting the SAARC summit which was to be held in Islamabad this month.
Officials in Islamabad see this as an opportunity to try and “normalise” relations. “We are constructive about the relationship… would like to see some progress… but is New Delhi ready?” a Pakistani official told The Indian Express.
While there was no official word from New Delhi on Pakistan’s decision to send Aziz, Indian officials said he was welcome to attend the Heart of Asia conference. “It is a multilateral event… and every participant’s presence will be treated as such. No bilateral importance should be attached to it,” South Block sources said.
Pakistan, sources said, cannot afford to stay away from a conference where the future of Afghanistan is being discussed. “It is important for them to stay in the room,” sources said.
Last December, when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad for the last Heart of Asia ministerial meeting, she held a bilateral meeting with Aziz. She also met Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family members.
The meetings led to the resumption of the comprehensive bilateral dialogue process, but that stalled after the terror attack on the Pathankot airbase. Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry had visited New Delhi in April for a meeting of the Heart of Asia officials."

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray today congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army across LoC and expressed hope that “it is only a beginning”.
“What our brave soldiers did has brought immense pride to the nation. I wish to congratulate them on their feat. I even called up PM Modi, congratulated him and expressed hope that this only a beginning,” Thackeray told reporters here.

India carried out ‘surgical strikes’ on terror launch pads across LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Army action came days after the terror strike by Pakistan-based JeM on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Kashmir which left 19 Indian soldiers dead.
Refusing to comment further on the Army operation, Thackeray said he would put forth views in detail while speaking at the Sena’s annual Dussehra rally.
Earlier, the Sena in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, had taken veiled digs at Modi over India’s moves against Pakistan after the Uri attack and had said the neighbouring country’s PM, Nawaz Sharif, was showing off his “56-inch chest”.
The Sena had said that it feared that India had actually been isolated in the world with its efforts yielding little result other than mere “lip service” by global leaders.
In another editorial, the party had criticised Modi for launching a diplomatic attack on Pakistan after terrorists killed Indian Army jawans in Uri, saying the Centre must take action instead of indulging in a war of words with Pakistan."

The entire Opposition including the Congress, the Left, AAP and the JD(U) condemned the terror attack in Uri that killed 17 soldiers Sunday and demanded that the perpetrators be severely dealt with. “Congress president Sonia Gandhi has expressed shock and deep distress over the martyrdom of Indian soldiers in the dastardly terrorist attack in Uri,” a party statement said. Describing the “cowardly” attack as a “deplorable affront on our national conscience”, Sonia expressed hope that “the perpetrators of this dastardly attack as also the forces behind them will be severely dealt with and brought to book”.

“Our soldiers are being killed because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s negligence.

How can there be such an attack on our jawans despite intelligence alerts?”

Former defence minister A K Antony too hit out at the government: “It is a serious security lapse. The central government has not learnt any lesson from the Pathankot attack.”
Former home minister P Chidambaram said the government must mobilise resources to strengthen border defence. “Shocked and distressed by the terror attack in Uri. Salute the jawans. Government must mobilise all resources, manpower and material, to strengthen border defence to prevent infiltration of terrorists,” he tweeted. Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari called for a robust response from the PM.

The CPM, while condemning the attack, asked the government to initiate a political dialogue with all stakeholders to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue. “Terrorism is not the solution to the Kashmir issue. Such acts only compound the situation further. Pakistan must stop aiding and abetting the extremist forces. Such activities are a big impediment to the peace process in region,” the CPM said. “For a longstanding solution of the Kashmir problem, the political dialogue with all stakeholders as advocated by the all-party delegation should be initiated without any further delay,” it added.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “India cannot be cowed down by such attacks. I strongly condemn the cowardly attack at Uri in which 17 soldiers lost lives. My heartfelt condolences to the families of those martyred in Uri.”
Meanwhile, BJP ally Shiv Sena warned the government that it would have to face the anger of the people if it did not take urgent steps against Pakistan. “There is no need to talk now.

Earlier, the cinema owners said that their businesses dipped by 70 percent since the screening of Indian films were suspended in the wake of tension due to Uri attacks and ‘surgical strikes’ episode last year.
Check Rakesh Roshan’s tweet on Kaabil’s Pakistan release:

The decision to allow import of Indian films was taken after a government committee held consultations with various stakeholders and recommended Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif allow screening of Bollywood movies.
After approval by Sharif, the information ministry issued a letter late yesterday that the government is “pleased to continue the existing open policy to display all international movies (including Indian films) in Pakistani cinemas”.

In one of the worst terror attacks on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir, 17 Army personnel were killed and 20 left injured early Sunday by four heavily armed terrorists who sneaked into the administrative buildings and store complex of an infantry battalion in Uri, home of the 12 Infantry Brigade, near the Line of Control (LoC).
Seven of the 20 injured soldiers, 18 of whom were evacuated in helicopters to the 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar, are said to be in critical condition.
The four terrorists were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle, and a combing operation was underway. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Among the dead, 15 soldiers were from the Bihar regiment while two were from the Dogra regiment. The Army said 13-14 casualties had been due to the tents and temporary shelters catching fire. It has not officially put out the list of the dead since some of the bodies are yet to be identified.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised that the attack will not go unpunished, Army chief General Dalbir Singh flew to Srinagar and then to Uri to take stock.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar too reached Srinagar where he was briefed by the Army chief. A red alert has been sounded across Kashmir and security measures at all Army installations have been stepped up.

Army sources in J&K said, as per their assessment, the terrorists probably infiltrated in the last two days and familiarised themselves with the area through discreet reconnaissance. It is suspected that some kind of local intelligence was made available, guiding the terrorists to strike where they did at a particular time and place.
The attack site is barely a kilometre away from Uri town. On the other side of the camp is Jabla village, 1.5 km away. Villagers have to pass through highly fortified camps and have to show special border passes to enter the brigade headquarters and its adjacent camps. The encounter spot is barely 2.5 km from the LoC Trade Facilitation Centre at Salamabad.

In New Delhi, Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations, said: “Initial reports indicate that the slain terrorists belong to Jaish-e-Muhammad tanzeem. Four AK-47 rifles and four under barrel grenade launchers, along with a large number of war-like stores, were recovered from them.”
Since the terrorists had some items with Pakistani markings, the DGMO spoke to his Pakistan Army counterpart and conveyed “our serious concerns on the same”.
A PTI report from Islamabad quoted Pakistan Army spokesman Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa as saying that the DGMOs discussed the situation along the LoC over hotline. “Refuting the unfounded and premature Indian allegation, Pakistan DGMO asked his counterpart to share any actionable intelligence,” Radio Pakistan reported citing an ISPR release.

The terrorists opened fire at the Uri administrative base of 10 Dogra — the infantry battalion is being replaced on the LoC by 6 Bihar as part of the 12 Infantry Brigade — around 5.30 am. Army sources in J&K said the terrorists sneaked into the camp via nallahs at the periphery of the camp. Along with AK-47, the terrorists also used incendiary ammunition which led to some of the tents and temporary accommodation catching fire.
These temporary accommodation had been erected for the incoming 6 Bihar battalion which had moved to Uri last week after completing a three-week pre-induction training at Corps Battle School, Khrew. The battalion had been addressed by the Brigade commander at a Sainik Sammelan Saturday. It was supposed to move for ‘on the job’ training with 10 Dogra, before fully replacing them on the LoC by October.

“The turn-over of units is the most vulnerable time, and all units are advised to be extra careful during this period. It is definitely a lapse but the terrorists also got lucky. There is huge concern at the highest levels that we couldn’t prevent this attack,” a senior Army officer said.
Army sources in J&K said the administrative base of the battalion also had rations and stores for Advanced Winter Stocking (AWS) of its posts at the LoC. These items, which are ferried to the posts before snowfall, are used by soldiers on the far-flung posts to sustain themselves during winter when they are cut-off. Kerosene oil is a major item in AWS and could have aggravated the fire, sources said.

On reports that specific intelligence inputs were available about Sunday’s terror attack, sources in the Udhampur-based Northern Command told The Indian Express: “Broad intelligence inputs were available for various locations in all sectors, including Uri and Mendhar. If you see around the same time last year, these same inputs in similar language were given. It is not correct to suggest that these intelligence inputs were ignored.”

This was the third attack on the Army in north Kashmir in the past one month. Earlier, terrorists had attacked an Army convoy in Baramulla town, killing two soldiers. In another attack at Kralgund, three soldiers were injured.
A senior Army officer posted in the area said the reason for the high casualties was the large number of soldiers present due to the turn-over of battalions and the tents catching fire, as the terrorists fired indiscriminately. “As the troops were all over the camp, the Army and its QRTs (quick reaction teams) moved cautiously to avoid further casualties,’’ he added.
The camp had a designated QRT which reacted swiftly but maximum casualties were inflicted by the terrorists within the first few minutes of the attack. Soldiers within the camp and the QRTs cordoned off the area and engaged the terrorists who were heavily armed. Three terrorists were killed within 15 minutes of the start of firefight while the fourth terrorist was eliminated by 8.30 am.
The Army airlifted its injured to 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar. From morning until afternoon, Army helicopters conducted more than 20 sorties. Civil surgeons assisted the Army in carrying out surgeries at the Army hospital.
Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Uri town, said: “I woke up to a deafening sound around 5.30 am, followed by two more blasts and firing. I initially thought it was cross-border shelling. Half an hour later, when the firing continued, it was clear that it was an attack.’’
Another resident, Manzoor Ahmad Khawja, said he had to go to Srinagar and wanted to start the journey early in the day. “I was loading my bags in the car when I heard a big blast and then there were two more blasts. I thought it was ceasefire violation and shelling. But when I looked towards the Brigade headquarters, I could see plumes of smoke and there was sound of continuous firing.”"

(PTI Photo)
MAKING A strong pitch for Muslim support in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year, BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday told the minority community not to “waste” their votes on the Samajwadi Party (SP) or the Congress if they want to defeat the BJP.
She also targeted the BJP government at the Centre, saying the “discrimination against Muslims” has increased since the party came to power, and accused it of trying to gain political mileage from the “terror incidents on India-Pakistan border”.

Addressing a rally here on the occasion of BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s death anniversary, Mayawati said the internal differences in SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s family had weakened the party and divided its supporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Akhilesh ke kheme ke log candidate honge, toh Shivpal ke log andar hi andar unhe haraane ki koshish karenge. Aur agar Shivpal ke kheme ke log candidate honge, toh Akhilesh ke log unhe haraane ki koshish karenge. Muslim samaj ko aise me SP ko apna vote dekar kharab nahi karna hai. (If the candidate is from Akhilesh’s camp, Shivpal’s supporters will try to defeat him. If the candidate is from Shivpal’s camp, Akhilesh’s supporters will try to defeat him. In this situation, the Muslim community should not waste its vote on the SP),” she said.
On the Congress, she said the party does not have a vote base, and voting for it will only benefit the BJP.

She said the Muslim community should, therefore, unitedly vote for the BSP to defeat the BJP. With the state “having 22 to 23 per cent Dalit votes, BSP can win with the help of Muslim votes,” she said. The community should avoid division of its votes, which benefited the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, she said.
Attacking the BJP-led government at the Centre in her 85-minute speech, Mayawati said: “The discrimination against Muslims increased manifold after the formation of the BJP government, and they have been targeted in the name of gau raksha, ghar wapsi, love jehad… The community members are now insecure about protection of their religion, lives and property.”
Citing the incidents in Dadri, Mewat and Una, she said atrocities were being committed against both Muslims and Dalits on the same issue.
Mayawati said “misinformation” was being spread that the BSP may form the next government with BJP’s support. “I trust that the Muslim community will not be misled by this propaganda,” she said. She added that her government would also implement the Supreme Court’s orders on the Ram temple dispute in Ayodhya.
She said the state assembly elections are “a matter of life and death for the BJP, and the party will try all tactics to win them”. “Pradhan Mantri ke August 15 ke bhashan se hi pata lag gaya tha ki wo chunavi swarth ke liye kuch bhi kar sakte hain aur kisi bhi had tak ja sakte hain (PM’s Independence Day speech made it clear that he can go to any extent for electoral benefit),” she said.
“BJP ab Bharat-Pakistan seema par atankwad ki vardaton ko bhi chunav me bhunane ki koshish karegi (BJP is even trying to gain electoral benefits from the terror incidents on India-Pakistan border),” she said.
She said the decision to carry out surgical strikes came late, and such strikes should have been carried out after the Pathankot attack in January. While many countries have carried out surgical strikes, “these foreign governments don’t try to take credit for them, the way this government is trying to take credit for the army’s work in our country,” she said.
Referring to Modi’s scheduled visit to Lucknow on October 11, she said: “Jawanon ki chita ki aag abhi thandi bhi nahi hui hai, aur pradhan mantri Lucknow mein Dussehra manaane aa rahe hain. Wo UP mein Diwali bhi manaane aa sakte hain, jabki BJP ko yeh tyohar dhoomdhaam se nahi… manaane chahiye the. (The funeral pyres of soldiers are still warm, but the PM has decided to come to Lucknow to celebrate Dussehra. He may also come to UP to celebrate Diwali. The BJP should not be observing these festivals with fanfare).”
While 18 soldiers were killed in the Uri attack on September 18, another soldier succumbed to his injuries on September 30.
She said Modi “has set a record of foreign trips but is still unable to clearly spell out the foreign policy because of which the borders of the country are not fully secure. After two years, they have now thought about securing the borders”.
She alleged that the Modi government was working for rich industrialists and capitalists, not for the poor, Dailts and OBCs. She also accused the BJP government of “misusing central agencies like the CBI to harass its opponents” and said the “Congress has also done this earlier.”"

With the controversy surrounding Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam asking proof of the surgical strikes by the Indian Army refusing to die down, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Rameshwar Sharma on Wednesday stirred a fresh controversy with his remark wondering whether such people even ask the video proof of their conception from their parents.
Sharma, the MLA from Bhopal, also said that the language and tone of Kejriwal and Nirupam sound similar to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

“Be it Arvind Kejriwal or Sanjay Nirupam or be it any other leader, those who speak against the Indian Army and those who don’t believe in the army, are those who will only believe in their lineage after watching the video of their parents wedding night,” Sharma said.

“The Indian Army has been sacrificing their lives and blood for the nation and those who don’t believe in them are traitors. They all are Pakistani agents. Their language and tone matches with that of Nawaz Sharif,” he added.
Kejriwal and Nirupam have been facing widespread criticism ever since they asked the Centre to release the video of the September 29 predawn surgical strikes carried out by the army across Line of Control (LoC).
Kejriwal, however, later clarified that the reason behind his demand was to counter the false propaganda of Pakistan, which has been calling the strike as ‘farce’."

The path leading to the two-room Dalui hut was muddy and a neighbour was shovelling dry sand on it while another villager was fixing tubelights on the trees. Jamuna Balai village of Howrah was preparing for the arrival of its martyr, Sepoy Gangadhar Dalui.
“They struggled so much to bring him up well,’’said a neighbour. Dulai had joined the Army two years ago, still in the first year of college.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Inside the hut, women milled around Shikha Dalui, 42. The last time she spoke to her son was Thursday. “He said he wouldn’t be able to call the rest of the week,’’she said. Her husband and younger son had tried to keep the news, saying her son was unwell. “I kept saying he must be okay,” she said, now aware of what had happened. “We had raised him well despite our troubles. God always takes from the poor.”
The Daluis sent their sons Gangadhar and Barun, 15, to Garbaliya R C Manna Institution, the area’s best, managing on the paddy they sold from their fields. When Gangadhar got into the Army, he became the sole breadwinner.
“My brother has always wanted to join the Army,” said Barun, sitting in a room taken over entirely by the only bed in the house. On a small shelf, Gangadhar’s trophies were lined . “My brother took part in every sports event in school and always won.”
It was sports that got Gangadhar into the Army, getting the offer while in college. “He left everything because being in the Army was his dream,’’ said Sheikh Riyazul Rehman, 23, Gangadhar’s classmate and best friend. “Gangadhar was here last month on a vacation. The evening before he left on August 15, we had a feast. We ate meat but he had only ghooghni (chickpeas); he told me that during training, he had heard about cruelty to animals and given up meat.”

Then in a spurt of anger he added, “Pakistan is the worst country in the world. What is our government doing — it is incompetent, ineffective. The Pakistanis know our government is soft… We need to teach them a lesson.”
This was Gangadhar’s first posting in Kashmir and third in his short career. He was posted in Bengaluru and Siliguri before this. “He would talk about the mountains. He would usually talk to his mother,’’ said Gangadhar’s father Onkarnath Dulai, 65.
Onkarnath said Biswajeet Ghorai of Gangasagar, who too died in the terror strike, and his son were good friends. “He gave us a photograph of them together. And now neither boy is alive. I want the government to attack Pakistan. To avenge our sons’ deaths. The mothers of our country are losing their sons. When is our government going to act?” Onkarnath said."

Pakistan’s months-long efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue at the UN have not found any resonance with nations at the world body that are focuser on combating the growing scourge of terrorism, a top Indian diplomat has said.
India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said that what is finding resonance among the international community is the terror threat that India is facing and not what Sharif focussed on his speech – the issue of Kashmir.

“If 131 nations have spoken in the General Debate so far, 130 have not referred to the primary issue that Pakistan has raised. So what does that mean,” he told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said “90 per cent” countries that have spoken at the high-level week of the 71st UN General Assembly session have stressed that terrorism is a primary concern for them, adding that India is gratified by the support it is getting with countries increasingly standing up and voicing their support to deal with the menace of terrorism.
Akbaruddin pointed out that in the plethora of bilateral meetings and multilateral engagements that Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar held on the sidelines of the General Assembly session, “there was resonance” of India being a victim of terrorism and of solidarity with it.
“The resonance of India being a victim of terrorism, India tackling terrorism diligently has gone way beyond distance. In all bilateral meetings, including with Sri Lanka, there has been resonance and immediate response” on the attack on the army base in Uri, he said.
Citing the example of Akbar’s meeting with leaders of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), bloc geographically far from India, the envoy said the participants in that meeting expressed their solidarity with India over the Uri attack and voiced concern over the rise of terrorism.
He said during the meeting of SAARC foreign ministers, Akbar raised the issue of terrorism and how India is countering that. The minister thanked all those who expressed support and condolences to India on the tragic Uri incident.
Adviser to Pakistan Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz had attended the SAARC meeting.
When asked if the ministers from India and Pakistan had any exchange at the meeting, Akbaruddin said the meeting was a luncheon and “they were all at the table”.
Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup said, “the whole world and the entire nation” is waiting to hear from External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj who will deliver India’s national address at the UNGA on September 26.
Swarup did not elaborate on elements of Swaraj’s address but said “you can expect a continued focus from India on the theme of terrorism which is today undoubtedly the single biggest challenge to international peace and security.”
Swaraj is expected to give a stinging response to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s UNGA speech, in which he focused elaborately on Kashmir."

(File)
Lashkar-e-Taiba founder (LeT) and Jamat-ud Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed was Wednesday convicted by a Pakistan court in two terror-financing cases and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison concurrently. Saeed and other leaders of his outfits were booked in July last year under charges of terror financing.
With pressure from the international community building up, Pakistan has been trying to probe operations and functioning of the LeT, its charitable wing JuD, and its other branches, in order to convince the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the Paris-based anti-terror watchdog — that it is taking steps to check terror financing.
Who is Hafiz Saeed?
Hafiz Saeed is the founder and leader of the Islamist terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is a Sunni group that follows the Ahle-Hadith interpretation of Islam. According to Stanford University’s Centre for International Security and Co-operation (CISC), the organisation was founded in 1990 and its goals include conducting jihad in the way of Allah, preaching the true religion and training the new generation along true Islamic lines.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Some of its goals are aligned with that of Pakistan, including the liberation of Kashmir from India.

Saeed is also the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. In an interview he gave to the BBC in 2014, Saeed denied his involvement in the Mumbai attacks, calling the evidence against him “just propaganda” by India. “The people of Pakistan know me and they love me. No one has tried to approach the American authorities to get this bounty [put on his head]. My role is very clear, and God is protecting me,” he told the BBC then.
Other attacks that LeT has been involved in include the 2001 shootout at Parliament House in New Delhi, and, most recently, the 2016 attack on the military headquarters in Uri.
In 2012, in order to support India in its attempt to extradite Saeed, the US State Department offered a bounty of up to $10 million for information that could lead to his arrest or conviction. Moreover, the US Department of the Treasury has marked Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist since 2012.
In the past few years, Saeed has been arrested on multiple occasions. In January 2017, he was arrested by the Pakistani government for raising funds for JuD, thereby violating UN sanctions. He was, however, released in November 2017, when the courts refused to extend the duration of his house arrest due to lack of evidence.
Most recently, Saeed was arrested in July 2019 by Pakistani authorities on charges of terror financing. Since then, he has been detained in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail.

What is the case against Hafiz Saeed?
Under Pakistan’s Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, Saeed, along with other leaders of the JuD, was booked in July in over two dozen cases of terror financing and money laundering registered by the state’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan.
In the 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices, the charges included allegations that JuD was financing terrorism by collecting funds from various non-profit organisations and international Islamist charities, such as Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust and Muaz Bin Jabal Trust.
According to CISC, LeT’s fundraising efforts are “diverse and systematic” and it is not uncommon to find donation boxes for the group in Pakistani markets.

It adds that a type of fundraising method that is unique to LeT is collecting animal skins from religious sacrifices and subsequently selling them in tanneries. As per a Dawn report, JuD earned over $1.2 million from the sale of hides in 2009.
ISI and the Pakistani government too help the LeT bring in funds, and it is believed to have fund-raising offices in Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives and the Gulf region, as per CISC.
Why does Hafiz Saeed conviction matter?
Saeed was arrested by Pakistan’s Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in July 2019 while he was travelling from Lahore to Gujranwala. His arrest came just days before Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was scheduled to visit US President Donald Trump, who had admonished Pakistan for not doing enough to curb terrorism.
Before Saeed’s arrest in February 2019, the FATF had warned Pakistan to deliver on its commitments to curb terror financing. Pakistan feared being a part of FATF’s “Grey List”, which would raise the cost of financial transactions for the country. The FATF placed Pakistan in the grey list in July 2018 nonetheless.
Significantly, if Pakistan did not follow up on FATF’s warnings, it could potentially be downgraded to the Black List, which would make things more difficult for the country. FATF is de facto run by the US Treasury Department.
Saeed’s conviction is perhaps a reflection of Pakistan’s changing approach towards its treatment of terror groups, given the FATF’s actions and warnings.
“Risks to the global financial system virtually put the country’s entire machinery into an aggressive mode to show tangible progress within two months of the warning,” the Dawn report said."

BRICS countries have changed US-dominated post-Cold War world order and emerged as the “balancing influence” in global affairs, the Chinese state media said on Monday even as it criticised India, Brazil and Russia for opposing Chinese investments over “narrow-minded populist sentiments”.
WATCH VIDEO: ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’
 

The BRICS Summit, an increasingly high-profile gathering of leaders from the emerging-market BRICS countries, is becoming a key driver of globalisation, an article titled ‘BRICS create balancing influence in world affairs’ in the state-run Global Times said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“At the same time, the US presidential race appears to be soaked with isolationism and European integration is being shaken by the aftermath of Brexit,” the article said, adding: “Admittedly, BRICS nations have suffered some difficulties amid a worldwide economic downturn, prompting some to think that the BRICS are losing their luster. However, the emerging-market bloc has been transformed from a loose concept into a truly influential entity, and it is having an important impact on the world’s order and globalisation.”

In the political sphere, the BRICS are “helping to change the way in which the global governance model has always been centred around Western developed” economies, it said. “The bloc has changed the post-Cold War world order, in which the global dominance of the US was enshrined, and has more broadly resisted the global hegemony of Western nations.
“BRICS nations, spanning Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, are of pivotal significance for containing Western influence and neo-colonial control, as well as for rectifying the unfair and unrighteous global governance regime,” it said.
The article noted that “there is still substantial room for greater cooperation among the BRICS nations, but it needs to be pointed out that institutional obstacles remain”. “India, Brazil and Russia have not always been truly open in the fields of taxation, labour protection and foreign exchange control, and there are some narrow-minded populist sentiments opposing Chinese investment in these countries,” it said.
“On top of that, despite the well-established industrial chains within BRICS nations, some of them still hold impractical views about building their own systems and excluding China’s influence. If such impediments can’t be removed, it will be hard for the BRICS to embark upon fully open development,” it added.
But at the same, it said BRICS bloc has taken a raft of measures on the economic front – including the signing of trade deals and currency agreements and the establishment of the BRICS bank – that have “dramatically boosted the economic power of non-Western regions and also reshaped globalisation”.
“It turns out that BRICS nations have become a key growth engine for the world economy, and this has resulted in a trend that is seeing globalisation returning to nurture,” it said.
“Third World countries. Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa – the four BRICS nations other than China – are all key partners for China in pushing forward its national strategy of “One Belt and One Road” (Silk Road project),” it added."

Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and top security brass of the country on Monday met to review the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the border areas, in the wake of the terror attack in Uri.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Army Chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag and top officials of the ministries of Home and Defence, paramilitary forces and chiefs of intelligence agencies briefed the meeting on the latest situation in Kashmir Valley as well as along the Line of Control, official sources said.
Parrikar and General Suhag had visited Kashmir on Sunday in the aftermath of the terror attack in Uri where 17 soldiers were killed.

Possible strategies to deal with the fresh challenges arising out of the terror attack at the Army Brigade  headquarters, located along the LoC, was also discussed in the meeting, the sources said.
Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, who has postponed his visit to Srinagar, also attended the meeting.
The Home Minister, Defence Minister and the top officials also reviewed the security situation across the country, particular along the western border –  from Punjab to Gujarat, the sources said.
Meanwhile, a team of National Investigation Agency is expected to visit Uri to gather leads and other evidence from the terror attack site.

Heavily armed militants suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM had on Sunday stormed an army base in Uri in Kashmir, killing 17 jawans.
India had reacted strongly to the deadliest attack on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir in a quarter-century-old insurgency that sparked an outrage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly condemning it.
“We strongly condemn the cowardly terror attack in Uri. I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished,” Modi had said.

The Home Minister, who had yesterday called an emergency meeting in Delhi, had pointed a finger directly at Pakistan, saying it is a “terrorist state” and should be isolated while BJP leader Ram Madhav said days of strategic restraint are over and suggested that “for one tooth, the complete jaw” should be the policy after the attack."

Maintaining that no surgical strikes were conducted in the past and previous actions along the Line of Control were at best covert operations, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said the credit for the September 29 strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir should go to the Indian Army and citizens of the country.

He said the surgical strikes were the result of a “bold” decision taken by the government of the day and it should be “cheered” for that.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Speaking at an event in Mumbai, the Defence Minister said the next response need not be a surgical strike since “unpredictability” keeps the enemy guessing.

“We need surgical strikes but our next response need not be by way of a surgical strike. There should be unpredictability in response. Otherwise, the enemy can study your pattern and prepare its strategy.”
Asked if intelligence failure led to the Uri attack, Parrikar said: “I won’t say there was failure. But yes, there were some shortcomings and we have taken care of it.”

He said if TV channels stop beaming incidents of stone-pelting, such incidents would come down by 75 per cent.
On Opposition criticism that the BJP was trying to take credit for the strikes, he said: “The credit for the surgical strikes go to the Army and 127 crore Indian citizens. We don’t take credit for the surgical strikes. However, it is the government that takes decisions and such a government should be cheered for its bold decisions. I am a citizen, so 1/127crore is my contribution to the strike.”
“There was a feeling of helplessness among 127 crore citizens and 13.5 lakh people in the Army. Frustration was growing that the enemy is continuously bleeding us with thousand cuts. The enemy isn’t bothered if there is an international hue and cry… The enemy is pushing terrorists from across the border. The frustration of 30 years was vented on September 29,” he said.
READ: Manohar Parrikar belittling valour of Indian Army: AAP
Rejecting claims of surgical strikes carried out under previous governments, Parrikar said: “I have been holding this portfolio for two years now. To my knowledge, there were no surgical strikes in the past. Those actions can at best be called covert operations, where action was taken by border action teams, where the local commandant took action against the opponent. In such cases, reports are submitted subsequently to the government. But the September 29 strikes were the result of a government decision.”
He said he did not sleep for three nights ahead of the operations. “During the operations, I kept my mobile phone away, just to ensure that if it is compromised, nobody eavesdrops on important conversations. I mostly switch off my phone during important meetings but one can even bug the battery of your phone and listen to your conversations.”
Describing the current situation “better than 2013”, Parrikar credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for securing the borders. “I should say that the national borders are much more secure under the leadership of the Prime Minister.”
“Prime Minister tried to patch up with Pakistan. He extended a hand of friendship but it was construed by many as a weakness of this government. What we did on September 29 was tell our adversaries that we are not weak,” he said.
Asked about his biggest challenge, Parrikar said it was dealing with scams of the past.
On the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, he said: “During my tenure, there has not been a single case of human rights violation. In cases were there have been some errors of judgment, inquiries are underway and action will be taken accordingly. We have given clear instructions: don’t touch civilians but if somebody comes with a gun, then don’t treat him as a civilian.”
Asked about the procurement policy and limited suppliers, Parrikar said: “There are 18 major companies that supply defence equipment. If we add their cross-holding companies, then this number will rise to 40. If one cross-subsidiary is embroiled in some scam and if we keep banning all of them, then we won’t have a supplier to go to.”
On self-reliance in Defence, Parrikar said it is an imaginary goal. “In small items, we could. But for big equipment, an overall system is developed through supplies from various countries. But in the process, even if we become self-reliant 75 per cent, it is a good achievement,” he said.
Asked if the Defence budget was less than what was needed, he said: “I don’t think money will be a constraint for procuring anything. But I am not in favour of wasteful expenditure. For the first time, we have prepared a graph that projects requirements until 2027.”"

Hitting out at politicians who have demanded proof of the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian army in the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, in retaliation to the Uri attack, Defence Minister Manohar Parrkiar on Thursday said that no one had doubted bravery of our forces ever and the government is not going to oblige them by giving proof of the Army action.
“No one had doubted bravery of our forces ever, but for the first time recently some people are doubting. There are many people who are not loyal to our country and criticized Indian army, but we don’t have to give them any proof,” said Parrikar at a BJP function in Agra.

Parrkiar said that many ex-servicemen have shown willingness to fight on the border if required. “Some ex-servicemen wrote to me and said that they are ready to fight on the border if need arises.I salute them,” said the minister.
Describing the cross-LoC operation as “100 per cent perfect surgical strike”, he said the borders of the country are secure under the Narendra Modi government.
Highlighting the news report of CNN News18 in which a Pakistani police officer has admitted that surgical strikes did happen, Parrikar said, “There is now no more reason to release video or to give any proof.”
He also said that the forces and citizens will have to be vigilant against “frustrated” terrorists who will try and attack because of the shame they have been put to as a result of the surgical strikes.

The wreath laying ceremony of 17 Indian Army soldiers who lost their lives in Sunday’s terrorist attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, will take place in Srinagar on Monday.
In the worst terror attack on security forces, 17 jawans were killed and 20 others injured when four terrorists, later identified to be belonging from Pakistani terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad, sneaked into the administrative building of an army batallion in Uri located near the Line of Control (LoC).
In an encounter that ensued, all four terrorists were neutralised by the forces but army suffered heavy casualties. In a statement issued, the army informed that the heavy losses were due to tents and temporary shelters in which the soldiers were staying, caught fire.

Out of the total 17 martyred jawans, 15 belonged to Bihar regiment and two were from Dogra regiment. The Bihar regiment soldiers had reached Uri on Saturday and were supposed to replace the Dogra regiment soldiers who were already present there.

Meanwhile, initial findings hint that the terrorists came from neighboring Pakistan prompting a stern reply from Indian leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh. While Singh said that Pakistan was a terrorist state and needs to be isolated, Modi warned that perpetrators will not go unpunished."

THE ARMY has lost nearly twice the number of soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir this year as compared to the annual toll in the last two years. While this is mainly due to increase in ceasefire violations, counter-infiltration and Pakistan Army’s Border Action Team (BAT) operations on the Line of Control (LoC), there has also been an increase in the number of soldiers killed in counter-terrorist operations in the state.

According to Defence Ministry sources, 60 soldiers were killed in J&K till December 15 this year — the toll was 33 soldiers in 2015 and 32 in 2014. Of the 60 soldiers who died this year, 23 were killed in operations at the LoC — ceasefire violations, counter-infiltration and BAT operations. In contrast, only four soldiers died on the LoC in 2015, and five in 2014.
Thirty-seven soldiers were killed in counter-terrorist operations in the hinterland, up from the 29 killed in 2015 and 27 in 2014. “The number of dead soldiers is higher this year due to two major terror incidents — one at Uri and another in Nagrota, where we unfortunately lost a total of 26 men,” said an Army official.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the Uri attack, in which 19 soldiers were killed, the Army launched “surgical strikes” on six terror launch-pads across the LoC. This was followed by an increase in the number of ceasefire violations on the LoC, where both sides used heavy weaponry, including artillery guns, in ground fire.
During his visit to Northern Command headquarters at Udhampur last month, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was shown a four-minute-long video of the high intensity firing on Pakistani posts at the LoC. The Pakistan Army has also shared videos and photographs of heavy action on Indian posts on the LoC. There has, however, been a decline in the number of ceasefire violations in the past three weeks.
“Our posts on the LoC are better prepared than the Pakistanis. These posts are in much better shape and, despite their best attempts, our casualties have been limited. An active LoC will always have more chances of casualties than a non-active one,” said a top Army official from Udhampur.
As much as the top Army leadership understands the importance of the LoC ceasefire, it feels that there was no choice but to retaliate after the Uri attack. The only question raised, top Army sources said, was whether such retaliation “was part of a policy or just a one-off thing”.
Top Army sources admitted that there has been a rise in terror incidents in the Valley. Over 100 terrorists have been killed this year, sources said, and more infiltration attempts have been made at the LoC.
Meanwhile, all the top Army formations in J&K have seen a leadership change in recent months. Earlier this month, Lt General Devraj Anbu took over as the new GOC-in-C at Udhampur-headquartered Northern Command, which looks after the whole of J&K, following the retirement of Lt General D S Hooda.
Srinagar-based 15 Corps, which is responsible for areas in J&K north of Pir Panjal ranges, saw a change of command last month when Lt General J S Sandhu replaced Lt General Satish Dua. In October, Lt General A K Sharma took over the responsibility for areas south of Pir Panjal as 16 Corps Commander from Lt General R R Nimbhorkar.
“Our processes and systems are already institutionalised. Personalities definitely matter at that level, but only to a limited extent. We should not worry about so many senior-level changes in such a short period affecting the Army operations in J&K in any major way,” said sources."

For his family, the sense of impending doom was not without reason. A while before the news broke, the soldier’s father, Harnek Singh, had received a call from the Army for details of his son.
By 9 pm on Friday, the villagers’ worst fears were confirmed: Sukhwinder Singh was among the eight Armymen  killed in the militant attack. “We got a call from his unit and they wanted details about Sukhwinder, as if they were confirming if they were calling the right man’s family. They did not tell us anything else. But we saw news… So we all had started preparing for bad news,” said Harnek Singh.
The family’s pain is compounded by the fact that Sukhwinder, who joined the Army 11 years ago, had applied for leave this month, to attend a wedding, but then postponed it as he wanted to attend another marriage next year and was also hopeful of being transferred closer home."

Amit Mehra
In late July, when Jamila and her husband boarded the Samjhauta Express to Pakistan, unrest was spreading in the Valley and Islamabad was being blamed for fuelling the violence on the streets. Somewhat worried, Jamila, however, decided to make the journey — her nephew was getting married in Karachi and this was going to be one big family gathering.
In the early hours of Tuesday, Jamila and her husband returned home, two among the 138 passengers on board the Samjhauta Express from Pakistan. On Platform No. 1 of Old Delhi railway station, greetings and hugs seemed a little far away from the war of words in the wake of the Uri attack.

As he waited for the train to pull in, Jamila’s brother Nazim Abbasi, a 50-year-old from Daryaganj who deals in auto parts, said: “The Uri attack frightened us. Jamila advanced her return by a month and decided to take the first train home. We were afraid that the Samjhauta service would be suspended because of the rising tension.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The situation does not look good. It is a masla (problem). Jang toh koi hal nahin hai, jang apne mein hi masla hai (war is never a solution, it is in itself a problem). There are relatives on both sides. No one wants war. Friends can be changed, not neighbours. So, Pakistan should behave like a neighbour in its dealings with India,” Abbasi said.
On the platform, where an overhead digital time board flashed ‘Welcome’ and ‘Swagatam’, Mohammed Farooq, a trader from Sultanpur in UP, too waited for his sister and her husband. Nasim and Farid also cut short their visit to sister Muzamil’s house in Lahore.
“My mother went against my father’s wishes and got my sister Muzamil married into the family of a neighbour who had moved to Pakistan in 1947. We wanted nothing to do with Pakistan but my mother said that through marital ties, ‘rishtedaari kayam reh jayegi’ between the two countries,” Farooq said. He last visited his sister in Lahore in 1991. “India should never have been partitioned… Look at what Pakistan has become.”
Shamim Begum, 55, was visiting India after a decade. With her was daughter Ammara. From Shamli in western UP, Shamim married into a family settled in Multan. She moved to Pakistan where she gave birth to Ammara and Saina.
“Back home, Internet and WhatsApp are full of rumours about tensions rising and a war imminent. My daughter and I had already applied for the visa. But there is nothing wrong here in India. Everything seems fine,” Shamim said. “No one wants war, either here or there. But people feel very strongly about their nation.”
Ammara had other complaints. The long journey and the security checks had been wearisome. “There were so many security personnel, and they were very rough with our belongings. And at a point before we entered India, we heard news about protests in Punjab against the train carrying us to India. But the train continued,” she said, complaining that her slippers were stolen when she and her mother fell asleep.
Most families on board were those returning from family weddings. Others made the journey to attend funerals. But some like Mohammed Khalid (52) were visiting Delhi. He had last travelled to India 25 years ago to see what was left of what once used to be the family home in Bhiwani. This time, he convinced friends Ahmad, Mehraj and Karamal, all traders from Multan with families and friends in India, to take a break and holiday in Delhi."

Bollywood superstar Salman Khan seems to be backing Pakistani actors who have been facing severe criticism and a possible ban after the Uri attack on an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir leading to the death of 19 security forces. On boycott of Pakistani actors like Fawad Khan in Bollywood, Salman said,”They are artistes not terrorists. It’s the government who gives them permits and visas.”

Ever since the September 18 attacks on the Army camp in Uri by Pakistani terrorists, there have been calls from all over India for a ban on Pakistani artistes working here. Mumbai-based Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA) on Friday had even passed a resolution to ban Pakistani actors from the industry in the wake of the Uri attack. In Mumbai, Raj Thackeray’s MNS party had last week issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Pakistani artistes and actors including Fawad Khan and Ali Zafar, to leave India or else they would be “pushed out”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Other actors such as Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar also praised the Indian Army on the surgical strikes conducted along the Line of Control.
While there was support for Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood from all over the industry, some have questioned their place in the country, including CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani.
“Jab Pakistan humare kalakaron ko jagah nahi deta toh hum kyun sentimental ho jaayein? (When Pakistan doesn’t allow our actors to work in their country, why should we get sentimental?),” news agency ANI quoted Nihalani as saying.
The censor board chief though ruled out preventing the release of movies of producers who have cast Pakistani artistes.
“Karan Johar and other filmmakers signed Pakistani actors when relations(India-Pak) were fine,so would be wrong to try & stop their film release now,” Nihalani added.
Meanwhile, MNS and Shiv Sena have continued to voice against Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood with MNS threatening violence against them.

 
“If we find any Pakistani artist working here, we will beat them up,” Amey Khopkar of MNS said on Friday.
“We have a population of 1.25 billion, why do we have to import artists from Pakistan?” said Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant regarding Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood.
Shiv Sena’s Subhash Desai even responded to Salman Khan’s statements on Friday saying,”Salman Khan should consult with his father Salim Khan before making such statements.”"

In the aftermath of the Uri attacks, a lot has changed between India and Pakistan. While several groups in India are adamant to enforce a complete ban on Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood, Indian television channel Zindagi, also pulled down all the Pakistani shows that were on air. In the light of the looming issue, Pakistan also struck back. According to a report in The Nation, Pakistani people have demanded action against “all Indian channels”. Taking their demand on a serious note the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had ordered that no Indian TV channel can be viewed in the country after October 15. According to the reports, the crackdown will be held against all cable operators in the country in case the orders are not followed. It also alleged that Pakistani programmes have been banned in India and Indian artistes have given negative messages against Islamabad which resulted in provoking the public to demand the closure of Indian channels.

(Source: Reuters)
IN THE wake of a series of terror attacks in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani spoke over telephone on Wednesday and “discussed the need for an end to terrorist sanctuaries” in the “neighbourhood” — a clear reference to Pakistan.
The conversation took place even as news reports claimed that Ghani had refused to take a phone call from Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday — the reports were denied by an Afghan diplomat.
South Block sources told The Indian Express that the 20-minute conversation between Modi and Ghani reflected the “shared concern” of New Delhi and Kabul, and a “meeting of minds” in assessing Islamabad’s role in Afghanistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“There was complete consensus after the Uri attacks in 2016, when the Afghan President took the lead in pulling out of the SAARC summit in Islamabad that year. The rest had followed, isolating Pakistan in the region. The latest conversation between the top two leaders is a manifestation of that convergence of views,” sources told The Indian Express.
Sources said Wednesday’s conversation between the two leaders was not a “one-off” but a “regular feature”.
While there was no official word from New Delhi, Ghani posted on his Twitter account: “PM Modi called me to offer condolences on the recent senseless killings of civilians across (sic) #AFG by the enemies of humanity. We discussed the need for an end to terrorist sanctuaries in our neighbourhood. India has always been a good friend of Afghans, sharing our pain and grief.”
Leading Afghan news outlet Tolo News reported that Abbasi reached out to Ghani on Tuesday night “in connection with the spate of recent attacks in Afghanistan” but received no response. However, Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan Omar Zakhilwal denied that such a phone call had taken place.
“Not true — no phone call has taken place. Following recent horrific terrorist attacks in Kabul, PM Abassi conveyed a message to President Ghani to which it was responded to by high-powered personal delegation by the President to meet the PM today,” he tweeted.
Ghani had sent a delegation to Islamabad “to hand over evidence related to recent attacks in Kabul” to be shared with the Pakistan Army. The high-level delegation comprised the interior minister and the intelligence chief, Pakistan newspaper Dawn reported.
Kabul has been hit by a series of terror attacks over the last 10 days, which has claimed around 150 lives and injured hundreds more. On Monday, Islamic State militants attacked Afghan soldiers guarding a military academy in Kabul killing at least 11 troops and wounding 16.
On January 20, in an assault reminiscent of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, Taliban armed with Kalashnikovs and suicide vests attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and killed around 25 people, going from room to room searching for foreigners during a more than 12-hour ordeal.
The hotel attack was followed by a Taliban-claimed ambulance bombing on January 27 in the Afghan capital that claimed over 100 lives, mostly civilians.
The Afghan government has blamed the attack on the dreaded Haqqani Network. After the ambulance bombing, India strongly condemned the “barbaric and dastardly terrorist attacks” in Kabul, saying that it “stands ready to extend all possible assistance, including for treatment of those injured”.
Afghanistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Mahmoud Saikal has accused Pakistan’s spy agency, the ISI, of training a terrorist involved in the attack in Kabul’s Intercontinental Hotel.
In the recent past, India-Afghanistan relations have been strengthened by the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in October 2011.
Subsequently, when Modi visited Afghanistan on December 25, 2016, India gifted four Mi-25 attack helicopters to the Afghan Air Force. On June 4, 2016, Modi visited Herat in western Afghanistan to jointly inaugurate the Afghan-India Friendship Dam, earlier known as Salma Dam, along with Ghani.
Ghani paid a working visit to India on September 14-15, 2016, and in October 2017. India had announced last year that it would take up 116 community development projects in 31 Afghan provinces."

Influential US Senator John McCain telephoned former president and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and discussed bilateral and regional issues, including the tension between Pakistan and India. “Issues relating to the current situation as a result of war of words and hype in Indian propaganda against Pakistan were also discussed during their conversation last evening,” the former president’s spokesman Farhatullah Babar said today.
Zardari told the American senator that Pakistan never supported terrorists and his Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and all Pakistanis have always condemned terrorists. He alleged that “India wants to hide its atrocities over innocent Kashmiris by this propaganda”. The former president said that “Pakistan wants a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue through dialogue and in accordance with the wishes of the people of Kashmir”.

“Dialogue is the only way forward,” Zardari told McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee in the 2008 election. 18 Indian soldiers were killed when terrorists attacked a highly-guarded army camp in Uri in Kashmir on Sunday. India has said it has evidence showing involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the Uri attack.
The incident triggered a diplomatic dust-up with both India and Pakistan hitting out at each other including at the UN General Assembly."

Ten days after the surgical strikes along the Line of Control, the government is confident it has made the point to Pakistan that any covert operation will be at a high cost. Islamabad’s international isolation on cross-border terrorism after the Uri attack has also given New Delhi diplomatic conviction to launch a similar counter-offensive in case of a repeat misadventure by Pakistan.
“India has raised the stakes, we have raised the cost for Pakistan. There is a possibility of this (surgical strikes) becoming an ‘acceptable norm’. For Pakistan, terrorist strikes or covert operations were a low- risk, low-cost option all along. This has changed now. We don’t want escalation, but we have set a precedent,” a top government official said.
According to the official, the government is now focused on the more important task of ‘consequences management’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are working on the premise that there will be retaliation. Various options are being worked on to make it impossible for the Pakistan army to strike back. We are minimising our response time and raising our tactical capabilities,” the official said, emphasising that ‘consequences management’ required a much more professional approach. In the last two years, the government has also been addressing the deficiency on the acquisition and procurement front, the official said.
Responding to reports in Pakistan media about differences between the civilian government and the army in Pakistan, the official said the Uri attack and subsequent surgical strikes by India gave an opportunity to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to make the country’s military realise the country’s international isolation.
“One country was sufficient to derail the SAARC summit. The international community unanimously condemned cross-border terrorism. We made a self-admission of LoC violation. Nobody said we were wrong. Not even China. Russia, in fact, gave a strong statement against Pakistan,” the official said.
The official said the cost of world alienation due to terrorist strikes has surely sunk in within the Pakistan establishment. “The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi has accepted our invitation to be the Chief Guest for the Republic Day function in India,” the official pointed out, indirectly pointing to India’s well thought-out and all-round diplomatic offensive to put pressure on Pakistan.
Drawing parallels with the terrorist attack in Mumbai, the official noted that the 2008 attack had forced India to be continuously on alert. “The surgical strikes have done more than that to Pakistan. There is a cost of mobilisation. They need to be perpetually on alert now. Their state of preparedness too has to be high,” the official said.
Emphasising that India has “strong credible evidence” of the surgical strikes, the official said there was “no advantage” in releasing it.
The official maintained this was the first time India launched a surgical strike of this nature. “Earlier, we may have launched operations to stave off a terrorist strike or while chasing them back on their way back, but this is the first time we struck with such surgical precision,” the official said.
To Pakistan’s denial of surgical strikes, the official said, “In a strategic sense, nothing suits us more than this.” The official, however, pointed to the flurry of activity in Pakistan after India’s announcement. “The mobilisation there, commanders’ meetings, cabinet meeting, sending ambassadors abroad, etc, all suggest something else,” the official said."

BJP president Amit Shah said on Sunday that “more than 250 terrorists” were killed in the airstrike in Balakot on February 26.
“After the Uri attack, the army did a surgical strike. After the Pulwama attack, people said there could not be a surgical strike due to the high level of alertness. But on the 13th day, the Narendra Modi government carried out an airstrike, and more than 250 terrorists were killed without suffering any losses,” Shah said.

Speaking at an event here, he said: “When (Wing Commander) Abhinandan Varthaman was caught, they (Opposition) started again. But the Narendra Modi government’s impact was such that for the first time in the world, a PoW was released in such a short time… Abhinandan was released within 48 hours.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shah said India has become only the third country in the world, after the United States and Israel, to avenge attacks on its armed forces.

Addressing another event in Surat, Shah said the Opposition had brought a “smile” to Pakistan’s face by questioning the airstrike. “Mamata says where is the evidence; Rahul says it is being politicised; Akhilesh says it should be investigated. I have to say shame on them. Your statements have brought a smile to Pakistan’s face… If you can’t stand in support of Modi and the armed forces, then at least learn to keep quiet,” he said.
“When the Indian Air Force laid out the facts at a press conference… if we don’t believe that, then, as a citizen of this country, we should be ashamed. Those who are asking for proof are helping Pakistan and strengthening its intentions,” he said in Ahmedabad.

“They (Opposition) have set an agenda for the elections — gathbandhan ki sarkar — but who will be the leader, what is their ideology, policies, programmes?

A three-day International Sikh Conclave ended in Patna on Saturday with Governor Ram Nath Kovind making an appeal to the participants to visit Patna to celebrate the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh in January next. “It is a matter of great opportunity and challenge for the state government to organise the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj as ‘Prakash Parv’ who was the 10th Guru of Sikhs,” Kovind said while addressing the valedictory session of the conclave organised by state Tourism Department.

Stating that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism evolved and grew in Bihar, Kovind said the state is the birth place of Guru Govind Singh.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his Punjab counterpart Parkash Singh Badal on September 22 inaugurated the Sikh Conclave, the first of its kind. They released a book dedicated to Guru Gobind Singh.
Badal gave a cheque of Rs 10 crore to Kumar to set up a building to accommodate people coming to Patna to participate in the ‘Prakash Parv’.
The Conclave was attended by eminent Sikh personalities from the country and abroad that included union minister S S Ahluwalia, Uttar Pradesh B R Ramuwalia, former union minister S S Dhindsa, former chairman of National Minorities Commission Tarlochan Singh, Patna Saheb Jathedar Iqbal Singh, Ruby Dhalla, ex MP of House of Commons of Canada, R S Sandhu, and Deputy Lord Lieutenant, Licestershire, UK.

India on Thursday said it will review the Most Favoured Nation status granted to Pakistan by it based on the security and trade interests, asserting that terror cannot be the commodity exported.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup also said that the speech by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailing Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani in Parliament shows Pakistan’s complicity in terrorism directed against India and was “self implicating”. Sharif had hailed Wani as “son of the Kashmiri soil” while addressing the joint session yesterday.
“Promoting shared prosperity with neighbours has been government’s priority but terror cannot be the commodity exported. We will undertake a review based on our security and trade interests,” he said when asked if India will review the MFN status given to Pakistan by India, unilaterally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about the recent conversation between the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan, he said the Prime Ministers of the two countries had in January agreed that their NSAs will remain in touch and the details should not be made public. “India remains committed not to make it public.”
Earlier this week, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz was quoted as saying by Pakistani media that India has agreed to reduce tensions after their NSAs spoke over phone. This was first such contact after the Uri attack and India’s retaliatory surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the LoC.
Swarup also refused to react to the reports in Pakistani media that Sharif has asked the powerful military not to shield banned militant groups and directed authorities to conclude the Pathankot terror attack probe and the 2008 Mumbai attack trials.
On the reports that Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), a umbrella group of jihadi and Islamist outfits as Hafiz Saeed’s JeM, organising a rally in Pakistan on October 28, he said India has always voiced its concerns at the freedom available to such internationally designated terrorists in Pakistan to conduct and promote anti India activities openly.
“It is up to the government of Pakistan to abide by its assurances that it will deny the use of its territory for such purposes,” he added.
Swarup also described as “inflection point” the recent cancelling of SAARC Summit after several countries of the eight-nation grouping pulled out over the cross-border terrorism as till now some were only doing “lip-service” and not doing anything concrete."

Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar led the cast of Pink, including megastar Amitabh Bachchan, and the media here in observing a minute’s silence on Wednesday in memory of the Indian soldiers martyred in the terrorist attack at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir.
More from the world of Entertainment:

 
“It’s a bad and a painful incident that has happened and we are with the soldiers and their families. Let’s wait (for India’s decision). We really didn’t like what happened… It was really horrible,” Sircar said at a promotional for “Pink”.
Directed by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury and co-produced by Sircar, the film, which released on September 16, also features Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Andrea Tariang, Angad Bedi, Piyush Mishra and Dhritiman Chatterjee in key roles.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Taapsee, Roy Chowdhury and Bedi, who were present at the media meet, stood up with the rest of the crew in attendance.
Eighteen soldiers were killed when militants believed to have come from Pakistan attacked an army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday. The killings have sent India-Pakistan relations plunging to a new low.
Also, dubbing the stabbing of a 21-year-old woman teacher in New Delhi as a “horrible” incident, megastar Amitabh Bachchan on Wednesday emphasised that society has to change.
“I have seen that video… It’s a bad incident. Society has to change. We have to keep trying. Everybody just says that ‘this is not my job and I am not interested in it’,” he noted.
“A lot of people are afraid to help somebody because they feel they will be victimised in the police station. They don’t want to get involved,” Bachchan said here at a promotional for “Pink”.
The woman named Karuna, of Burari area in north Delhi, was a teacher at Novel Reaches School. She was on Tuesday morning fatally stabbed as many as 22 times by her “jilted” lover.
However, Amitabh noted that society is “slowly” transforming and the laws are changing as well.

“But all these things are changing. The law is changing. I think people, when the moment they see some disaster, they are not liable to be questioned, if they bring that person either to the hospital or the police station,” he said.
“When something happens on the road, most of the time people just drive past because they feel scared. But now there is a lot of understanding and laws are also changing,” he added."

Nearly a week after the Uri attack that killed 18 soldiers, the Army on Saturday said that it has arrested two PoK nationals “working for (the) Jaish-e-Mohammad” terror outfit and “acting as guides for infiltrating groups along the Line of Control in the Uri sector”.
Spokesperson Col Rajesh Kalia said that the PoK nationals — identified as Ahasan Kursheed of Khaliana Kalan and Faisal Hussain Awan of Pottha Jahangir — were arrested by BSF and Army on Wednesday.

Sources said the two were arrested near the Jamun post close to the LoC. They added that the two were 15-16 years old and had no role in the Uri attack.
The spokesperson said that the PoK nationals were recruited two years ago and that information provided by them were being corroborated by agencies."

(Source: ANI)
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday arrived here ahead of the BRICS-Bimstec Outreach Summit and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Hasina landed in Goa at 10:30 a.m. and was greeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“Honoured to host you PM Hasina for BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit. We cherish the strong ties between India and Bangladesh and applaud your role,” Modi said. The two leaders will hold a meeting later in the day to discuss a wide spectrum of bilateral relations.
Hasina will attend a ceremonial lunch hosted by Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar for all participants of BIMSTEK, before the heads of the member states hold talks over related issues. As host of this year’s BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Summit, India, as is the practice, can invite neighbouring countries to join in for an outreach summit.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Following the September 18 terror attack at an Indian Army camp in Uri town of Jammu and Kashmir, which left 19 soldiers dead, India chose to invite countries belonging to the Bimstec grouping over those of the Saarc. Countries belonging to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) are India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed militant group for the Uri attack and launched a diplomatic blitz to isolate Islamabad in the international community. The invitation to Bimstec countries instead of the Saarc nations is being seen as another step in this direction. Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Maldives are the members of the South Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) which are not the members of Bimstec."

The killing of at least 40 CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district Thursday in the worst terror attack the Valley has seen, has reignited the debate on active militancy in the area, the preparedness of intelligence agencies, the diplomatic roadblock by China to bring Masood Azhar, head of Jaish-e-Mohammad which has claimed responsibility of the attack, to justice, and the political ramifications in the time of general elections.

The attack, condemned by world leaders, especially by the United States, has put pressure on Pakistan to stop providing safe havens to terror groups. The attack also puts focus on fidayeen attacks by the Pakistan-based terror group and what challenges lie ahead for the paramilitary forces which took over the law and order duties in the state from the BSF in 2005. Explained: India withdraws Most Favoured Nation status to Pak — how Pak’s economy will be hurthttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After a cabinet committee of security meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday, the PM said “those behind the heinous crime will have to pay”. Pulwama terror attack LIVE updates
The car bombing
On Thursday afternoon, a suicide bomber rammed his Scorpio SUV laden with explosives into a CRPF bus in south Kashmir where a convoy of 78 vehicles, carrying over 2,500 jawans were moving to Kashmir from Jammu. Most of the men were returning from leave to join duty in Srinagar, said sources. The convoy had started from 3.30 AM from Jammu to reach Kashmir. About 35 kilometres from Srinagar, at around 3.30 PM at the Jammu-Kashmir highway, a Scorpio SUV laden with explosives is suspected to have emerged from a side road to hit the bus at a right angle.

“A car suddenly came in the middle of the convoy and there was a huge explosion,” said a CRPF man who was travelling in another vehicle that was part of the convoy. “When we came down, the bus was not there. It had been completely charred and the bodies were scattered all around”.
For CRPF, Pulwama attack a ‘massive setback’, a new challenge
A resident of Lethpora told The Indian Express that the explosion seemed to shake the ground beneath. “We were sitting at home when there was a deafening bang and the earth shook,” he said. “It was so powerful that we were thrown away from the place we were sitting”. The national highway was then closed for traffic and the media barred from moving towards the explosion site. Mobile internet services were snapped in south Kashmir and Jammu, while the data speed in Srinagar was scaled down to 2G.
Security sources said while the Intelligence Bureau did not have any input about an impending attack, all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were followed. A road opening party was sent before the movement of the convoy. The whole route was sanitised. IEDs were ruled out. How this attack happened still, is now in the realm of investigations,” CRPF IG (Operations), Kashmir, Zulfikar Hassan said.
Pulwama attack worst in Valley
The terror attack at paramilitary forces in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district Thursday is the worst the Valley has seen.
Before Thursday’s attack, the most casualty suffered by CRPF in an attack was on June 25, 2016, when a vehicle was attacked by three LeT militants, leaving eight personnel dead and 22 injured.

(Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)
The scale of Thursday’s attack can be gauged from the fact that in the whole of 2018, CRPF did not lose as many men as it did on Thursday. According to the Union Home Ministry’s figures, CRPF lost 30 men in terror attacks in 2018. Governor Satya Pal Malik said that the attack was partly the result of an intelligence failure, especially due to the fact that security forces could not detect the loading and movement of the explosive-laden Scorpio.
India says will make Pakistan pay
After holding a cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday said those who committed the heinous act will pay “a heavy price”. “Those who did the heinous act will have to pay a heavy price. Those who supported it will definitely be punishment,” PM Modi said. “To all my colleagues, in ruling and Opposition, it’s a sensitive time. We need to speak in one voice because this battle is for us to win,” he said.
Following the CCS meet, India decided to withdrew the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan. Briefing the media in New Delhi, senior Cabinet minister Arun Jaitley said the Ministry of External Affairs will launch an all-out effort to isolate Pakistan for orchestrating the dastardly attack on the CRPF personnel.
“The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will initiate all possible diplomatic steps which are to be taken to ensure the complete isolation from the international community of Pakistan of which incontrovertible is available of having a direct hand in this act,” Jaitley said, adding that it will withdraw the MNF status granted to the neighbouring country in 1996.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh will head to Jammu to take stock of the situation. On Thursday, he blamed Pakistan for the attack and said a “strong reply” will be given to them in retaliation. BJP general secretary Ram Madhav told The Indian Express the immediate priority for India would be to make Pakistan accountable for the attack.
Meanwhile, Pakistan said the terrorist attack in Pulwama district is “a matter of grave concern” even as it strongly rejected Indian media and government’s allegations of the country’s link to the strike “without” probe.
‘Stand with govt’: Parties come together to condemn Pulwama attack
Congress president Rahul Gandhi Friday said the party is “fully supporting the government” to bring perpetrators of the attack to justice. “This is a time of mourning, sadness, and respect. We are fully supporting the government of India and our security forces. We are not going to get into any other conversation apart from this,” he said.
Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said the country will not compromise with terror forces. “Today is the day of mourning. Our country has lost close to 40 armed forces jawans and our foremost duty is to convey to their families that we are with them. We shall never compromise with the terrorist forces,” he said.
In view of the attack, all political programmes of BJP leaders, including PM Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, scheduled for Friday have been cancelled. AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also cancelled her press conference Thursday, saying “it was not the time for politics”.
The Congress also cancelled the scheduled luncheon meeting on Friday that Rahul was to have with the heads of missions of G-20 countries and envoys of neighbouring nations. Condemning the attack, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “It is unfortunate that terrorism is again raising its ugly head in Jammu and Kashmir and precious lives of our paramilitary forces have been lost.”
Expressing solidarity with the families of the slain CPRF personnel, leaders across the political spectrum condemned the deadly attack in Pulwama and asked the government to take strong steps, including initiation of political process, to reach out to all stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir.
International community condemns attack
Condemnations came in from the US, UK, UN, France, Russia, Israel, Canada, Germany, Australia, Thailand, Turkey and, among the neighbours, Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The White House asked Pakistan to immediately end “support” and “safe haven” to all terror groups as it strongly condemned the Pulwama terrorist attack.
“The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a late night statement on Thursday. Condemning the attack, the US State Department said in a statement that it was “resolutely committed” to working with the Indian government to combat terrorism in all its forms.
How and why Jaish-e-Mohammad is upping its deadly act
Car bombing is not new to Jaish. In the spring of 2000, seventeen-year-old schoolboy Afaq Ahmad drove an explosive-laden Maruti into the headquarters of the Army’s 15 Corps in Srinagar. The car exploded at the gate as the boy panicked. This announced the entry of Jaish, then newly formed by Maulana Masood Azhar who was released in 1999 by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in exchange of the crew and passengers of the hijacked IC-814 plane at Kandahar.

China’s repeated stalling of efforts by India and the US to blacklist Azhar have also boosted Jaish’s three-year-long campaign to revive itself in Jammu and Kashmir.
Jaish’s first major strike that pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war was the 2001 Parliament attack. In January 2016, it was behind the attack on the Pathankot airbase in which seven security personnel were killed. And the September 2016 Uri attack in which 20 soldiers were killed. New Delhi subsequently responded with a surgical strike across the LoC.
The Pak-based Jaish — Azhar is based in Bahawalpur — has its umbilical cord linked to the Taliban. Soon after 9/11, when Islamabad sided with the US, Jaish took it on. In fact, the Jaish suicide attack on the J&K Assembly in Srinagar soon after 9/11 that killed 23 was the first attack in Kashmir to be officially condemned by Pakistan."

Diplomacy has been one of the focus areas of the government led by Narendra Modi, even before he took charge as Prime Minister. From inviting SAARC leaders for his swearing-in ceremony to holding back-to-back informal summits with Chinese and Russian Presidents, the government’s diplomatic outreach has traveled a long way in the last four years. It has witnessed ups and downs in its relationships with various countries and has had to adapt to the changes in the relationship.

What’s Done
The government has made a concerted effort to reach out to all 192 countries. As declared by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, almost every country had to be visited by a ministerial-level delegation during the term. At last count, ministers had been able to visit about 185 countries, leaving only a handful to be covered in the next 12 months.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-5186820 alignleft"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/the-last-lap-400.jpg"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""222"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/the-last-lap-400.jpg 400w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/the-last-lap-400.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" />https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While the length and breadth of the outreach has been commendable, in some aspects the outreach has been done through highly publicised events — be it the India-Africa Forum summit, the International Solar Alliance in India, or the large diaspora events in almost every visit by the Prime Minister, starting from Madison Square Garden in New York.
India has upgraded its aid commitments, especially in the neighbourhood, to almost $25-30 billion, in its bid to be seen as a reliable partner.
New Delhi’s management of big-power relationships has been leader-driven since Modi has engaged with world leaders at bilateral and multi-lateral summits — G-20, UNGA, ASEAN-India and East Asia summits, BRICS and SCO summits.
India has a robust relationship with the US, which under the Donald Trump administration has been quite tough on Pakistan.

West Asia, too, got a fair share of attention, with all the regional rivals being engaged separately — Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE, Qatar, Palestine. In the process, New Delhi has also been able to carefully de-hyphenate its ties with Tel Aviv and Ramallah.
Engagement with Southeast Asia got a fillip in the last Republic Day, when 10 ASEAN leaders attended the showpiece event in India’s diplomatic calendar.

And, in a more recent phenomenon, informal summits — with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and an informal stopover meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel — seem to have emerged as a new template.
What’s in Progress
After the big-bang decision to invite all SAARC leaders, India’s engagement with its neighbors is the key “work in progress” after four years of the Modi government.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-5191606 alignleft"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/india-foreign.jpg"" alt="""" width=""397"" height=""244"" />
While talks with Pakistan witnessed highs and lows, the relationship reached a new low after Pathankot and Uri attacks and the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. Sporadic attempts have been made to keep the engagement alive, but India is now waiting for Pakistan’s elections to be completed this year and will largely depend on the next incumbent.
China has been one of the most difficult relationships in the last four years, and last year’s Doklam crisis prompted India to attempt a “reset” in the relationship. The government’s diktat to not attend the Dalai Lama’s events, and subsequent informal summit in Wuhan was aimed at rapprochement with Beijing. Doklam also tested India’s friendship with Bhutan, but Thimphu stood strong with New Delhi.
Its relationship with Nepal was marred by the blockade during the Madhesi agitation, and now with PM K P Oli in power, it will be a test of the relationship, although India has opened new areas of cooperation in connectivity, agriculture.

Ties with Maldives have nose-dived, and it is the only country in the neighborhood to not have been visited by Prime Minister Modi.

India’s outreach to Latin America has been a blind spot for the administration, even as there have been some ministerial visits.

Pakistan’s efforts to forge an united political front against India received a rude shock on Tuesday when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan announced boycott of the joint session saying participation would mean “endorsing” leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Sharif last week called the joint session of bicameral parliament on Wednesday to discuss tensions with India after India conducted surgical strikes on terror launch pads in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Imran said after party meeting that participation in the session would mean “endorsing” leadership of Sharif whom he wants to remove from office over alleged corruption.
“We have a clear line on the prime minister. We thought if we attend tomorrow, we would be endorsing him. But he has lost his moral authority because of the Panama leaks,” he said.
Imran said that Sharif had also failed to implement the National Action Plan announced after Peshawar school attack to remove militancy.
He also blasted Sharif for failing to give forceful response to India in recent tension.

“When there was a ruckus after the Uri attack, where was Nawaz Sharif?” he asked.
“He was shopping in Gucci in London, whereas he should have provided leadership in Pakistan. There was no response from here,” he said.
Imran repeated that Sharif has lost legitimacy as the prime minister after his family was mentioned in Panama leaks as having foreign properties."

A day after Navjot Kaur Sidhu quit the BJP, party’s Punjab chief and union minister Vijay Sampla on Sunday said that ‘the party in fact tolerated the indisciplined Sidhu couple for too long which wasn’t required’.
Reacting to Sidhu’s remark that she felt ‘suffocated’ in BJP and thus resigned, Sampla said, “BJP accommodated and respected Sidhu couple as much as it was possible for us. In fact, I think it got too stretched and we even tolerated their indiscipline for too long which wasn’t our obligation. Everyone today knows and will agree with the fact that they never felt suffocated in BJP. She (Navjot Kaur) continued speaking against the party even being a part of it. I do not think someone can show this level of patience which BJP showed.”

“She expressed her opinion freely always. She never minced her words or was asked to do so. So if this is suffocation, then we do not know what freedom is. I think we gave them all the due respect and even more than what they deserved. Rest it was their call to resign from the party,” said Sampla during a fuction to inaugurating the Patanjali mega store of Baba Ramdev in Ludhiana.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about BJP trying to gain mileage and politicize surgical strikes conducted across LOC by the army, Sampla said “earlier people used to question that where is the 56 inch chest of PM Narendra Modi which he boasted of.”
“Today, we have given a befitting reply to the terrorism and every Indian is feeling proud of it. Today, I think the 56-inch chest of Modi is here for all to see. Army has got a shot in their arm and entire nation is standing behind them. People are seeing that promises made to them have been fulfilled and PM has revenged Uri attack as he vowed. The point is that both AAP and Congress are fluttering in jealousy because they have nothing else to say or do,” said Sampla.
“People like Arvind Kejriwal are trying their best to demotivate the army and people in border villages of Punjab. People need not give him any importance,” he said.
On being asked about BJP promoting Ramdev and his FMCG firm Patanjali, Sampla said that ‘as long as something is Swadeshi (made in India), he and party will promote it.’ “It is not about Ramdev. As long as a company gives boost to Made In India, we will not hesitate to promote it,” said Sampla."

Uri released in theaters on January 11 along with Anupam Kher’s The Accidental Prime Minister. While the latter lost its hold on the box office, the Aditya Dhar directorial continues to attract viewers. It is expected to earn more as there is no big release scheduled for this weekend.
Before celebrating the success of their film, Vicky Kaushal, Yami Gautam, Aditya Dhar and Ronnie Screwvala met defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the occasion of Army Day on Tuesday. Sitharaman took to Twitter to congratulate the film’s team.
Uri is based on 2016 Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads across Linc of Control as a retaliation for the Uri attack that claimed the lives of 17 army personnel."

A day after the Uri terror attack in Kashmir which left 18 soldiers dead, Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), said the Army has the desired capability to respond to acts of aggression and violence from Pakistan.
“We reserve the right to respond to any act of the adversary at a time and place of our choosing,” Lt General Singh said in a statement which suggests that the Indian response to Pakistan will not be knee-jerk.

The statement followed an hour-long meeting Monday afternoon in the Ministry of Defence between Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Army chief General Dalbir Singh and the DGMO. Sources said the meeting carried out a review of the situation in Uri, including the latest analysis about the likely routes of infiltration of the four terrorists who were killed Sunday morning.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who Sunday promised that the Uri attack will not go unpunished, held a meeting with his senior Cabinet colleagues, Doval and the Army chief to discuss the strategy ahead as the Centre weighed its options.
In the evening, the Prime Minister also met President Pranab Mukherjee, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, who Sunday said that “India will not be cowed down” and “will thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their backers”.
Parrikar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley attended the meeting chaired by the Prime Minister in which the the top security brass briefed the Prime Minister on the prevailing ground situation in Kashmir. Meanwhile, a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), led by an IG-rank officer, reached Uri to gather leads. NIA chief Sharad Kumar is likely to visit the attack site Tuesday.

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the entire world has realised that Pakistan is a nation which sponsors terrorism and gives shelter to terrorists. He said Pakistan has been using terrorism as a state policy against India. “But the Narendra Modi government assures the people of the country that in the battle of peace versus terrorism, terror and its masters will be destroyed,” he said.
Describing the Uri attack as an “act of cowardice”, Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu accused Pakistan of “aiding, funding and training terrorists” and called it a “rogue” nation. “It has become their state policy. It is a rogue nation as they are not abiding by the promise they made,” he said, adding that “Pakistan is exposed at the international level and all the countries in the world should come together to condemn the heinous act of Pakistan”.
Naidu said it is time to declare Pakistan as a terrorist nation and urged the world to come together to stop assistance to Pakistan. “The UN should take up this issue in a serious manner because terrorism is an enemy of humanity; it’s not against India alone, terrorist activities are happening in different parts of the globe. Pakistan has become an epicentre of terrorism. It is high time that UN should come forward to declare Pakistan a terrorist state,” he said, asserting that India will give a fitting reply to the Uri attack perpetrators."

We had a similar trade fair exclusively for Pakistan traders in Chandigarh in February earlier this year after the Pathankot terror attack. We had no problem in that.”
“The visa is usually provided to them two or three days before the start of the event,” he said."

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray on Saturday took exception to Bollywood star Salman Khan’s defence of Pakistani artistes and claimed that the actor should take a Pakistani permit to work in that country.
“If he feels so much for these actors, then he should take a Pakistani permit and work there,” Thackeray said while addressing a press conference in Mumbai.
Salman on Friday had said that actors aren’t terrorists, after the Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association passed a unanimous resolution at its annual general meeting, to “henceforth, not to work with any artistes, singers or technicians from Pakistan”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“They may not be terrorists but how do you know that they are not informers who are passing information from here to there,” Thackeray added.

He asked why these artistes were being hired when there was an abundance of local talent.
Thackeray also claimed that those who hired these actors should be blamed. “More than the actors, these producers and directors are to be blamed. I think they will not understand unless we stop watching their films,” he added.
Soon after the Uri attack, the MNS had given an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave India within the next 48 hours or risk being beaten up. Many of the Pakistani artistes had left India after the attacks.
However, Salman’s statement created a fresh set of problems for the MNS as the actor and his family are known to be close to Raj Thackeray. While many believed that the MNS would go soft on Salman, the party chose to hit out at the actor."

(Source: PTI)
Describing the Uri terror strike a transit destination in the “war” forced on India by Pakistan, BJP President Amit Shah today said the attack was an outcome of frustration after security forces foiled 17 infiltration attempts and that the final victory will belong to India.
Echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that those responsible for the terror strike will surely be punished, Shah said the country is committed to giving a strong reply to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.
In his inaugural address at the party’s National Council, Shah said the party feels the widespread anger in the country as he hit out at Pakistan and supported the Modi government’s diplomatic efforts to corner the neighbour. He later made a separate statement on the raging issue with the Prime Minister and entire top brass of the party present on the dais.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“BJP feels the widespread anger in the people against the conspirators behind the Uri terror attack. BJP and the central government have adopted the policy of zero tolerance against terrorism from the beginning. A strong reply to defeat such terror attempts will be given. 117 terrorists, which is the highest in recent times, have been killed in the last 8 months as the Centre started its strategic and strong fight against terrorism.
“Terrorists have made 17 attempts to infiltrate across the border in the last eight months but our brave soldiers have foiled them. The Uri attack has been carried out due to this frustration. This is a long war which has been forced on us by our neighbour. Uri is only its transit destination and not the final outcome. The final victory will be ours,” he said.
“The country is committed to giving a strong reply to this Pakistan-sponsored terrorism,” he said asserting that it is no less than a war crime if terrorism becomes part of a government’s policy.
His remarks came after Modi tore into Pakistan over the incident, saying India will not forget it but indicated that his government’s focus will be on isolating Pakistan diplomatically.
The party fully supports the government’s diplomatic efforts to expose Pakistan, he said, adding that it has succeeded in showing the country’s true face to the world. Shah noted that Modi has assured the people that those behind the incident will be punished. “However long is the battle, we will fight it and the victory will be ours.”
He appealed to the people and other political parties to support the Centre and the Army in this battle.
The world is shocked at Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s reference to Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a “peace-loving youth”and it is an evidence of that country’s involvement in terrorism, he said.
India has long been a victim of Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism and faced several small and big terror attacks in the last many years.
“Pakistan has become a centre of global terrorism,” he said."

Two co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have strongly condemned the Uri terror attack and said they will work within the US Congress to put pressure on Pakistan to end any association with terror groups targetting India.
Republican John Cornyn and Democrat Mark Warner of the Senate India Caucus, the only country-specific caucus in the US Senate, said in their letter on Thursday that they are greatly concerned about initial indications that the perpetrators of the September 18 Uri attack “were Pakistani and that the attack emanated from Pakistan”.

“If true, this attack would be just the latest in a series of deadly attacks in India conducted by Pakistan-based terrorist groups.”
They called on Pakistan to cooperate fully and transparently in the probe and prosecute those “within its territory that participated in this horrendous attack”.
“Pakistan’s possible involvement in this attack underscores our broader concern about Pakistan’s use of terrorism as a pillar of its foreign policies toward Afghanistan and India.”
“As many credible experts have noted, such groups as the Haqqani network, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad still operate freely in Pakistan, launching attacks not only on India but also on US personnel and interests in Afghanistan.”
They said it is “unacceptable” that such terror groups still operate within Pakistan.

“That such terrorist groups continue to operate within Pakistan is unacceptable, and we will work within Congress to pressure Pakistan to end any association with these terrorist groups targeting India, put a stop to their cross-border incursions, and take active and immediate steps to rein in homegrown terrorists,” they wrote.
They said the continued threat of terrorism that both India and the US face highlights the critical need to continue expansion of US-India bilateral defence, intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation.
They welcomed the declaration of India as a major defence partner, and the inking of the Defence Framework Agreement and deepening of the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative.
“Similarly, we are pleased by the finalisation of an arrangement to facilitate the sharing of terrorist screening information and the progress made by the US-India Counter-terrorism Joint Working Group and the Homeland Security Dialogue. We will continue to support these and other initiatives that will increase US partnership with India against terrorism,” they said.
The Senators conveyed their deep condolences to the families of the soldiers killed in the attack. “Please know that the Senate Caucus stands with you, and that we will not allow terrorists to sway our shared commitment to fostering greater peace and promoting democracy in the region.”"

Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor’s forthcoming Ae Dil Hain Mushkil has created buzz due to his sizzling onscreen chemistry with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan but he declined to comment on speculation that the film is now in trouble as MNS said that they won’t allow its release in Maharashtra for featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.
Asked about this, Ranbir said: “I can speak about my film Ae Dil Hain Mushkil. Other than this I don’t know anything about other rumours.”

Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which is slated to release next month, will see Fawad in a supporting role while another Pakistani actress Mahira Khan plays the lead role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Raees. However after the Uri attack, Maharashtra Navnirman Chitrapat Karmachari Sena declared that they want the Pakistani actors to move out of India.

About the dance reality show, he said: “I feel humble when I am reminded of my own family legacy for being attached to this film industry for last 80 years.”

The Army on Sunday said it had enough evidence to show that the six terrorists who carried out the attack on an Army camp in Uri belonged to Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and supported by Pakistani establishment and were highly trained for special operations.

It also said that the slain militants were looking to hit civilian targets to create fear ahead of the third of the five-phase polling in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
General Officer Commanding(GoC) of Army’s 15 Corps Lt General Subrata Saha said the GPS recovered from the slain militants showed that there is a staging area north of Jhelum on the other side of Line of Contol(LoC).
“One infiltration took place in Tut Mari Gali (Nowgam Sector) and one in Uri sector. I am not revealing the exact location (of the staging area) for obvious reasons,” he told reporters.
Saha said the incidents in Nowgam sector, in which six militants and a JCO were killed, and in Uri sector on Friday were not routine infiltration attempts.

“To say it was a routine infiltration would be improper. The sequence in which the events have happened and if you see the numbers and levels of training that has gone in to preparing these people, it is not an ordinary infiltration. It is linked to the larger events that are taking place here,” he said, referring to ongoing elections and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Srinagar tomorrow.
Eleven security personnel including eight soldiers were killed in the pre-dawn attack on the Army camp on Friday in Mohra in Uri sector by militants, who had infiltrated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir(PoK), before all the six assailants were shot dead.
The army commander said that there was enough evidence to show that the assailants were supported by the Pakistani establishment and that the attack and other incidents before it along the LoC in Kashmir were coordinated and synchronised.

“We have enough evidence that both the groups were from the Lashkar-e-Toiba. The markings on the warlike and logistic stores whether it is food, ammunition, medicines or clothes, clearly indicates that they were of Pakistani manufactured and origin. The terrorists were heavily armed and they had enough food to last several days,” he said.
He said the incidents that took place during the month of November indicate that there was a coordinated attempt from across the LoC to disrupt the electoral process in Kashmir.
Gen Saha said the militants killed in the two operations this month including the Uri attack were highly trained and capable of carrying out special operations.
“There is no doubt that they were highly trained terrorists. The TMG infiltration took place in high altitude and snowy conditions. To infiltrate in these conditions, one requires high level of physical fitness. The second operation on Mohra, they crossed Jhelum by foot, which obviously requires high level of training. I would say these terrorists were capable of special operations,” he said."

Almost two years after the Uri attack that was mounted from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the retaliatory surgical strikes against terrorist pads in PoK, the US signed off on using New Delhi’s language and used “territory under Pakistan’s control”, and not Pakistan’s “territory” — to describe Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They also slammed the use of “terrorist proxies”, a description for extremist political groups used by Pakistan’s army in the region.
The Indian side also used the term “retribution” for the first time when it came to justice for those behind the Mumbai terror attack in 2008. But, the US stuck to the standard formulation of “to expeditiously bring the perpetrators to justice”, and did not mention retribution — a key theme for the Indian side after the 2016 surgical strikes.
Sources said that this “diplomatic formulation” in the joint statement Thursday — agreed at the first-ever Indo-US 2+2 bilateral dialogue — is “new” and “significant”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“This shows their acknowledgement that PoK is not Pakistan’s territory and it’s under its control. A lot of negotiations went in to get this language change in the joint statement,” a source said.

The joint statement issued after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met US Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo and US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that the Ministers denounced any use of “terrorist proxies” in the region, and in this context, called on Pakistan to ensure that the “territory under its control” is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries.
Incidentally, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Donald Trump in Washington DC in June 2017, the joint statement had said, “The leaders called on Pakistan to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries.”
While India has long maintained that Pakistan Army uses “proxies” to mount terrorist attacks in India, their visibility has increased in the recent Pakistan elections where UN-proscribed terrorist organisation Jamaat-ud-Dawa contested as a political outfit. Its founder Hafiz Saeed, who is the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack and who faces a $10 million bounty, campaigned as well.
“During negotiations with US officials, the Indian side was able to convey the urgency to name and shame these outfits which are being mainstreamed by the Pakistan’s establishment,” the source said.

Pompeo, who met Pakistan’s top civilian and military leadership on Wednesday, “briefed” the Indian side on his discussions with newly elected Pakistan PM Imran Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
He is learnt to have conveyed to Pakistan’s leadership that Washington needs to see “action on the ground”. The Indian sense was that the US Secretary of State and his delegation did not come away with much satisfaction. “There was a sense of realism (in the US side)”, a source, who was part of the 2+2 talks, said.
The Indian side also used the term “retribution” for the first time, when it came to justice for those behind the Mumbai terror attack in 2008.
In the presence of Pompeo, Swaraj said, “On the 10th anniversary of the 26/11 attacks, we recognize the importance of justice and retribution for the masterminds behind this terrorist attack.”
Mattis also recalled the Mumbai attacks and recognized that “both our nations have endured the effects of senseless terrorist attacks like those 10 years ago in Mumbai, which killed innocents from more than a dozen nations. We remember those lives lost as we approach the 10th anniversary of attacks this November.”"

Amid heightened Indo-Pak tensions in the aftermath of the Uri terror attack, Pakistani classical singer Shafqat Amanat Ali’s concert scheduled here on Friday has been cancelled.
“We decided to cancel the concert of Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali. We took this decision in the aftermath of Uri attacks,” Radio Mirchi Group Manager (Sales) Srinivas said.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The concert was scheduled for September 30, but the decision was taken on September 20 itself, Srinivas said.
“The concert was cancelled on September 20, much before the saffron parties raised the issue, demanding cancellation of the event. In fact, Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad raised the issue recently, a few days back,” he said.
The event was cancelled after considering public safety and security issues, Srinivas added.
VHP and Bajrang Dal had been demanding cancellation of the concert after the Uri attack in which as many as 18 soldiers were martyred and four terrorists were neutralised.
Bajrang Dal Karnataka unit President Suryanarayan said there was no need of inviting the Pakistan singer.
“Everyone knows what Pakistan is. Everyday it is killing many (Indian) soldiers. The world is on the verge of declaring Pakistan as a terrorist state. Such being the case, what is the necessity for inviting a Pakistani singer here,” he said.
The Bajrang Dal, hence, has lodged a police complaint demanding cancellation of the event, and also warned police and Radio Mirchi that they would be responsible for any untoward incidents, Suryanarayan said.
“Bajrang Dal strongly opposes any such event, and lodged a police complaint as we have decided to work within the constitutional framework,” he said.
Days after the Uri attack, Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navanirman Sena had issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Pakistani artistes and actors including Fawad Khan and Ali Zafar, to leave India by September 25 or else they would be “pushed out”."

Watch what else is making news

As host of this year’s BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Summit, India, as is the practice, can invite neighbouring countries to join in for an outreach summit. Following last month’s cross-border terror attack on an Indian Army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 19 Indian soldiers, India chose to invite countries belonging to the Bimstec grouping over those of Saarc.
Countries belonging to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) are India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka. New Delhi blamed Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed for the Uri attack and launched a diplomatic blitz to isolate Islamabad in the international community.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The invitation to Bimstec countries instead of the Saarc countries is being seen as another step in this direction. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Maldives are the members of the South Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) that are also not members of Bimstec. Following the Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also pulled out of this year’s Saarc Summit that was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November citing Pakistan’s state sponsorship of terrorism as the reason.
Afghanistan and Bangladesh too followed suit citing the same reason while Sri Lanka held that a Saarc summit was not possible in India’s absence. The BRICS-Bimstec Outreach Summit will be held here later on Sunday."

Addressing the two-day National Executive meet of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the national capital on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government is committed to changing the quality of the life of poor people and the move to demonetise higher value currency was a part of the long term measures against corruption and black money in the country. “Our commitment is to change quality of life of poor. Demonetisation part of long term measures against corruption, black money,” he said.

He further commented on the social evil of corruption and how it was an impediment in the development of the country. “Corruption a big social evil and unregulated flow of currency a big stumbling block in containing graft,” he said. PM Modi also asked the party members to use their ‘organisational strength’ to win the poor over as that was true service to God. “Serving people amounts to serving God,” he said.

Members at the meet gave a standing ovation to PM Modi for the “unprecedented” cross-border surgical strikes and the demonetisation “success”. Party President Amit Shah also praised the prime minister on Friday for India’s stance after the Uri attack. Shah said, “Because of the leadership and will power of the Prime Minister, for the first time in independent India, we gave a fitting reply by entering the enemy’s own home… this one decision changed the way the world looks at India.”

The national executive also praised the armed forces and came down heavily on Pakistan. “Terrorism is today seen by the democratic and civilised world as a scourge whereas Pakistan continues to use it as state policy.

The surgical strikes ordered by the Prime Minister and total rejection of the separatist agenda by the people and governments of J&K and the Centre are a categorical assertion to Pakistan that its ulterior designs shall never succeed and the government led by PM Modi will continue to demonstrate zero tolerance for terrorism; and it reserves every right to respond to such threats in an appropriate and out-of-the-box manner in future also,” read the resolution adopted by the BJP national executive.

China on Saturday defended its second technical hold to prevent a UN ban on Pakistan-based JeM chief Masood Azhar saying there were “different views” on India’s application and that Beijing’s move will allow more time for the “relevant parties” to have consultations.
Reacting to India’s criticism that its second hold on attempts to ban Azhar sends a dangerous message, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the listing application member states submitted to the 1267 Committee of UN “must comply” with specific requirements of relevant resolutions of UN Security Council (UNSC).

Though China is the lone member among the 15-member UNSC to oppose the ban on Azhar, Beijing claims that “different views” existed about India’s application against Azhar.
“There are still different views on India’s listing application made this March. The technical hold on it will allow more time for the Committee to deliberate on the matter and for relevant parties to have further consultations,” the ministry said in a written reply to PTI to a question seeking its response to India’s strong criticism.
The reference to “further consultations” apparently referred to direct consultations between India and Pakistan over the issue. China had put the first technical hold six months ago on India’s application following Azhar’s alleged involvement in the Pathankot terrorist attack.
China had extended the second technical hold valid for three months during this week despite several consultations between New Delhi and Beijing at various levels. It is expected to figure again during the expected meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit to be held in Goa from October 15-16.
While opposing the ban against Azhar, the Chinese Foreign Ministry however said “China firmly supports combating all forms of terrorism, stronger international cooperation against terrorism, and supports the central and coordinating role of the UN in international counter-terrorism cooperation”.
It said, China always maintains that on the listing matter, the 1267 Committee should stick to the principles of objectivity, impartiality and professionalism, base its judgments on solid evidence and decide upon consensus among the members of the Security Council.
Without naming China, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said on October 6 that only one country had put the technical hold, blocking the ban by another three months, and criticised the completely “non-transparent and anonymous” manner of designating individuals by the UN Sanctions Committee.
India has been highlighting the cross-border terror threat emanating from Pakistan and tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad are on the rise since last month’s Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir which killed 19 Indian soldiers."

This year has given us a lot to be concerned about, and the passing away cult pop singer George Michael and Star Wars actor Carrie Fisher in just the past couple of days, preceded by the death of Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa on December 5, and other global stalwarts such as David Bowie, Fidel Castro, Prince, Muhammad Ali, among many others have left us mourning.
Add to this the growing intolerance that has swept the social media space (in recent weeks, the illogical and ridiculous hate messages for Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan’s newborn Taimur or the moral policing of cricketer Mohammad Shami and his wife just because she wasn’t wearing a hijab), then there were the atrocious attacks in Istanbul and Berlin, the heartbreaking images and ‘last calls’ from refugees in Syria — yes, 2016 has been quite hard on us.
But it wasn’t all bad. A scan across stories in the social media space itself throws up some positive instances that not only restore our faith in love and humanity, but also give us a reason to smile and look forward. Be a UP girl from a poor family graduating from IIT, a Nepalese grandfather who started going to school or a real-life love story that found completion after decades, 2016 has also inspired us in ways we wouldn’t have thought possible.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Take a look at some of the most positive stories of 2016.
1)  Sushma Swaraj can easily be called the queen of Twitter India for 2016

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj made sure she helped people who reached out to her on Twitter. Through the year, she has not only rescued Indians from conflict zones but also helped a man unite with his wife for their honeymoon after she lost her password a few days before flying. The times she has helped people includes safe departure of Pakistani girls from India amid the tension between India and Pakistan after Uri attacks, making sure the a Jodhpur man tied the knot with his fiance from Karachi and a son reaches home in time for his father’s funeral. Not even a surgery deterred the politician from doing her job. She is undeniably the queen of Twitter India for 2016.

In a veiled reference to Pakistan, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh Saturday said a neighbouring country is trying to destabilise India by encouraging “cowardly” act of terrorism but our government will never let the nation to bow down its head before anyone. “A neighbouring country of our again and again encourages terrorism and terrorist activities to harm India. Perhaps it was not able to understand the fact that terrorism is not a weapon of the brave but of cowards,” Singh said at the concluding ceremony of Chhattisgarh Rajyotsav – the 16th foundation day celebrations at Naya Raipur.

Further referring to surgical strike by Army after the Uri attack, he said, “You have seen how they cowardly attacked our jawans but after that our jawans did a wonderful job. I want to assure that this government will never let India to bow its head before anyone”.
Singh also said unable to stomach India’s rapid growth, some countries are trying to destabilise the nation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Today, India is progressing rapidly. It is the country which has highest economic growth rate in the world presently. Some countries (anti-India) are jealous of us and trying to destabilise (the country). They are trying to weaken India. But I assure you that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi no power could weaken India,” he said.
Singh further re-affirmed his commitment to extend every possible support to Chhattisgarh in its fight against Naxalism.
“Development is taking place rapidly in Chhattisgarh but the Maoist activities has been a matter of concern for all of us.
“The ruling BJP government in the state has accepted the challenge and it will definitely achieve success (in combat against Naxalism). Centre will provide all kind of support to the state in tackling the menace,” he said.
Maoists never wanted roads to be built in the remote villages, good education for children, better communication system, good jobs for youth, the Minister said.
“I have already said to Maoist to stop their activities for some time and then government will show them what is development and how it takes place.”
“China was a huge supporter of Maoism but now there is no place for it (Maoism) in its their future. But here (in India) there are attempts going on to encourage Maoism,” Singh said while warning Naxals, “You must leave it (Maoism) or you will have to”.
The Minister said India is poised to emerge as a global economic power and the efforts initiated by the Narendra Modi government will start bearing positive results in the days to come.
He, however said Centre not only wanted to make India a global economic power but also a ‘Vishaw Guru’ (world-teacher).
Singh praised Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh for carrying out development oriented works in the state.
Meanwhile, 18 people and two organisations were also felicitated with state awards on the occasion for their contribution in different fields.
Raman Singh and his Cabinet colleagues were present for the concluding ceremony."

Strongly condemning the terrorist attack on an army camp in North Kashmir’s Uri town that killed 17 soldiers, top American lawmakers across the aisle have called for bringing the perpetrators of the crime to justice.
“I condemn the horrible terror attack against an Indian Army Base in Uri in the state of Jammu & Kashmir, which resulted in the death of 17 Indian soldiers. The terrorists who perpetrated this cowardly act must be brought to justice,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus on Monday.
“I extend condolences to the family and friends of the soldiers who lost their lives in the attack,” Warner said. Republican Senator Tom Cotton said the pre-dawn attack on Indian troops while they slept was a cowardly act, one that deserves the strongest condemnation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I extend my condolences to the Indian government and to the families of the fallen,” he said. “The US and India share a vital interest in defending our democracies from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Both our nations must commit fully to deepening our security partnership so that radical jihadists are defeated and stability in the region is maintained,” Cotton said.
“I strongly condemn yesterday’s terrorist attack in NW India. We will not let these attacks affect our united fight against terrorism,” said Congressman Pete Sessions, Chairman of the House Committee on Rules. The Uri attack is a reminder to democracies the world over that terrorism seeks to destroy peace loving societies everywhere, said Republican Congressman Ted Poe.
“It is still unclear which terrorist group carried out this cowardly attack, but one thing is certain. This is just the latest consequence of Pakistan’s longstanding irresponsible policy of supporting and providing operational space for all stripes of jihadi terrorist groups,” he said. Pakistan’s reckless behaviour in this regard is a serious security risk to its neighbors and India unfortunately pays the price all too often, he said. Poe is Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non Proliferation and Trade.
“We condemn this tragic attack, as well as Pakistan’s support for many criminals like the ones who carried it out, and stand firm in our commitment to our friends in India. A threat to democracy in India is a threat to democracy everywhere. And that’s just the way it is,” Poe said. The Uri terrorist attack is yet another reminder of the threat international terrorism poses, said Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.
“I strongly encourage the governments in the region to make every effort to find the terrorists that carried out these attacks and bring them to justice. The US should continue to assist these governments and ensure they can eliminate terrorist threats,” Sherman said. In one of the deadliest attacks on the Army in recent years, 17 soldiers were killed and 19 others injured as heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the force in North Kashmir’s Uri town early Sunday. Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed by the Army."

The editorial in Organiser, ‘Facilitating the failing state’, comments on the Uri attack. It notes that while this was “not the first terrorist attack from across the border”, it has “received unprecedented attention in recent times, almost similar to that of terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament”.
The Uri attack “is a response to growing isolation and resultant frustration within Pakistan”. “When Bharat is spreading its diplomatic dynamism all over the world at the bilateral and multilateral level, the credibility of Pakistan is diminishing day by day,” it says. “The US has cut-down the credit line” to its “trusted ally”, as “Bangladesh and Afghanistan are openly talking about Pakistan as a terror-sponsoring state”. As the Pakistani state is crumbling due to various internal reasons, its best option “to divert attention is to aggravate anti-Bharat sentiments”. “Unfortunately for Pakistan, the situation is so grave that this tested strategy may boomerang this time,” it says. As the Modi government came to power with high expectations on the security front, “people are obviously expecting much stronger action against Pakistan”. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said, “PM Narendra Modi’s promise to punish those behind the Uri terror attack would not remain words.” “There are all chances of some punitive action against the terrorist groups operating on the neighbouring soil,” it notes.
Strategic provincehttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An article in Organiser notes the “distinctive and important status” of Balochistan “due to its economic, political and strategic as well as geographical position”. Balochistan has a vast area encompassing Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan province and a significant portion of Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces in southern Afghanistan and the large chunk that has been under Pakistani occupation since 1948. “Currently, Pakistan-occupied Baluchistan is nearly 44 per cent of total area of Pakistan,” while it has just about five per cent of its population. Its “geopolitical situation provides it the leverage, not only regionally, but also globally”. “Baluchistan holds approximately 75 per cent of total 1045 km coastline of Pakistan,” it says, pointing out that “the most important port of Baluchistan is Gwadar”.
This southern terminus of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is being developed by Pakistan and China. Balochistan is also rich in mineral and natural resources. “Today it is the largest gas producing area of Pakistan,” it says, adding that “it has estimated reserves of 2 trillion cubic feet of gas”. “If Baluchistan acquires Independence, it will become the greatest hazard to Pakistan,” it says. “By this, on one hand, Pakistan’s geographical contiguity with Iran will be terminated and on another, almost half of Afghanistan border will be lost.” It will have broad political, strategic and economic consequences for Pakistan.
Cow literature
An article in Panchjanya takes note of some recent books in Hindi that “reminds us of bonds with the cow”. One such book, Pranam Kapila, is dedicated to Kapila (cow). This book has 145 poems by 134 poets — all focusing on the cow. “This is perhaps the first such attempt,” it notes. The writer has explained the aim behind its publication and included those scriptures that consider cow slaughter a sin. He has also mentioned several programmes being undertaken in Muslim countries for cow welfare.
“There is a farm, Al Shafia, 100 km south-east of Saudi Arab’s capital, Riyadh,” it says, noting that this farm has 36,000 cows, of whom 5,000 are of Indian breeds. “A special section consumes milk of Indian cows,” it says, pointing out that “the royal family in Riyadh is supplied around 400 litres of milk from Indian cows”. “Writers have also played an important role in protecting cows,” it says, cites instance of a Hindi poet Narhari who, during Akbar’s reign, once saved a cow from a butcher. “Subsequently, Akbar had put an end to cow slaughter,” it says. Once, the Hindi novelist Premchand also saved his cow from a British collector in Gorakhpur. The collector had raised his gun at the cow, but Premchand came in between, forcing him to withdraw."

TILL late Sunday evening, there was no official word on the names of the 17 soldiers who had died in the Uri attack or the nature of injuries suffered by around 20 others. But one family here had begun grieving.
The family of Havildar Ravi Pal of 10 Dogra said they had been told by his cousin Joginder Pal that he had received a call that Ravi was among the dead. The family said two of Ravi’s colleagues had approached his wife Geeta Devi, 35, in Pathankot on Sunday and accompanied her and their two children to Ravi’s home in Saarba village in Jammu.
Ravi was among the few soldiers of 10 Dogra still to leave Uri, waiting to hand over to the incoming 6 Bihar. Family members said he was expected to leave Uri on Monday or Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The family had been looking forward to the transfer as Ravi was to move to Pathankot, a peace posting. Pathankot could have been his last posting before retirement next year. Some of the other members of Ravi’s regiment had already moved to Pathankot, followed by their families.

India’s Permanent Mission at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has accused Pakistan of openly supporting cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and allowing United Nations-designated terrorists like Hafiz Saeed to operate with state support.
“In gross violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1267, UN-designated terrorists like Hafiz Mohammed Saeed are freely operating with state support and UN-designated entities are being politically mainstreamed in Pakistan,” said Second Secretary of India’s Permanent Mission, Mini Devi Kumam at the 37th session of UNHRC)
Describing ‘Pakistan as a failed state’, she added, “We await credible action by the Government of Pakistan to bring all those involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack and the 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks to justice.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“They (UN-designated terrorists) are raising funds in flagrant violation of Pakistan’s international obligations,” Kumam said.
“Even as terrorists thrive in Pakistan and roam its streets with impunity, we have heard it (Pakistan) lecture about the protection of human rights in India. The world does not need lessons on democracy and human rights from a country whose own situation is charitably described as a failed state,” Kumam said further.
India also used the occasion to expose Pakistan’s poor rights record viz-a vis minorities, including Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, as also its abysmal record on forced conversions and marriages.
India also highlighted enforced disappearances and unlawful killing of political dissidents by the Pakistani security forces. “We urge the Council to call on Pakistan to stop targeting political dissidents and legitimate criticism in Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and to stop torture, enforced disappearances and unlawful killing, including that of journalists and activists by its security agencies. Pakistan should also prosecute all perpetrators of such crimes,” Kumam said.

Pakistan cannot take India’s policy of strategic restraint for granted for too long and if Islamabad rejects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s offer of cooperation, it will become part of a case for making the country a “pariah nation”, a US daily has claimed.
WATCH VIDEO:

“Modi is practicing restraint for now, but Islamabad can’t rely on that continuing. Modi’s offer of cooperation, if rejected, will become part of a case for making Pakistan even more of a pariah nation than it already is,” The Wall Street Journal said in an opinion piece on Tuesday.
“If the (Pakistani) military continues to send arms and fighters across the border, the Indian Prime Minister will have a strong justification to take action,” it warned. The Wall Street Journal said India has always enjoyed the moral high ground on the terrorism issue, but past Congress and BJP governments lacked the courage to assert it forthrightly.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
That led to a policy of “strategic restraint”, which meant that Pakistan would never be held accountable for its terrorist proxies, no matter how heinous their attacks, it noted. Praising Modi for deciding against taking any military action, the daily said even as he walked back threats of military action, he replaced them with a pledge to isolate Pakistan internationally if the military doesn’t stop supporting terrorist groups. He is considering the cancellation of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, which protects Pakistan’s rights to the Indus River’s water.
He could also withdraw most-favoured-nation trading status, granted in 1996, that Pakistan has never reciprocated, the daily said. In an op-ed published in Foreign Affairs, Sameer Lalwani, Deputy Director of the Stimson Center’s South Asia program, said in the wake of the Uri attack, the understandable anger and frustration of Indian policymakers and strategies is building momentum for major military action. “But the arguments for such action are highly debatable, if not incorrect. A major militarised response might satisfy a desire for revenge, but it is not clear that it would serve the Indian government’s political, credibility, prestige, or coercive interests,” Lalwani said."

(Source: PTI photo)
Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to Goa, his second to India in a month, has generated more curiosity in Nepal about what he is likely to tell Chinese President Xi Jinping. The curiosity is not without reason. Every party except the Nepali Congress has accused Dahal of “sell-out” to India, especially over the 25-point joint statement the two prime ministers issued during his four-day visit to New Delhi in September. Even the Maoists, his own comrades, did not spare him. Among other things, the statement spoke about forging a common position on regional and international affairs in world bodies, and Nepal’s commitment to support India’s bid for a permanent seat in the UN  security council.
WATCH VIDEO: ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’


This is not the first time such commitments have been made by Nepal. However, the context of the statement has triggered controversy and criticism at home. Just before Dahal’s Delhi trip, clear indications had come from the Chinese side that the much-anticipated visit of President Xi would not take place either on his way to or return from the BRICS meet in Goa. President Xi’s trips to Bangladesh and Mongolia were to have taken place along with that to Nepal. There was no change to Xi’s Bangladesh and Mongolia plans whereas he is unlikely to visit Kathmandu this year. There is speculation that China wants to send a message to Nepal.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At least for the record, Dahal said Xi’s visit would figure prominently when the two meet on the sidelines of the BRICS summit. The Chinese had been wanting a firm commitment from Kathmandu that all the agreements and understandings reached during K.P. Oli’s tenure as prime minister would be honoured. This implies an assurance from Nepal that it would give equal importance to both its giant neighbours.
However, Dahal’s Delhi visit in less than a month after he took over and his joint statement with Modi came as clear indicators that Nepal can’t afford to hastily depart from its traditional proximity to India, despite the blockade and Oli getting close to China in rebound. Moreover, India is also perceived as a major factor in ensuring Nepal’s political stability. Dahal, perhaps, wants his remaining tenure of six months — coalition leader and Nepali Congress chairman Sher Bahadur Deuba takes over in May — to be trouble-free.
Dahal’s success in diplomacy will be judged by his ability to bring President Xi to Nepal at the earliest,” Madhu Raman Acharya, a former foreign secretary said. “Nepal could provide a crucial link for China with South Asia,” he added. But China will expect a clear word on the fate of past agreements on enhanced trade, access to sea ports and Chinese railway services being extended to Nepal. In addition, the Chinese side is also believed to have promised necessary “assistance” to the Nepal army for its modernisation.
Will Dahal be able to promise these to China on Indian soil? A failure could cost him his credibility before the Chinese whereas Indians may not take kindly if he does. In Delhi, Dahal had assured Modi that he would bring all the political parties on board and amend the constitution to address the demands of the Madhesis that include more autonomy to provinces, a review of the current demarcation and more rights to naturalised citizens. But the promised date for moving the amendment is already over and a prominent Madhesi leader, Upendra Yadav, has declared that Dahal’s days as prime minister are “numbered”. The Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, headed by Oli, and seven other parties whose support is crucial for the amendment being carried, have said they will oppose such a move.
India’s diplomatic offensive since the Uri attack has led to the isolation of Pakistan and the cancellation of the SAARC summit in Islamabad. Back in Nepal, the current chair of SAARC, the government is being criticised for not doing enough to save the regional forum. High-placed sources say China is keen to assess Nepal’s perception regarding the future of SAARC.
The coming days are crucial for Dahal. His foreign trips and the commitments he will make there will evoke a reaction at home. The delay in bringing about the promised constitutional amendment to address the demands of the Madhesis and his inability to secure a firm date for President Xi’s Nepal visit will be seen as failures. The vulnerability of Dahal will accentuate the political instability in Nepal and have a demoralising impact on the economy, public safety, and lead to a credibility crisis in the  neighbourhood."

India’s efforts to hold Pakistan accountable for the attack on a camp near the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri escalated on Tuesday with Islamabad’s envoy to New Delhi, Abdul Basit, being summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs to be presented with evidence that the attack originated from territory under Pakistan’s control.
The National Investigation Agency earlier announced the arrest of two men it says “facilitated” last week’s strike which claimed the lives of 18 soldiers.

Yasin Khursheed, said to be a resident of Khiliana Kalan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Muzaffarabad, and Faisal Hussain Awan, a resident of Potha Jahangir, disclosed during interrogation that they were ordered to “facilitate infiltration of a group of four Jaish-e-Muhammad cadre who carried out the Uri army camp attack”, the Ministry of External Affairs said.
Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar offered High Commissioner Basit consular access to the arrested individuals during their meeting — their second since the Uri attacks. Earlier, the Foreign Secretary had informed Basit about the recovery of items with Pakistani markings from the terrorists, including food and clothing, as well as a Global Position System set.
In a statement, the NIA said Awan identified one of the four slain terrorists who attacked the 12 Brigade headquarters as Hafiz Ahmad, who he said was the son of Feroze, in the village of Dharbang, west of Murree. “Further interrogation of the two men is being done”, the NIA said.
Few other details were released on the two men but sources said they are suspected of having brought up to five groups of Jaish-e-Muhammad jihadists across the Line of Control starting in February, 2015, allegedly receiving between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 for helping infiltrating groups evade military patrols and ambushes.
Sources familiar with Khursheed’s interrogation said he is believed to have been recruited by an individual so far identified by the single name Basharat, who ran a school where the 19-year-old studied until he discontinued his education in Grade 7.
Sources said they were now in possession of a Global Positioning System set recovered from the site of the terror attack, and were seeking assistance from technical experts to see if data could be recovered from it to track the route taken by the terrorists. External Affairs Ministry and NIA officials also said in separate statements that the two men were “apprehended by villagers due to their suspicious movement in Uri sector and handed over to the security forces”.
Local residents corroborated this account, telling The Indian Express the men had initially denied wrongdoing, saying they had inadvertently crossed the LoC from a village called Kaliana Khurd — across the LoC from Kashmir’s Kupwara. Following a beating by villagers, local residents said, the men claimed to be Jaish-e-Muhammad cadre.
However, a PTI report dated September 21 quoted Army sources as saying that the “two men were apprehended in a joint operation by the Army and BSF close to the LoC ”. The PTI report added that “one of arrested men is believed to have acted as a guide for the four.
Later, the suspects gave investigators varying accounts, one to a doctor working for the Central Reserve Police Force that they had participated in the attack itself, providing details of how incendiary substances were used to set the tents at the 12 Brigade on fire.
It was unclear if the arrest of the two men was linked to surveillance targeting jihadist groups in the Uri region, which had led the Intelligence Bureau to issue an warning on September 15, warning of imminent strikes on an “army establishment”. The Jammu and Kashmir Police, sources said, had also issued a warning on August 25, stating that a strike by a joint Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish unit on Uri’s helipad was being planned.
Basit, the External Affairs Ministry said, was also confronted with the unrelated arrest of a third Pakistani national, named as Sialkot resident Abdul Qayoom. Qayoom, the Ministry of External Affairs said, had confessed to “undergoing three weeks of training with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba and donating substantial funds to Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, their front organisation”."

Asserting that it wishes to have good neighbourly relations with Pakistan, the government today said it remained in touch with it through bilateral diplomatic channels, including addressing all urgent humanitarian needs even after cancellation of Foreign Secretary-level talks as agreed in December 2015.
In a written reply to Lok Sabha, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the talks envisaged between Indo-Pak foreign secretaries to decide the modalities of the Composite Bilateral Dialogue, agreed during her visit to Islamabad in December 2015, could not take place due to the terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase in January 2016 and other attacks last year emanating from Pakistan.
She also noted that the government’s diplomatic efforts in the wake of Pathankot and Uri attacks led to widespread recognition internationally that Pakistan’s policy to sponsor and support terrorism against its neighbours posed the biggest challenge to peace and stability in the region and beyond.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The government was also able to effectively neutralise Pakistan’s efforts to internationalise Kashmir issue, and conveyed to India’s interlocutors that normalisation of India-Pakistan relations through a peaceful bilateral dialogue can take place only in a conducive environment free from violence and terrorism,” Swaraj said.
She, however, added that during this period, “the governments of India and Pakistan remained in touch through bilateral diplomatic channels, including for addressing all urgent humanitarian and other matters concerning people-to-people ties.”"

Asserting that those behind the attack on the Army base in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir will face the consequences, Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said India will intensify diplomatic efforts to isolate Pakistan internationally. Holding Pakistan responsible for the attack, in which 17 armymen were killed and 19 injured, he said “since independence, Pakistan has not accepted Jammu and Kashmir as an integral part of India and this is the reason that terror attacks happen in the country with its support.”
Jaitley described the terror strike as “a highly condemnable act of cowardice” and a “major challenge” for the forces.
“The perpetrators of the Uri terror attack will face consequences. Diplomatic efforts to isolate Pakistan internationally will be intensified,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In a series of tweets on microblogging site, the Finance Minister said, “Perpetrators of Uri terror attack shall be punished. My thoughts & prayers are with families of our soldiers injured & martyred.”
“Uri terror attack is a highly condemnable act of cowardice. Salute to our soldiers who gave supreme sacrifice to protect the motherland.” he said in a tweet.
Earlier, he had said that security forces will have to work on their strategy to deal with ‘fidayeen attacks’ by terrorists which have emerged as a “major challenge”.
“These are challenges to our security,” the Finance Minister had said, condemning the terrorist attack on a camp at Army’s Brigade Headquarters in Uri town.
“.. Pathankot and Uri (terror attacks) appear to indicate that these (fidayeen attacks) have restarted again. And I think this is a major challenge which I am sure our security forces will gear up to respond,” Jaitley told reporters.
He said that in recent years there had been an increasing reliance “on activities like stone throwing agitations” which were instigated from across the border.
Heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours today, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the strike in which four ultras were neutralised.

In January, seven military personnel were killed when six terrorists attacked the Pathankot air base."

WITH THE government initiating the process of isolating Pakistan internationally in the wake of the Uri terror strike, senior BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said on Tuesday that the offensive will not be only through diplomatic response.
“It’s not just diplomatic response alone, it will be handled in an appropriate manner and no kind of blackmail is going to be tolerated. Nobody wants a nuclear war in the region and nobody will succumb to nuclear blackmailing also,” said Madhav.
 

On the day of the attack on Sunday, Madhav had issued a strong statement saying “for one tooth, the complete jaw,” and that “the days of so-called strategic restraint are over.”
The party had declined to comment on these remarks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Today, Madhav was referring to the reported remark by Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja M Asif that his country would not hesitate in using tactical weapons if Pakistan’s security is threatened. “It only shows the rogue nature of the people and of the country to talk about the nuclear weapons etc,” said Madhav, who was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the India Foundation.
The BJP general secretary also indicated that the government would mount pressure on Pakistan at different levels. “ We all know the terrorist attack in Uri has seriously disturbed the people in the country. They want a strong and appropriate response from the government. It is very well appreciated by the government and the Prime Minister himself has said that the culprits shall not be spared.”
He said the government has already started certain actions at the diplomatic level to isolate Pakistan and to expose its “dubious character”. He said: “As far as other measures are concerned the government and concerned agencies have made it clear that at appropriate time, all the necessary responses will be given.”
Meanwhile, senior BJP ministers met party chief Amit Shah on Tuesday evening. Sources said External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj briefed Shah on India’s stand on Kashmir and Pakistan at the UNGA. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar explained the post-Uri attack developments at the meeting held at the residence of Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar.
Sources said the ministers and Shah also discussed the dates for the winter and budget sessions. Senior ministers Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari were also present at the meeting.
In a related development, BJP MP and former Union Home Secretary R K Singh said on Tuesday that India should “hit back in similar fashion”. “We need to hit back… The other side has to be clear that if they hit you, you will hit back; if they break a finger, you will break two… The reaction has to be not only proportionate but dissuasive as well,” he said."

The phrases, “surgical strikes” and”hot pursuit” have become part of popular discourse in India since the time the Indian military carried out the counter-terror operation on the other side of the Line of Control. In the aftermath of the attack on the army camp in Uri, people’s anger was simmering against the audacity of the terror exporters. It wasn’t the first time that they had launched such an attack. On 26 November, 2008, Mumbai, and indeed the nation, was shaken by one of the biggest terror operations on the country’ soil. However, the approach of the then UPA government in dealing with the perpetrators of the act was in marked difference to that taken by the current NDA government.
After 26/11, dossier after dossier was sent to Pakistan, which responded with denial and evasion. Post the Uri attack, however, the NDA government’s response was different. It did not send dossiers but allowed its army to cross the LoC and take down the camps that were funding and facilitating terror against India. The foresight shown by the government in backing the army in conducting a carefully-calculated retribution is nothing less than commendable.
The counter-terror operation was not an ill-thought out exercise. It was a calibrated move, keeping in consideration the capabilities of the Indian forces. On the night of September 29, 2016, Indian commandos crossed the LoC covering a distance of 3 km to launch a pre-emptive strike on a terror camp preparing the mujahideen for infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of the country to conduct terror operations. Forty-five terrorists, including their guides and handlers, and nine Pakistani army men were gunned down. No casualties were reported on the Indian side.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The next day, India declared to the world that it had conducted such a strike. It sent out a clear message that India will no longer sit and tolerate terror on its soil. The country is capable of answering the enemy in its own language and will not succumb to international pressure of any kind. The entire episode displayed a paradigm shift in the way the country counters terrorism. For the first time, a fine balance was struck between political leadership, military capabilities and strategic competence of the two establishments. A well-plotted strategy executed to the tee, without any casualties, took down enemy camps and brought enough evidence to show those in denial (read Pakistan).
It was also the first time that India backed the army through and through and articulated its stand firmly to the world. In earlier instances, we would hold ourselves back owing to the ramifications any such act would have internationally. However, after the surgical strikes, when the government unequivocally supported the army action, many countries endorsed India’s move.
The pro-activeness in taking down infiltrators on their home-ground had a huge impact on demoralising the forces planning India’s destruction. A new red line vis-à-vis terrorism has been drawn by India. Anyone crossing it would have to pay a heavy price. The result of such a firm political stand on terrorism is reflected in the actions of the army. With the government at the Centre championing the “Nation First” approach, it has much more confidence and freedom to do what it does best. In the past four years, the number of civilian casualties due to terror attacks, outside of a conflict zone, has been zero. Dreaded terror groups like the Islamic State and al Qaeda have failed in their persistent attempts to target India and the country’s interests, under the Narendra Modi government. Compare this with an earlier era, when news of terrorist attacks had become the normal.
Surely, launching surgical strikes is not a one-off measure. A number of steps have been taken to structurally enhance India’s defence capabilities and preparedness. The Defence Procurement Policy brought out in 2016 provides for a vision to turn India from an arms importer to an exporter. A huge emphasis has been laid on new initiatives such as Make in India which call for greater indigenisation and relaxed FDI norms in the defence sector to encourage investment in defence production.
The government has also entered into a number of agreements with different countries for the modernisation of defence equipment and weapons. This includes the $8.7 billion deal for 36 Rafale aircrafts, a $2 billion deal for advanced surface-to-air missile systems from Israel as well as a $100-million contract with an Indian firm for supplying 1.86 lakh bulletproof jackets to the army.
The government has also shown its sincerity with its commitment to the welfare of soldiers and ex-service men who dedicated their lives to the service of the nation. The nation is forever indebted to its soldier. The same sentiment can be seen in the unflinching support of the government to the Indian forces. The soldier standing at the borders, is buoyed by the free mandate given to him. He is energised and emboldened as he takes on the threats to the soil on the battlefield."

(Source: Twitter)
“When two neighbours fight, both homes are affected.”
Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has asked both India and Pakistan to maintain peace and say no to war as tensions between the two countries continue to rise after the recent surgical strikes by the Indian Army along the LoC. Afridi opined his views on Twitter and said that Pakistan is a peace loving country and “wants cordial relations with everyone.” He also added that there is no need to take extreme measures when things can be resolved using dialogues.
The Indian Army conducted surgical strikes on Thursday night along the Line of Control in Pakistan and targeted seven terror launch pads across border using heliborne and ground forces. Addressing a press conference, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said India inflicted “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them. Several Indian leaders, across party lines have since hailed the Army for successfully executing surgical strikes and backed the Modi government’s decision as a befitting retaliation to Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The surgical strikes are in response to the Uri attack. On September 18, four men executed what was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the Indian Army and killed 19 army jawans in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri in the rear office of an Indian Army infantry installation. The attackers are believed to have come from Pakistan. Since then, India has upped its diplomatic offensive against Pakistan in a bid to isolate the country internationally.

Posters have appeared in Gujranwala town announcing that the Lashkar-e-Taiba will be holding last rites in absentia for one of the four terrorists who attacked the Indian Army’s 12 Brigade at Uri, killing 20 soldiers and sparking off the worst India-Pakistan crisis in years. The posters are the first hard evidence for Indian allegations that the attacks were carried out by a Pakistan-based jihadist group — until now been denied by Islamabad.

The posters name one perpetrator as Gujranwala resident Muhammad Anas, who operated under the alias Abu Siraqa. They invite local residents to join namaaz prayers for the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s “lion-hearted holy warrior Abu Siraqa Muhammad Anas, who sent 177 Hindu soldiers to hell at the Uri Brigade camp in occupied Kashmir, and thus drank from the glass of martyrdom”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Bearing images of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the head of the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s parent organisation, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the posters say the ghaybana namaaz janaza, or last rites held in the absence of the body of the deceased, will be held at Bada Nullah, near Girjakh, in the Punjab town of Gujranwala.
Though Indian officials had blamed the Jaish-e-Muhammad for the Uri attack in the days after the strike, The Indian Express had first reported that investigators believed the unit involved belonged to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, based on the codes the assault team had used to speak with their commanders. It was not clear if similar functions had been, or would be, held elsewhere in Pakistan for the other terrorists killed in the Uri attacks. Few reports on activities involving jihadist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba appear in Pakistan’s press, particularly when they occur outside major cities.
National Investigations Agency detectives had struggled to identify the perpetrators of the assault, or produce evidence of the group that carried out the attack, until posters appeared in Gujranwala. Two German-manufactured eTrex global positioning sets had been recovered from the attackers, but one was too badly damaged by fire for data to be retrieved. A second is still being studied by forensic experts.
Though syringes, painkillers, other medications and packets of ready-to-eat food carried by the terrorists bore the markings of several Pakistani manufacturers, linking the perpetrators to that country, these offered no evidence on the identity or affiliations of the terrorists themselves.

Government sources said two men arrested on charges of helping facilitate the infiltration of the group—Ahsan Khursheed and Faisal Awan—continued to provide contradictory testimony, showing little knowledge of the specifics of the attack.
“It is possible they were transborder traffickers,” a source familiar with the investigation said, “but that they were not familiar with this particular operation”.
Lashkar teams have staged a series of increasingly bold attacks on Indian military units over the past year, notably one on soldiers of 24 Punjab Regiment and 31 Field Regiment near Uri last year, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers and three police personnel. In that case, global positioning set data showed the team had originated in the town of Chham, across the Line of Control, but the perpetrators remain unidentified.

Indian intelligence services and the Jammu and Kashmir Police have, however, arrested Pakistani nationals alleged to be tasked with staging similar attacks, including Muhammad Naveed and Bahadur Ali.
The Jaish-e-Muhammad, for its part, has focussed on operations outside of Jammu and Kashmir, notably the attacks on Pathankot and Gurdaspur. The organisations, intelligence sources said, had brought prestige to the organisations on Pakistan’s religious right.
Earlier this year, The Indian Express revealed video footage showing the organisation, ostensibly banned by Pakistan, collecting funds for jihad outside mosques in Karachi as police stood by watching."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first engagement after being sworn-in for a second term was a meeting with visiting Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov in Rashtrapati Bhavan at 10.15 pm Thursday — soon after the swearing-in ceremony and the State Banquet.
On Friday, Modi will start his second term in office with a series of bilateral meetings with the visiting leaders of countries from BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), who had been invited for the swearing-in ceremony.

The first meeting is with Bangladesh President Mohammed Abdul Hamid at 10.30 am in Hyderabad House. It will be followed by meetings with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and Bhutan Prime Minister Dr Lotay Tshering.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Officials said these meetings have been allotted about 20 minutes each, but could be extended.
By inviting leaders from BIMSTEC countries, Kyrgyz Republic and Mauritius to his swearing-in ceremony, sources said, Modi has made a carefully calibrated move that signals a major outreach to India’s neighbourhood from the Bay of Bengal to Central Asia, as well as the Indian diaspora.

In 2014, Modi had invited SAARC leaders, and the then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s attendance had raised hopes of a new beginning in bilateral ties. This time, SAARC’s exclusion appears to be aimed at keeping Pakistan out of New Delhi’s engagement with its neighbours.
By meeting Jeenbekov, India is displaying an outreach to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which is headed by the Kyrgyz leader, and has China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan as members.

India, which became a member of the SCO along with Pakistan in 2017, wants to leverage its membership to advance its strategic objectives — counter-terrorism and connectivity. Modi is likely to attend the SCO summit in Bishkek on June 13-14.
Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, who was also the chief guest at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas this January, is seen as one of the most well-placed People of Indian Origin in the world. Since Modi has invested diplomatic capital in his outreach to the Indian diaspora since 2014, this invite is seen as “a natural choice”.
Explained | Why Modi swearing-in invite to BIMSTEC leaders sends important signals to India’s neighbours
The key message, however, is the outreach to BIMSTEC, which includes Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan, besides India. The BIMSTEC had held its fourth summit in Kathmandu in September 2018.
New Delhi’s engagement with BIMSTEC rose from the ashes of SAARC. In October 2016, following the Uri attack, India gave a renewed push for the grouping that had existed for almost two decades but been largely ignored. Alongside the BRICS summit in Goa, Modi hosted an outreach summit with BIMSTEC leaders.
That September, some of these BIMSTEC countries had supported New Delhi’s call for a boycott of the SAARC summit scheduled in Islamabad in November 2016. As the summit was postponed, India had claimed victory in isolating Pakistan, which it had accused of carrying out the Uri attack.
BIMSTEC subsequently emerged as a regional platform where five SAARC countries could gather and discuss sub-regional cooperation. India had long felt that the vast potential of SAARC was being underutilised and opportunities lost due to either “a lack of response or an obstructionist approach from Pakistan”.
The search for an alternative had been evident at the 2014 SAARC summit in Kathmandu, where Modi had said opportunities must be realised “through SAARC or outside it” and “among us all or some of us.” That was seen as an important signal to Pakistan, as well as to fellow SAARC members."

The film stars Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor.
Amidst the controversy around the release of Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, the director is keeping the buzz afresh with small updates every now and then. After releasing the fourth song from the film, Karan has released the first dialogue promo from the film. The dialogue promo has Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor sharing the screen space and their chemistry as best friends Alizeh and Ayan is just impeccable. But what steals the show is the dialogue itself. Anushka takes over the screen to explain the meaning of a boyfriend, which, according to her, is like films. In the promo, she says, “Boyfriends filmo ki tarah hote hai, kuch time-pass aur kuch blockbuster.”
Karan shared this promo on Twitter on his official handle. Along with the video link, the director wrote, “And the Diwali 🎉 celebrations begin…the FIRST dialogue set piece is here!! #ADHMThisDiwali http://bit.ly/ADHMdialogue1 #aedil”.
While institutions like Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India and MNS are trying to stall the release of the film, Karan has not stopped from promoting it. The film is scheduled to hit the screens on Diwali, October 28.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil faced a backlash after MNS demanded a ban on all the movies starring Pakistani artistes and threatened them to leave India. COEAI had announced that they would not screen movies starring Pakistani artistes in the four states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa. The decision taken by the COEAI mainly covers single-screen theatres and comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack last month."

DEDICATING THIS Dussehra to India’s surgical strikes against terrorist launch pads in Pakistan after the Uri attack, the Sanatan Dharam Dussehra Committee is all set to burn a 85-foot-tall Ravana effigy — the tallest in the Tricity — at the Sector 46 ground on Tuesday. “In the beginning, we will be paying homage to all our jawans who died in Uri attack. Dussehra is the victory of good over evil. So this time our theme is India’s victory of carrying out surgical strikes after the Uri attack,” said Jatender Bhatia, chief patron of Sanatan Dharam Dussehra Committee.
The committee has arranged four drones to shower flowers on the guests from above. Not just this, the committee has also tied up with TV channels and arranged TV sets at few markets where people can see the burning of the effigies. “All the three effigies (the other two being Kumbhkaran and Meghnad) have been prepared by artist Jameel Ahmed from Saharanpur. For elderly people who cannot come to the venue, we have arranged telecast of the event through certain channels,” added Bhatia.Chandigarh NewsTika Utsav concludes, Punjab fails to hit its daily target even onceSukhbir promises Dalit deputy CM if voted to power, BJP the CM post3,329 fresh cases, 63 more deaths in PunjabClick here for more

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Monday said Pakistan should stop dreaming about Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. She was addressing the 71st UN General Assembly in New York. “My firm advice to Pakistan is: abandon this dream. Jammu & Kashmir is an integral part of India and will always remain so,” Swaraj told the Assembly. Responding to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s comments at the UNGA a few days back, she said India had attempted a paradigm of friendship without any precedent.

“Did we impose any pre-condition before extending an invitation for the oath-taking ceremony of our government? Did we impose any pre-condition when I went to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia conference and agreed to begin the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue? Did we impose any pre-condition when Prime Minister Modi travelled from Kabul to Lahore?” She said India took the initiative to resolve issues “not on the basis of conditions, but on the basis of friendship.”

“We conveyed Eid greetings. Wished his cricket team good luck. What did we get in return? Pathankot, Uri. I want to ask: are we putting conditions or are you going in opposite direction..”
Swaraj said India, which has just suffered the Uri attack can understand the pain of 9/11 for which the world marked the 15th anniversary this month. “These malevolent forces are yet to be confronted. Terrorism is the biggest violation of human rights. It targets the innocent and kills everyone indiscriminately,” she said, questioning how it is important to ask who is behind this as terrorists don’t own banks.

“Who provides the financial backing to them, who funds them…history proves that those who promote extremist ideologies reap no benefits,” she said, adding that it only threatens the peace and harmony of the world. “It is impossible to make distinctions between your problem and mine. We need to join to script an effective strategy against terror. It is not impossible provided we have the will.”"

Thursday’s suicide attack by Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammad marks an unprecedented escalation in its efforts to take the centrestage of militancy in the Kashmir Valley. This year alone, it has been responsible for as many as a dozen attacks in the Valley, two in Srinagar on the eve of Republic Day.

The return of the Taliban to the political table in Afghanistan — its talks with the US and Pakistan were announced Wednesday — and China’s repeated stalling of efforts by India and the US to blacklist Azhar have boosted Jaish’s three-year-long campaign to revive itself in Jammu and Kashmir after a protracted lull.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
LIVE UPDATES: At least 37 CRPF men killed in Pulwama attack
To that effect, Azhar even sent his two nephews to the Valley: Talha Rashid, who was killed in October 2017, and Usman Haider, who was killed a year later.

Jaish’s first major strike that pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war was the 2001 Parliament attack. In January 2016, it was behind the attack on the Pathankot airbase in which seven security personnel were killed. And the September 2016 Uri attack in which 20 soldiers were killed. New Delhi subsequently responded with a surgical strike across the LoC.

Car bombing is not new to Jaish. In the spring of 2000, 17-year-old schoolboy Afaq Ahmad drove an explosive-laden Maruti into the headquarters of the Army’s 15 Corps in Srinagar. The car exploded at the gate as the boy panicked. This announced the entry of Jaish, then newly formed by Maulana Masood Azhar who was released in 1999 by the then Vajpayee government in exchange of the crew and passengers of the hijacked IC-814 plane at Kandahar.
After the schoolboy, Jaish sent a 24-year-old British citizen in an explosive-laden Maruti car right up to the entrance of the Army’s 15 Corps headquarters on Christmas Day. In 2005, a Jaish woman suicide bomber blew herself up in Awantipora.

The Pak-based Jaish — Azhar is based in Bahawalpur — has its umbilical cord linked to the Taliban. Soon after 9/11, when Islamabad sided with the US, Jaish took it on. In fact, the Jaish suicide attack on the J&K Assembly in Srinagar soon after 9/11 that killed 23 was the first attack in Kashmir to be officially condemned by Pakistan.

Jaish’s problems with the Pak establishment were exacerbated after its two assassination bids on then President Pervez Musharaf in 2003.

Around this time, Jaish was losing ground in the Valley for two key reasons: it lost support from Pakistan and intelligence agencies here had infiltrated its ranks. In early 2004, for example, virtually the entire top brass of Jaish in Kashmir was killed at a meeting in Lolab. With the help of moles, police aborted Jaish’s efforts — Sajad Aghani, Jaish Kashmir chief, was killed in March 2011.

A local militant commander who played a crucial role in its revival was Noor Muhammad Tantray alias Noor Trali who was killed on December 25, 2017 in Pulwama.
Trali was replaced by Pak national Mufti Waqas. On December 31, 2017 two suicide bombers struck at the CRPF training camp killing five security personnel. Both were local recruits: a Class X student and son of a policeman from Tral and a taxi driver from Pulawama. In March 2018, Waqas was killed in Awantipora.
At the same Lethpora, and with CRPF its target again, Jaish struck on Thursday. With the US announcing its decision to scale back its presence in Afghanistan and the frozen nature of the India-Pakistan relationship, Jaish once again hopes to push both countries to the brink."

India has blamed Sunday’s deadly attack on the 12th brigade headquarters at Uri in Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 17 Indian soldiers, on the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).
Indeed, in the manner of its execution, the attack bears some resemblance to the attack on the Pathankot Air Base in January, for which India provided evidence of Jaish’s hand, and Pakistan even took the JeM leader Masood Azhar into “protective custody”. The number of fidayeen was four as in Pathankot, they scaled an ill-guarded wall and the first thing they did was to start a fire — just as they had done at Pathankot.
Provoking the Modi government to hit back with a military response is perhaps the larger goal behind the attack, with the more immediate objective of attracting international attention to Kashmir. Indeed, sections of the Indian security establishment clearly want military retaliation, even a limited strike, maybe imagining that this will be as surgical and clean as the two hot pursuits by the Indian Army’s special forces across the Myanmar border. Last year, they chased down Naga militants of the Khaplang group of NSCN in retaliation of the ambush and killings of 18 soldiers in Manipur, eliciting some criticism in Myanmar. Another hot pursuit took place last month, and this time there were no complaints. Pakistan is different, but right now, those asking for revenge are not particularly concerned about that.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Nothing gives the international community a bigger fright than the prospect of war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in South Asia, and even without any response from New Delhi, there is bound to be greater world attention on India and Pakistan in the coming days, perhaps even a global push for restarting diplomatic initiatives between the two sides.
Meaanwhile, Jaish has achieved at least one tactical objective: it may not speak for all of Pakistan, and it may deny its involvement in the attack, but in Kashmir, where the group’s origins are well known, the attack has served to signal that the Pakistani state is no mere bystander to events in Kashmir during the last two months.
For the same reason, in Pakistan, it gives Army chief General Raheel Sharif a shot in the arm. The Pakistan Army may or may not be behind the Jaish attack, but its long, if somewhat troubled association with a group that it parented is well known. The attack is bound to reinforce the view that the Pakistan Army is the better guardian of the interests of the Kashmiri people than Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Modi’s warnings that the perpetrators of the attack will be punished is bound to rally the public behind their army even strengthening that institution, just as it did in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks.

As India mourns the loss of 17 soldiers, both Kashmir and Pakistan see Sunday’s attack as a response for the two months of trauma, the 76 deaths, the hundreds maimed by the use of pellet guns and the thousands injured in security operations.
For more than two months, Nawaz Sharif’s government had been asked again and again by his critics and security and foreign policy hawks — what are you doing about developments in Kashmir? Noticeably weaker after the Panama papers expose of his family’s offshore accounts, Sharif’s response has been to up his rhetoric on Kashmir, first by declaring Burhan Wani a martyr of the Kashmiri freedom movement, then by dedicating Pakistan’s independence day to Kashmir and describing the protests in Kashmir as “a new wave of the freedom movement”.
Next, he is to pitch Kashmir at the United Nations General Assembly later this month. Pakistan is waiting to see if that will bring the Kashmir issue the international traction it has failed to get in the last two months. It is also a huge test for the Pakistani PM himself. But in a way that is reminiscent of Kargil, Jaish-e-Mohammed appears to have stolen a march on Nawaz Sharif with this attack. The Mumbai attack had been described as then President Asif Ali Zardari’s Kargil moment. This attack may well go down as Nawaz Sahrif’s second Kargil.
For India, despite the threats of punishment and “jaw for a tooth” rhetoric emanating from Delhi, the choices before the Modi government are neither open nor easy.
If Modi does not respond in some aggressive way, his image as a strong leader is at risk. He would also be blamed for not signaling, through “effective response”, India’s zero-tolerance for adventurism of this sort from Pakistani territory.
Those who advocate a military retaliation must remember that he would play into the hands of the perpetrators with an outcome far from certain. India still has diplomatic channels with Pakistan. Diplomacy moves at glacial pace, and the results with a country like Pakistan are bound to be as uncertain as a military retaliation but still represent a better strategy.
Difficult days are ahead for Prime Minister Modi, and for India."

Prime Minister will fly to Kerala, where he will address party office-bearers in Kozhikode and is expected to break his silence on the government’s response to the terror attack on the Army base. Immediately after the Uri attack, the Prime Minister had vowed in a strongly worded tweet that he will not let the perpetrators go “unpunished.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Earlier, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had asserted that the Prime Minister’s promise to punish those behind the Uri terror attack would not remain just words.
Last Sunday, a militant attack on an army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, has claimed the lives of eighteen soldiers. While 17 soldiers died on Sunday, the army confirmed that one more critically injured soldier succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, pushing the death toll to 18
The armed militants lobbed grenades into their tents and barracks, while the soldiers were sleeping. The ensuing fire led to a large number of casualties. Twenty-eight injured soldiers are being treated at a military hospital."

Watching the jets hover over north Kashmir, border residents felt apprehensive as they were reminded of the heavy artillery exchange between India and Pakistan more than a decade ago.
Following the ceasefire agreement of 2003, there was peace along the Line of Control, apart from the occasional skirmishes at forward posts. Villagers in Uri — who bore the brunt of heavy cross-border shelling — also reaped the dividends of peace. Now, after the Uri attack and increasing Indo-Pak hostilities, the villagers are preparing for the worst.
“I remember the days when shells used to land in civilian areas. Many lost their lives, including people I knew. After the ceasefire, we have been living a peaceful life,” said Mohammed Aijaz Khan, who runs a hotel in the main market. “Now we are worried about cross-border shelling again.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Khan said his family was lucky as their underground bunker was still intact. “If shelling starts, the people of Uri will suffer the most. Unlike our neighbours, who have no underground shelters, we are lucky as we can save ourselves,” he said.
In the late 1990s, when shelling was at its peak, many villages, especially those along the LoC, had constructed underground shelters with government assistance. Most of the bunkers were damaged in the 2005 earthquake, and remained in disrepair due to the ceasefire.
“After the Uri attack we are thinking of getting the shelters repaired,” said Engineer Mukhtar Ahmad, who lives in Garkot, within shelling range of the Pakistan army. Ahmad said that many villagers were thinking of making new underground bunkers. “In the absence of bunkers, we have to move to a safer location,” he added.
At the remote Trikanjan village, 25 km before Uri town, locals voiced similar concerns. “We have seen the worst shelling. In the late 1990s, dozens of families migrated from our area. Now every villager is concerned,” said Hilal Ahmad, who teaches in a private school.
Most of the villages on the LoC are within the range of artillery firing from Pakistan. The Indian Army also has artillery positions at various places from Boniyar up to forward areas."

(representational image)
The fidayeens from across the border seem to have taken a sudden liking for defence establishments in the Jammu and Kashmir. It now seems these attackers have attached a symbolism to their attacks by way of striking at Army strongholds as a show of strength.
In the light of the ongoing unrest in Kashmir, it seems non-state actors are intent on inflaming the security situation in a state that remains on the edge. It also derails and undermines any attempts by the Army or the Indian government to make peace with the protesters.
The upsurge of fidayeen attacks has been witnessed since March 2013. A similar trend of frequent fidayeen attacks on the defence establishment and troops was last seen during 1999-2002 when militancy was at its peak in the state. During 2001 alone, there were 25 attacks on government and security forces installations with total disregard for the lives of civilians.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Live updates | High-level security meet at HM Rajnath Singh’s residence ends
But the new trend targets seems to be aimed specifically at armed forces installations, often not even near the LoC as was the case before. Fidayeen attacks have been a strong weapon in the hands of terrorists to destabilise Kashmir and keep it in a state of political flux to fuel their separatist agendas.
In terms of troops casualties, the Uri attack is worse than the Pathankot airbase attack when six attackers and seven security forces personnel were killed. Seventeen armed forces personnel were martyred killed in the attack which is the maximum for any fidayeen attack till date. The attack on Sunday was carried out at the rear office of an infantry battalion of the 12th Brigade Headquarters in Uri, Baramulla. The installation is surrounded by the Line of Control on three sides and at one side the distance is only around 6 km.

The government’s preparations for ward off such attacks come into question after every hit. Though, the fidayeen squad that attacked Uri appeared to be well drilled and attacked the installations at places with the minimum security cover. According to various reports, the rear office of the infantry battalion, is the one side that doesn’t face the LoC. As military protocol suggests, the maximum security cover must be deployed on the vulnerable directions—in this case the sides towards LoC from where maximum attacks are expected.

After the Pathankot attack rocked the country, the government had initiated a security audit of all the defence establishments in Jammu and Kashmir by a multi-agency committee under the chairmanship of former Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt General Philip Campose. The committee recommended periodic reviews in view of dynamic changes seen in security situations on the ground along with hiring of new dedicated Garuda commandos for securing these establishments.
Also, repeated terror attacks on Indian defence and security establishments since September 2013 initiated from Pakistan along with frequent discoveries of trans-border tunnels necessitate a strong stance against these non-state actors. The government must take a firm stand on neutralising such terrorists to secure the security situation in Kashmir."

According to sources, the BSF has asked for a flag meeting with their Pakistani counterparts over this issue. “No response from them yet,” said sources.

Even as the stones thrown from the Pakistan side landed in the Indian territory and a section of Pakistani spectators raised anti-India and pro-Kashmir slogans, the ceremony carried out by border guards of both the countries continued.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BSF had on Thursday suspended the ceremony following escalation in tensions between both nuclear neighbours after the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) to destroy terror launch pads.
 
The retreat ceremony is carried out by border guards of India and Pakistan, the BSF and Pakistan Rangers, at the Attari-Wagah JCP at sunset every evening. The 30-minute ceremony is watched by hundreds of people from both countries daily.
The relation between the two countries soured after the Uri attack as India is making all effort to isolate Pakistan."

Remaining in the denial mode, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday termed as “India’s long-time habit” the assertion that his country was behind the Uri attack. He told Pakistani journalists here that India blamed Pakistan for the attack on army camp in Uri within a few hours of the incident and claimed that questions are being raised on New Delhi’s “haste”.

“Investigation into such incidents requires many days and weeks,” Sharif was quoted as saying by the Geo TV.

He also claimed that India had never provided any evidence to prove its accusations.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His claim comes a day after Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit was summoned to the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi. He was told that India has evidence showing involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the Uri attack and demanded that Islamabad refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism directed against this country.
Sharif said that instead of hurling accusations on Pakistan, India should stop its “atrocities”, claiming that it is involved in “serious human rights violations” in Kashmir. “108 people have been martyred in Kashmir over the past two-and-a-half months and India is hurling allegations at Pakistan,” the Prime Minister said. According to the Pakistani media, Sharif said he had

informed the leadership of the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and some other countries about the prevailing “grave human rights situation” in Kashmir and “they all tried to understand Pakistan’s position”.
He said Turkey promised to send a fact-finding mission to Kashmir and a similar response was given by the Organisation of Islamic Countries."

(Express photo by Javed Raja)
Union Home Minister Amit Shah Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to abrogate Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir will open doors of development in the region. Shah was addressing the 7th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) at Gandhinagar as the chief guest Thursday.
Under Modi’s leadership, the country has not hesitated in taking decisive steps against terrorism, he added.
“For many years, India did not take decisive steps against terrorism. But, when the Uri attack happened, we conducted surgical strikes. We gave a message that though we fully believe in peace, no one can play with our security. Similarly, we retaliated with airstrike after the Pulwama attack and conveyed that no one can play with our boundaries,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Abrogation of Article 370 was seen as a big challenge which no one was ready to talk about. But Narendra Modi did it in one go. Kashmir was deprived of development. People of Kashmir were suffering from unemployment and poverty. But now, I am confident that under Modi’s leadership, new industries will come and tourism will also flourish, which would create employment opportunities.
The Union Home Minister further said that when the Narendra Modi government took charge in its first term in May 2014, the economy of the country was in a shambles, but things have improved over the last five years.
“Today India is the fastest growing economy in the world. The fiscal deficit that was about to cross 5 per cent, today it is 3.3 per cent. IMF too has assured that India will be the fastest growing economy for the year 2019 and 2020. In ease of doing business, we were ranked 142 in 2014. This year, we have ranked 77th which is a very big achievement. GST was on of the the biggest sales tax reforms. Mukesh bhai (Ambani) had told me when it (GST) was implemented that though it is good for us but politically we might face loss. At that time too I had told him which I repeat today that Narendra Modi does not take decision to appease people but which are good for them.”
Shah also urged the students to rise above the narrow confines of self and family, and work for the nation, and said that this would present them with endless possibilities for growth.
In his address, PDPU president and industrialist Mukesh Ambani praised Shah and termed him as the “Iron man of our age”.
“Amitbhai, you are a true karmayogi. You are the Iron Man of our age. Your energy and focus always amazes me. Gujarat, and now India, are blessed to have an inspiring leader like you,” said Ambani."

Speaking at an event, Musharraf said that to counter failures, the army has to take action. “Democracy is an ineffective system for Pakistan as there are no checks and balances in the system, and to counter such failures, the army has to act because people of Pakistan expected too much good from the military, ”the Express Tribune quoted Musharraf, as saying .

When asked about the future of democracy in Pakistan, Musharraf said, “So, therefore, we have to maybe tailor the political structure in accordance with the dictates of Pakistan, introduce checks and balances so that misgovernance does not take place and the army does not have to come into politics.”
He said that since independence, the army has always played an important role in Pakistan. “It has played a very prominent role in the governance of Pakistan, mainly because of misgovernance by all the so-called democratically-elected governments,” he further said.
Speaking in reference to the recent Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir, he said he would have counter-threatened India. The former president also said that the United States has used Pakistan for its own interests.
Musharraf said he was still doubtful of Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden’s continuous presence in Abbottabad town and the episode of 2011 raid. He insisted that government and intelligence agencies were not sheltering Bin Laden at the compound."

The terrorist attack on an army base in Uri was the tipping point for the strained relationship between India and Pakistan. The country’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly didn’t help in mending fences, when he called Hizbul commander Burhan Wani a “young leader”. India then gave a befitting reply as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the neighbours should forget about Kashmir because it’s an integral part of India and will remain so. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said that the Uri attack will not go unpunished.

On Thursday, the Indian army announced that it carried “surgical strikes” across the Line of Control which resulted in “significant casualties”. In retaliation, the Pakistani army claimed that only two of its soldiers died in “border skirmishes”. However, it became clear that one of our soldiers was captured by the Pakistani army and the government is doing everything possible to release him from captivity. The situation is tense on both sides of the border at the moment. In this charged atmosphere, social media users from both sides of the border are virtually at war.
But there are a few who call for peace and love instead of war. Islamabad-based girl Alizay Jaffer penned down a moving post on India-Pakistan relations that has garnered massive support on social media.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“To the world, most of the time, we are siblings; constantly at loggerheads, trying to get into daddy’s good books so that he may buy us a toy, or take us for a drive, or better yet, increase our allowance. Other times, we are like a divorced couple, sharing space, constantly bickering over who lost out in the settlement, unable to finally come to terms with the fact that we are no longer together. It seems the scars of our separation are still so ripe, so painful, that they can’t accept that we left, and we can’t accept that they let us leave. In an event like this, we only find solace in making sure the other is just as hurt as we are, so we put in our all our resources, our best efforts, to do exactly that,” she wrote.

I find myself getting increasingly upset at the abuse and hatred tossed from one border to another, with little rationale apart from the 69 year old chips on our shoulders. These chips have, over time, turned into boulders, and who doesn’t crumble under the weight of those?
It’s very strange, this affinity with India. When Amitabh Bachchan is in the hospital, we pray for his good health; when Ranbir Kapoor’s film is a hit, we’re prouder than Neetu and Rishi; we never deny that no one brings romance to life like the voices of Kishore and Rafi; they are in unanimous agreement that their local music scene is not a patch on ours; if we happen to interact abroad, they’re the only pardesis we include in the ‘desi’ category; their monuments carry our history; our language carries their roots.
It’s far too strange, this affinity with India. Like siblings, we retaliate to each other’s provocations. Ultimately, we both share the label of being impulsive and emotional in our responses to one another – ‘Look at what you’re doing in Kashmir’ ‘Hah, look at what you’re doing in Balochistan’; ‘You attacked us first in Uri’ ‘Have you forgotten about Kargil’?; ‘You started it!’ ‘No! You started it!’

Like orphaned trust fund babies, we feel entitled yet have no idea how to cope. They neither acknowledge nor respond to Muslims being massacred for eating beef in Gujrat, for instance, and we? We turn a blind eye to Christians and Hindus being physically assaulted for eating before Iftar in Ramzan. They’re destroying Kashmir, we say, Kashmiris have a right to be independent (or choose us, of course), but we forget how we throttled Bangladesh – why should a Bengali speaking majority not accept Urdu as its national language? We never speak about that, do we? Too soon, perhaps.
When I think about some of my best days and nights in the last ten years, more than 50% of them were spent with my brothers and sisters from across the border; sharing a meal, listening to music, discussing politics, or anything but; laughing, dancing, singing; but most importantly, completely aware yet in vehement passive rebellion against the lines that keep us apart.
Come to think of it now, it isn’t strange at all, this affinity with India. Our proverbial Lord and Master, the gargantuan power that rules us, ‘The West’, is an absentee parent; one we’re constantly trying to please but one who never really loved us anyway. If there is anyone for us, it’s each other. What’s strange is our reluctance to acknowledge this.
What’s strange is the burden we carry of decisions made in our pasts, based on an entirely different socio-political context, when a common, exploitative antagonist made sure we saw each other as the aggressor, and boy, did we fall for it. What’s strange is our prolonged blindness to the immense opportunities that lie before us as a unit, and the vast desolation that lies before us as enemies.
The strangest thing about our relationship, in fact, is our propensity to change roles. To the world, most of the time, we are siblings; constantly at loggerheads, trying to get into daddy’s good books so that he may buy us a toy, or take us for a drive, or better yet, increase our allowance. Other times, we are like a divorced couple, sharing space, constantly bickering over who lost out in the settlement, unable to finally come to terms with the fact that we are no longer together. It seems the scars of our separation are still so ripe, so painful, that they can’t accept that we left, and we can’t accept that they let us leave. In an event like this, we only find solace in making sure the other is just as hurt as we are, so we put in our all our resources, our best efforts, to do exactly that.
I read today that India claimed they carried out a surgical attack in Uri. Ridiculous. I immediately read several, equally ridiculous Pakistani reactions; some hitting below the belt, others claiming that one shouldn’t expect more from mass murdering politicians, like the ones we have across the border. Somehow, suddenly, we are all too forgiving of our own ‘glorious’ politicians. It’s strange how quick we are to forget how much trouble governance is in, on both sides, when we jump up to point fingers.
I’m sure this news will leave me in a month’s time. What hasn’t left me is the news about a Pakistani Head of State’s arrival in Delhi for a test match, ultimately averting the threat of war; or an Indian politician putting his hand forward to greet his Pakistani counterpart, to curb tensions; or that time when Ganguly acknowledged that there’s no one greater than Wasim; or when Shoaib Malik married Sania Mirza; or that image of the guards in the most beautiful fraternal embrace I have ever seen, on Holi at Wagah Border. I suppose it’s because some of us look for peace, we hanker for it, while others, they look for war.
I suppose what I’m trying to say is, in 20 years’ time, Uri will be just another event in the text books. It will be labeled as yet another period in our collective histories when our ‘cold war’ with India almost turned into ‘hot war’. It will be just another opportunity for me to pick on my Indian friends or vice versa. It will be just another event our older uncles will discuss when they try to feel better about Pakistan’s failures and convince themselves that partition was the best thing that could’ve happened for us and that, without India, ‘we’re better off’.
What will never be ‘just another event’ is one we never address. The fact that we are now divorced; the fact that our separation is painful for both of us; the fact that where there is now hate, there was once unity and a common pride; the fact that we allowed an external power to come in and manipulate us, and we fell prey; the fact that no one will know us like we know each other, because after all, we were once but one.
It is comforting somehow, that when I messaged one of my closest friends across the border, expressing concern over the destructive megalomaniac tendencies of our governments, he responded and said, ‘It doesn’t matter what they do, you know I will always love you’. It is comforting somehow, that in 20 years’ time, if you look away from the textbooks, and turn to your ancient scriptures or your holy books, it won’t take you long to see that since time immemorial, there is only one message they are trying to convey, only one message we should be paying attention to; and that message is Love.

Whatever verified facts eventually emerge about the September 29 surgical strikes across the LoC, it appears that the operation was as carefully calibrated as any use of force could be. One danger now is that media triumphalism in India could increase pressure on various actors in Pakistan to “teach India a lesson” and demonstrate their own manly resolve. If the result were a high-casualty attack in the heartland, Indian leaders would feel the need to do something more dramatic than the well-practised tit-for-tat violence across the LoC. This could fuel a harder-to-manage dynamic of actions and reactions whose end point would be difficult for anyone to predict or control with confidence.
India’s key leaders know this, of course. The prime minister has urged other officials not to beat their chests over the blows struck against jihadis and Pakistan last Thursday. The government is mobilising every intelligence and operational resource to detect and interdict potential attacks in Kashmir and the rest of India. Monday’s reported riposte of another attack, in Baramulla, reflects this. If the Pakistani military and militant groups under their control confine themselves to confronting India in Kashmir, escalation should be quite manageable.
The more worrisome possibility is that terrorists will attack “soft” civilian targets in a major Indian city, killing many more than the 19 who died at Uri. If such an attack succeeded, despite preventive measures, the pressure on Indian leaders to respond with unprecedented ferocity would be enormous. Depending on the scale of damage inflicted, the prime minister would be urged to retaliate against targets outside of Kashmir. Pressure to hit the army would be felt, whether or not reliable intelligence proved that Pakistani military leaders authorised or could have prevented such attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It can be hoped that Pakistani leaders understand these risks and will do their utmost to prevent terrorist acts that not only would cause India to counter-escalate, but also would elicit ever more international isolation of Pakistan. Yet, at least some militants have their own recruiting and brand-building interests to defy restraints that the army might seek to impose on them. If the Lashkar-e-Taiba and/or Jaish-e-Mohammed lost personnel on September 29, these groups will want to avenge them and demonstrate strength even if Pakistani leaders would prefer more calibrated reactions. Similar drives appeared to give impetus to the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai. The swirling motives and array of actors in Pakistan — and perhaps sympathetic cells of militants already in India — complicate the challenges that both Rawalpindi and New Delhi face.
For the Pakistani establishment, the primary challenges are to save face and maintain political authority at a time when Kashmiri Muslims in India are suffering and the Indian leadership is displaying muscularity. A Hindutva-inflected government with a forceful prime minister tests the mettle, purpose and self-regard of the Pakistani military (if not other segments of society). For Indian leaders, the challenge is to demonstrate the capability and resolve to “win” any escalatory competition with Pakistan, without engendering human and economic costs that undermine India’s larger national and global interests. In other words, to demonstrate that strength and will power can be blended with subtlety and deftness.
The combination of these imperatives raises extremely difficult questions for both leaderships. (Media organisations should treat these issues carefully, too. But quests for clicks, “likes”, and commercial revenue bring out the worst in us.)
For Pakistan, two central questions are: Whether the security establishment is willing and able to prevent militants from attacking targets in the Indian heartland; and, relatedly, whether the establishment is willing to share information with India that could help it interdict attacks that could not be prevented on the Pakistani side of the line. Magnanimity would not be the motive here. Self-interest would be. No one in Pakistan — or anywhere else — should be confident that the action-reaction cycle following a high-casualty terrorist attack would be “winnable” without devastating consequences.
For India, the central questions include the following. What military options exist to respond to a successful major terrorist attack in the heartland in ways that would be punishing enough to motivate Pakistani authorities to demobilise anti-Indian militant groups, and would not prompt further escalation of violence? Assuming that both objectives may not be achievable, what are the probable courses of subsequent conflict and how can India prevail with acceptable risks and costs? What political and diplomatic moves should India make toward Kashmiri groups and Pakistan — again, not out of magnanimity, but in order to place the domestic and international burden on Pakistani leaders to avert escalation?
To ask these questions is to realise how difficult it is to produce feasible and reassuring answers to them. This is the nature of violent conflict under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the cacophony of media-charged politics. History — whether from 1947, or 1965, or 2001, or 2008, or September of this year — shapes the perceptions and interests that leaders and societies must reconcile. Many moves set the stage for the Uri attack and the careful reprisal to it. None of them was the last move. The need now is to think carefully through the next ones."

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today met US Secretary of State John Kerry in New York, amidst a fresh war of words between Pakistan and India after terrorists killed 18 Indian soldiers in Kashmir. During the meeting, regional and international issues came under discussion, Radip Pakistan reported.

Prime Minister’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi and US Special Representative for Af-Pak Richard Olson were also present at the meeting.

Sharif, who is New York to attend the 71th Session of United Nations General Assembly, today called on the permanent members of the UN Security Council demanding that India should be forced to stop its alleged brutalities in Kashmir. He has said he will highlight the Kashmir issue in his address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. Heavily-armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours yesterday, killing 18 jawans and injuring 19 others in the attack in which all four terrorists were neutralised.
It was the worst attack on the Indian Army in many years. India’s DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh has said all the four killed militants were foreign terrorists and had carried with them items which had Pakistani markings and that initial reports indicated that they belonged to Pakistan-based

WITH Wing Commander Abhinandan’s return home, hopefully, the de-escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan will gather pace. The next few days and weeks will be a test for the governments of both countries — of how they keep steady as they ease back from the brink. The Narendra Modi government will need a lot of room for manoeuvre as it steers towards business as usual with a difference — it has made its point that there will be no more impunity for terror. At this delicate juncture, however, there may be at least two reasons to worry that that space could be constricted and constrained. There are two cautionary notes to be struck. One, with Pulwama and Balakot taking place almost within touching distance of a critical parliamentary election, politicians of the ruling party and in the Opposition, and especially the former, must resist the temptation to use it to draw harder lines within. And two, crucial discursive space must not be abdicated by the political leadership for studio warriors on television and in social media spaces to rush into.
On Wednesday, a meeting of 21 Opposition parties flagged the first concern. They were anguished, they said at the “blatant politicisation” of the sacrifices of the armed forces by the ruling party. The reaction of two senior BJP ministers to the Opposition’s intervention only seemed to confirm the allegation. Prakash Javadekar said that the “Opposition parties’ statement has pleased Pakistan and its media”; Arun Jaitley said “Your ill-advised statement is being used by Pakistan to bolster its case”. That the BJP leadership should seek to label its political opponents as playing into Pakistan’s hands simply because they are raising questions on its handling of a matter of national security is unacceptable. It is as unseemly as BS Yeddyurappa boasting that India’s pre-emptive strike against a terror camp in Balakot will assure the BJP of 22 seats in Karnataka in the upcoming Lok Sabha election. Or party president Amit Shah drawing a direct line between the IAF strike across the LoC, the surgical strikes after the Uri attack and the upcoming national election at a party event in Lucknow. Of course, this attempt to taint the political adversary as unpatriotic as a way of banishing democratic dissent is not a post-Pulwama phenomenon. It was seen and heard earlier during the campaign for Bihar in 2015, for instance, when Shah claimed there would be fireworks in Pakistan if the BJP lost the assembly election. Or when PM Modi himself insinuated that a conspiracy against his party was hatched over dinner by a former PM and vice president of India with senior Pakistan officials ahead of the Gujarat elections in 2017.
The war-mongering on vast sections of the electronic media is part of the noise of a vibrant and talkative democracy. It becomes a matter of concern, however, if and when it assumes the ring of authority. Post-Pulwama, it needs to be said again: TV anchors may delude themselves into thinking they are leaders but if the reverse should happen it would be a terrible thing."

In nearly a year since the Army’s Special Forces carried out “surgical strikes” on terror launch pads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), there has been an increase in the casualties suffered by the Army, the number of militants killed, and a sharp spurt in the number of ceasefire violations.
According to government data accessed by The Indian Express, 110 militants were killed by the Army between January and September last year (the surgical strikes took place on the morning of September 29, 2016).
Since the surgical strikes, 178 militants have been killed, both in the Kashmir Valley and on the LoC — 31 between October and December last year, and the rest this year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The increase in the number of militants killed is due to the ascendancy of the security forces and their high morale. There is greater acceptance of the Army across the country after the surgical strikes, and a message has gone out within the Valley that things can happen,” a government official told The Indian Express.
However, there has also been a spike in the casualties suffered by the Army in operations against militants and ceasefire violations on the LoC. Thirty-eight Army personnel were killed between January and September last year — including 19 who died in the Uri attack, which led to the surgical strikes. Since the surgical strikes, the Army toll has gone up to 69 — 25 between October and December last year, and the rest this year.
“The higher number of casualties is directly linked to two factors: more engagement with the militants, and increasing number of ceasefire violations,” said the government official.
Government data also shows that while there were 228 ceasefire violations on the LoC last year, the number till September 14 this year has already touched 444. According to government sources, over 60 per cent of the 228 ceasefire violations last year took place after the surgical strikes.
“The ceasefire violations are directly linked to infiltration bids. As Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Jammu the other day, more than 400 infiltration attempts have been made this year, much higher than last year. But we must recognise that we have also retaliated strongly on the LoC to Pakistani provocation. Also, we have been proactive, with actions on the LoC to stop Pakistan from sending militants across,” said the government official.
After the surgical strikes, 34 militants were killed on the LoC while attempting infiltration — including 27 this year. In comparison, 20 militants were killed on the LoC before the surgical strikes last year.
“The numbers are just one part of the story. You should look at the big picture. We are in ascendancy, both in the Valley and on the LoC, after the surgical strikes. That is what matters,” said the government official."

A DAY after actor Fawad Khan talked about coming together to build “a more peaceful world”, fellow Pakistani actor Mahira Khan Saturday issued a statement with a prayer for peace. Both the actors have been under criticism after the Uri attack and their detractors have been asking them to take a stand.

Meanwhile, actor Ajay Devgn has said he would not share any artistic space with Pakistani actors in the current situation. Director Farah Khan, on her part, has said she would prefer to cast “somebody from my own country”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Fawad will be seen in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, scheduled to release on October 28, while Mahira features in the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Raees, which is set to release on January 26. In her statement, Mahira said: “I strongly condemn any act of terror, any loss of human life no matter which soil it is on! I will not rejoice in bloodshed and war. I will always hope for and dream of a world where my child can live without it…”
Devgn, when asked if he will share artistic space with Pakistani artistes, said, “Not at the moment. I am very clear on this because you are an Indian first… Their artistes are standing by their nation. They are earning here but are sticking by their nation. We should learn from them.”

You need to take a stand.” Devgn’s film Shivaay is pitted against Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
Farah, meanwhile, said “There are two that we are talking about and they are not important in the scheme of things.

“Every school child in India knows Russia is India’s best friend.” That was the essence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks when he first met the Russian President Vladimir Putin at the margins of the BRICS summit two years ago in Brazil. Although Modi was on his very first diplomatic assignment outside the Subcontinent, he had got the popular Indian sense of Russia just right.
As Russia conducts its first ever military exercise with the Pakistan Army this week, Delhi has to reckon with the prospect that Russia might not necessarily remain India’s “best friend forever”. Rethinking Russia’s position in India’s strategic calculus will be heart-wrenching for many in Delhi. Moscow’s new warmth towards Pakistan may have, wittingly or unwittingly, begun to nudge India towards a relationship with Russia that is founded in realism rather than inertia.
Until now India’s Russian relationship seemed immune to change — internal and external. Governments — centrist, leftist and rightist — have come and gone in Delhi. The Soviet Union, which had such strong influence on the formation of modern India’s worldview during the inter-war period, simply disappeared from the map in 1991. But Delhi and Moscow seemed to carry on after the end of the Cod War. But by letting the sensitive Jammu and Kashmir question into its current play with Pakistan, Moscow might have dealt a big blow to the popular enthusiasm in India for the Russian relationship. At the heart of the Indian perception of Russia as the most reliable international partner was Moscow’s attitude towards the dispute between India and Pakistan over Jammu and Kashmir. The Soviet tilt towards India on the issue in the 1950s amidst the Anglo-American maneuvers in favour of Pakistan helped put a halo around Russian heads in India. During their 1955 visit to India that laid the foundations for an extended partnership between the two countries, the Soviet leaders Khrushchev and Bulganin, travelled to Srinagar. In a public reception there, Khrushchev proclaimed that Moscow was just across the border and if there is any trouble in Kashmir, Delhi should just give a shout. Moscow kept its word and exercised its veto in the UN Security Council to block Anglo-American moves on Kashmir in the 1950s.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Anyone familiar in Moscow with the special role of Kashmir in the evolution of India-Russia relations would have balked at the Pakistani proposal to conduct military exercises in Gilgit-Baltistan, that is part of the Kashmir claimed by India. It is entirely possible that the Russians did not see through the Pakistani ruse to lure them into Kashmir. Others suggest the decision may have simply been a bureaucratic mix-up. The Russian embassy in Delhi stepped in to clarify that the exercises will not take place in Gilgit-Baltistan. But the damage had been done. The timing of the exercise was bad enough. It comes at a moment when India was trying to isolate Pakistan after the Uri attacks, coping with fresh political violence inside Kashmir, and drawing international attention to India’s claims over Gilgit-Baltistan. That Russia was unwilling to postpone these exercises in deference to Indian sensitivities at this critical juncture suggests something fundamental is at work in Moscow’s approach to the Subcontinent.
That Russia has sought a normal relationship with Pakistan since the end of Cold War has not been a secret. So is the fact that Indian diplomacy often prevailed over its old friends in Moscow to limit Russian ties with Pakistan. Moscow’s reluctance to defer to Indian sensitivities this time suggests that a new phase in India-Russia relations is finally with us. Only the sentimentalists in Delhi will be surprised at Russia’s decision to redo its South Asian sums.
That a sovereign has no permanent friends is part of traditional wisdom around the world. Nothing illustrates this more than the evolution of Russia’s ties with China and Pakistan. Few countries in the non-Western world have done more damage to Russian interests. The Chinese alignment with the West from the 1970s and the Pakistani jihad against Moscow in the 1980s were central to the defeat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War. That was then; Moscow now believes it can play the China card in enhancing its leverage with the US. Some in Moscow may also bet that cosying up to Pakistan would help caution India against drawing too close to America. Others in Russia might point to the unintended consequence of pushing India into the arms of the US.
But India has no reason to be drawn into that argument within Moscow. Russia has the sovereign right to choose its friends. Nor should Delhi assume that Russia’s current orientation — warmth to China and hostility to the West — is a permanent one. At a moment of great turbulence in great power relations, Russia is rightly jockeying for position. This demands that Delhi must stop taking Moscow for granted. It must focus instead on reconstituting the partnership with a country that will remain a powerful force in Eurasia, on its own merits."

A Home Ministry-appointed committee today flagged gaps and vulnerability along the Indo-Pak border and suggested use of scientific technology and heightened vigil on riverine frontiers.
The committee, headed by former Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta, was set up following the terror attack on Pathankot air base and gave its presentation to Home Minister Rajnath Singh.

The committee flagged gaps and vulnerability in several areas along the Indo-Pak border and suggested ways to plug them, sources said.
The committee suggested that scientific methods like laser walls could not be installed in many infiltration-prone areas where due to treacherous terrain or marshy riverine fencing could not be installed so far.
The committee has given separate recommendations for four states which touch the international border with Pakistan as each state has separate topography and problems.
Though the Committee prepared the report on the basis of their assessment on the International Border from Gujarat to Jammu region, the situation is similar in Line of Control in Kashmir Valley, sources said.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, top officials of the Ministries of Home and Defence attended the meeting.
Of the 3,323 km long Indo-Pak border, 1,225 km falls in Jammu and Kashmir (including Line of Control), 553 km in Punjab, 1,037 km in Rajasthan and 508 km in Gujarat.
The committee was set up three months after the January terror attack on Pathankot to suggest ways to strengthen the security along the border with Pakistan and address the issue of gaps and vulnerability in border fencing.
It has been mandated to study all types of gaps in the fencing and all other vulnerabilities along the border and suggest a comprehensive approach to fix them on interim and and permanent basis."

(PTI)
BJP national president Amit Shah addressed a public rally in Amethi district in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. In his address, Shah questioned Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on lack of development in Amethi district. “Rahul Gandhi asks what PM Modi has done for 3 years, but people of Amethi ask him what Congress has done for 3 generations,” Shah said.
Earlier, CM Yogi Adityanath and Union Minister Smriti Irani also addressed the rally, which was called to improve the party’s tally in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The BJP leaders launched several development programmes at UPSIDC Maidaan in Amethi before their address.
The party has recognised Amethi, a Congress stronghold, with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as the current sitting MP district, as one of the seven seats which it could not win the last time in Uttar Pradesh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A day before Shah’s arrival, former Congress MLA Jang Bahadur Singh joined BJP on Monday. Speaking to reporters, Singh said he was “saddened” by the policies of the party and felt “enthused by the development-oriented politics” of the BJP.
Amit Shah Amethi visit highlights:
1:42 pm: The first thing we did was give a a Prime Minister who can speak, while Congress gave a leader who was never seen speaking at all, Shah said.
1:39 pm: PM Modi launched a surgical strike within 30 days of Uri attack. But Rahul Gandhi cannot see surgical strikes, because his glasses are Italian, Amit Shah said.
1:36 pm: The combination of Yogi plus Modi is a recipe for development, Amit Shah said.
1:33 pm: People of Gujarat the meaning of development. Rahul Gandhi, you should focus on what little you have done for Amethi, Shah said.
1:26 pm: Why there is no collector office in Amethi, Amit Shah asks Rahul Gandhi
1:23 pm: The steadfast development work started by CM Yogi Adityanath shows me that the state is going to see development soon, Amit Shah said.
1:20 pm: People of Amethi ask Rahul Gandhi what Congress has done for three generations in Amethi, Amit Shah said.
1:15 pm: Amit Shah addresses public rally in Amethi. “I have been in the public service for 30-35 years, but I have never seen the winning candidate of a constituency never visiting, but the losing candidate continuing to work for its development like a daughter,” Amit Shah said.
1:07 pm: Congress’ ‘Shahzada’ was reminded of Amethi because of Smriti Irani’s decision to call for a BJP public address in the district, CM Yogi said. BJP has always focused on the development of farmers, Yogi said.
1:05 pm: We will work towards the development in Amethi and the entire state of Uttar Pradesh.
12:55 pm: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath takes the stage at Amethi.
12:43 pm: People who are roaming around in the country talking about development, are not able to do development in their own constituency, says Smriti Irani in Amethi. If Rahul Gandhi is listening to us, then I would like to tell him, that you are talking about ‘Vikas’ in Gujarat, but at least tell the people that TV units are being placed in hospitals in Amethi under BJP rule, she said. Pipri village boycotted elections last year as their MP had no time to meet people, she added.

India on Wednesday strongly objected to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly where he glorified slain Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani. On Wednesday, the Pakistan Premier had addressed Wani as a “young leader” who was “murdered by Indian forces.” Leaders across the political spectrum have slammed Sharif for his statement.
Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup said that Sharif was “in denial of the Uri attack” adding that Sharif’s speech showed “continued Pakistan attachment to terrorism.” Countering Sharif’s claims that India posed unacceptable conditions to dialogue, Swarup said India’s only condition was to end terrorism.

First Secretary of the Indian Permanent Mission to the United Nations Eenam Gambhir used India’s right of reply to reject PM Sharif’s contentions. Here is the full text of Gambhir’s statement:
 Mr. President,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
I take the floor to exercise the right of reply in response to the long tirade of Pakistan about the situation in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The worst violation of human rights is terrorism. When practiced as an instrument of state policy it is a war crime. What my country and our other neighbours are facing today is Pakistan’s long-standing policy of sponsoring terrorism, the consequences of which have spread well beyond our region.
Mr President,
Only last week, the international community honored the memory of thousands of innocent victims from around the world, who lost their lives not far from here in New York fifteen years ago in a most horrifying terror attack. The world has not yet forgotten that the trail of that dastardly attack led all the way to Abbottabad in Pakistan. The land of Taxila, one of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, is now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts aspirants and apprentices from all over the world.
The effect of its toxic curriculum are felt across the globe. It is ironical therefore that we have seen today the preaching of human rights and ostensible support for self-determination by a country which has established itself as the global epicentre of terrorism.

Mr President,
Shortly before Pakistan gave its hypocritical sermons in this august house today, its envoy in New Delhi was summoned in the context of the most recent of the terror attacks in Uri that claimed 18 Indian lives. That terrorist attack is part of a trail of continuous flow of terrorists trained and armed by our neighbour and tasked to carry out terrorist attacks in my country.
What we see in Pakistan, Mr. President, is a terrorist state, which channelizes billions of dollars, much of it diverted from international aid, to training, financing and supporting terrorist groups as militant proxies against it neighbours.
Terrorist entities and their leaders, including many designated by the UN, continue to roam its streets freely and operate with State support. With the approval of authorities, many terrorist organizations raise funds openly in flagrant violation of Pakistan’s international obligations.
Mr President,
Even today we have heard support by the Prime Minister of Pakistan for a self-acknowledged commander of a known terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen. Pakistan is a country with a democracy deficit. In fact it practices terrorism on its own people. It extends support to extremist groups, it suppresses minorities and women and denies basic human rights including through draconian laws.
As a democracy India is firmly resolved to protect all our citizens from all acts of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. We cannot and will not allow terrorism to prevail. Finally, Mr President, we have heard Pakistan, whose nuclear proliferation record is marked by deception and deceit, talking about restraint, renunciation and peace.
Similar false promises it has made to us – the international community – on terrorism. Perhaps renunciation of lies and self-restraint on threats could be a good place for Pakistan to start.
I thank you Mr President."

In what can be called a first, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal – who’s usually at loggerheads with Prime Minister Narendra Modi – said he “salutes” him for his response to Uri attack. In a 2-minute 52-second video released online, Kejriwal said, “I may have a hundred differences with the Prime Minister but I salute him for the will he has shown in this matter (surgical strikes on Pakistan).”
But he also pointed out how Pakistan is denying the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Army on September 29 and asking international media to report the same. To clarify matters, the Delhi CM urged Modi, “unmask the false propaganda of Pakistan”.
In a series of tweets, he asked the Centre to “counter” Pakistan’s claims and also asked people not to believe Pakistan’s reports on the surgical strike.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As soon Kejriwal tweeted the video, #AKBackModiOnPak, a hashtag he used with the video, started trending on Twitter but in no time another hashtag started doing the rounds, #KejriwalDoubtsIndianArmy.
Twitterati interpreted the video as Kejriwal’s “smart move” of asking Modi to prove the strike did happen. Here’s how they reacted.

The five-nation powerful grouping of BRICS on Sunday asked all countries to prevent “terrorist actions” from their territories and called for expeditious adoption of an India-backed global convention by the UN to fight the menace effectively. A declaration adopted at the annual summit of grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, violent extremism, radicalisation, recruitment, movement of terrorists including foreign terrorists and blocking sources of financing terrorism.

“We call upon all nations to work together to expedite the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN General Assembly without any further delay,” the Goa declaration issued at the end of the Summit said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It also asked the countries to adopt a “holistic” approach in successfully combating terrorism.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for decisive action to deal with terrorism and described Pakistan as a mothership of global terrorism.
The BRICS said sources of terror funding like organised crime by means of money-laundering, drug trafficking, criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the internet including through social media by terror entities should be focus areas.
“Successfully combating terrorism requires a holistic approach. All counter-terrorism measures should uphold international law and respect human rights,” the declaration said.
Stressing UN’s central role in coordinating multilateral approaches against terrorism, the BRICS urged all nations to undertake effective implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and reaffirmed its commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter terrorism framework.
In the declaration, the BRICS said it reaffirmed commitment to the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) international standards on combating money laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation.
The FATF is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering. In 2001 the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It also called for swift, effective and universal implementation of FATF on combating terrorist financing, including effective implementation of its operational plan.
The BRICS said, “We seek to intensify our cooperation in FATF and FATF-style regional bodies.”
In the declaration, the bloc also called for strengthening of international and regional cooperation and coordination to counter the global threat caused by the illicit production and trafficking of drugs, especially opiates.
“We note with deep concern the increasing links between drug trafficking and terrorism, money laundering and organised crime,” it said, adding there was agreement on strengthening efforts to enhance security in the use of information and communication technology.
The declaration said the bloc agreed that emerging challenges to global peace and security and to sustainable development require further enhancing of its collective efforts.
“We note the global character of current security challenges and threats confronting the international community.
“We reiterate our view that international efforts to address these challenges, the establishment of sustainable peace as well as the transition to a more just, equitable and democratic multi-polar international order requires a comprehensive, concerted and determined approach, based on spirit of solidarity, mutual trust and benefit, equity and cooperation,” it said.
It said, “We express our concern that political and security instability continues to loom in a number of countries that is exacerbated by terrorism and extremism.
“We call upon the international community through the United Nations, African Union and regional and international partners to continue their support in addressing these challenges, including post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts.”

‘

In reference to tax system, it reaffirmed commitment towards a globally fair and modern tax system and and welcomed the progress made on effective and widespread implementation of the internationally agreed standards.
“We support the strengthening of international cooperation against corruption, including through the BRICS Anti-Corruption Working Group, as well as on matters related to asset recovery and persons sought for corruption.
“We acknowledge that corruption including illicit money and financial flows, and ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign jurisdictions is a global challenge which may impact negatively on economic growth and sustainable development.
“We will strive to coordinate our approach in this regard and encourage a stronger global commitment to prevent and combat corruption on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other relevant international legal instruments,” it said.
BRICS also welcomed the Paris Climate Agreement and its imminent entry into force on 4 November.
“We call on the developed countries to fulfil their responsibility towards providing the necessary financial resources, technology and capacity building assistance to support the developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement,” it said.
Asked why the declaration, which names ISIS, does not mention Pakistan-based terror groups, especially JeM which the UN has proscribed, Amar Sinha, Secretary (Economic relations), said a consensus could not be evolved.
He also pointed out India is the victim of the actions of Pakistani terror groups, and not other BRICS nations.
“I guess it does not concern them mainly, BRICS. It affects us. Because Pakistan-based outfits are also focused on India in terms of activities. So since…(it does not affect them), I guess we could not get an consensus on actually including both.
“But if you see, it says ISIS and various other affiliated organisations. and I think there is a reference of terrorists organisations which are designated by the UN,” he said.
He said the fact remains that Pakistani terror groups have not yet reached South Africa and Brazil. “They may one day, we don’t know,” he said.
In reply to a series of questions on the issue of terror at a press briefing later, he said the multilateral summit should not be reduced to just the issue terrorism.
He defended the non-inclusion of the word “cross-border terrorism” in the Goa declaration saying that focus should be on idea.
He said it was important that India was able to bring everyone onboard with its ideas.
Sinha explained that the declaration accepts that there cannot be a political justification of terror and asks countries to take comprehensive steps against terror.
“I think the message is very clear and you don’t have to spell out everything. You have to see what is the underlying thrust,” he said.
Asked about Chinese President Xi Jingping’s speech in which he talked about the need to focus on the root causes, Sinha said he does not know what he meant by “root causes”.
He said China has always said one needs to sit down and that he does not don’t think they were referring to root causes of terrorism.
If that were the case, they would not support the CCIT, he said.
The senior diplomat underlined that India was “satisfied” with the Goa declaration.
“Each country in such negotiations that we have done starts from the national position and then it all gets negotiated over long session until you reach a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone.
“We are obviously not looking…that our national position needs to be sort of signed on dotted lines by other countries,” he said.
He pointed out that the declaration mentions terrorism as unprecedented global threat to peace and security. “These are strong words. I don’t think they are underplaying,” he said.
“We are quite happy with it,” he said, adding this is not the last summit and the one of the NSAs is coming up."

SOUTH BLOCK always had wordsmiths. But over the last few months, as India works towards naming and shaming Pakistan, their skill is on display more than ever. On Sunday morning, PM Narendra Modi called Pakistan the “mothership of terrorism” at the BRICS summit. And in the evening, at the BRICS-BIMSTEC summit, he said, “Terrorism is Pakistan’s favourite child”.

A few weeks ago, at the United Nations, India described Pakistan as the “Ivy League of terrorism”, which hit global headlines. A top official, entrusted with drafting the PM’s speeches, told The Indian Express, “Ever since the government decided to isolate Pakistan globally, we have been working on his speeches and trying to come up with innovative ways to describe Pakistan’s links with terrorism.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that while South Block doesn’t have a dearth of in-house talent, they have been also reaching out to “outside experts”. “There are retired diplomats, MPs, sometimes even ministers, writers and journalists who are being tapped to give suggestions,” said the official.
The phrase “Ivy League of terrorism” was apparently coined by Indian diplomats in New York. “The intensity and frequency of use of such phrases is an outcome of our diplomatic offensive to isolate Pakistan globally,” said an official.
Traditionally, Pakistan was always described as a country which uses terrorism as an instrument of state policy. “This formulation was used by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh… it was used since the days of Rajiv Gandhi,” said Dilip Sinha, former joint secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs who was in charge of Pakistan."

The brother of one of two Pakistani teenagers held on suspicion of facilitating a terrorist attack on the 12 Infantry Brigade’s headquarters in Uri, in which 19 soldiers were killed, has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to order a review of the case, saying he hopes Islamabad’s decision to release Indian soldier Chandu Babulal Chavan will clear the way for his sibling to be sent home too.
“Faisal Awan, my brother, is just a schoolchild trapped in the politics of two nations,” said Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum, a medical practitioner in Lahore. “He is innocent, but we have no means whatsoever to help him. We feel like we are living in a bad film. I hope Prime Minister Modi hears our appeal.”

Tabassum’s appeal comes amid delicate behind-the-scenes diplomatic contacts between India and Pakistan, aimed at lowering tensions which flared in September following the Uri attack and India’s counter-strikes on terrorist outposts across the Line of Control (LoC).
Awan, a resident of Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and his school friend Ahsan Khursheed, from Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil, were arrested on September 21, three days after the Uri attack. Both the villages are close to the LoC.
In a dossier presented to Pakistan, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) claimed the two had confessed to facilitating the “infiltration of a group of four Jaish-e-Muhammad cadres who carried out the Uri Army camp attack”.
However, Tabassum said the two are minors and not linked to any terrorist group. As reported by The Indian Express, Awan’s government-issued identification shows he is 16 years old, and a marksheet issued in August 2016 corroborates his family’s claims that he is a student of Shaheen Model School in Muzaffarabad.
“I can only appeal to people in India to imagine what our family is going through,” said Tabassum. “We would be more than happy to provide evidence of my brother’s innocence, but nobody from India has been in touch with us to ask for it”.
Last week, NIA Director-General Sharad Kumar said the Uri attack was carried out by the Lashkar-e-Taiba, not the Jaish-e-Muhammad as first claimed by the Army and MEA. Kumar declined any comment on the two teenagers’ case, saying investigations were going on. However, a senior NIA source said the agency had not, so far, found any material evidence to suggest the two were linked to the Uri attack or other terrorist operations.
Though a senior Pakistani diplomat familiar with the negotiations said there was “no linkage” between the teenagers’ case and Chavan’s release, he said the “matter was being dealt with separately”.
A senior Indian government official also denied that the two cases were linked, but said the Ministry of Home Affairs’ position on the teenagers’ case was that “the life of an Indian national is of paramount importance”. Pakistan had denied consular access to Chavan and Kulbhushan Jadhav, another alleged spy.
Zeero Begum, Awan’s mother, has been reportedly undergoing treatment for shock and hypertension ever since her son’s arrest. “I’ve had to tell her a hundred lies to calm her down,” said Tabassum. “Now, she believes my brother is being kept in some kind of juvenile facility, not a jail, and that he phones me occasionally. I make up stories about him being well-fed and comfortable.”
He said she can only sleep with the help of medication. “I’ve arranged for her to be kept sequestered from friends and family, just in case someone lets out the truth about what’s really going on,” he said.
Khursheed’s mother, said Tabassum, has not spoken at all since she learned of his arrest. His father, a cook, works in Saudi Arabia, and has been unable to get leave to return home.
Local police sources in Muzaffarabad said both teenagers had skipped a school picnic on September 21 as they planned to meet a girl. Their rendezvous, however, soured after the boys ran into the girl’s family, and they reportedly fled into the nearby woods, losing their way and crossing the LoC by mistake.
Following their arrest, the two teenagers provided several contradictory accounts to interrogators — some of which is now known to be untrue. In an October 3 statement, the NIA claimed Awan identified one of the four slain terrorists behind the Uri attack as Hafiz Ahmad, who, he said, was the son of Feroze, a resident of Dharbang village, west of Murree.
But the only attacker to be identified so far is Gujranwala resident Muhammad Anas, code-named Abu Siraqa, for whom the Lashkar-e-Taiba held funeral prayers. “It is possible the teenagers were frightened or coerced when they gave us their early testimony,” said an NIA official.
The NIA has since succeeded in recovering data from one of two Global Positioning System sets carried by the terrorists who attacked Uri, showing they used electronic means to guide them across the LoC. The data shows the men travelled along the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar road towards the LoC on September 17, before beginning to hike into the mountains short of Chakothi, the official border point.
After they penetrated the LoC south of Chakothi on the night of September 17, the men continued to walk eastward, traversing three ridgelines before climbing towards the village of Darah Goolan, where they rested before attacking the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in the bowl below."

By inviting leaders from the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) countries, Kyrgyz Republic and Mauritius at his swearing-in ceremony on May 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a carefully calibrated diplomatic move that signals a major outreach to India’s neighbourhood from the Bay of Bengal to Central Asia, as well as the Indian diaspora across the world.
Last time, Modi had invited the SAARC leaders, and then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s attendance had raised hopes of a new beginning in the bilateral ties. This time, SAARC’s exclusion is clearly aimed at keeping Pakistan out of New Delhi’s engagement with its neighbours.
Who are invited for PM Modi swearing-in, and why
By inviting the leader from Kyrgyz Republic, India is displaying an outreach to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which is headed by the Kyrgyz leader, and which has China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan as members. India, which became a member along with Pakistan in 2017, wants to leverage its membership to advance its strategic objectives — counter-terrorism and connectivity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
And Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, who was also the chief guest at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in January this year, is one of the most well-placed People of Indian Origin in the world. Since Modi has invested diplomatic capital in outreach to the Indian diaspora since 2014, this invite is seen as a natural choice.
The key message, however, is the outreach to BIMSTEC, which includes Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan, besides India.


	ExplainedMoving to break new groundThis is another effort to reach out diplomatically to the neighbourhood, diaspora and the China-Russia-led regional grouping of Central Asian countries. While PM’s SAARC effort last time failed to take off owing to strained ties with Pakistan, much will depend on the progress Delhi makes with these groupings.

From SAARC to BIMSTEC
New Delhi’s engagement with BIMSTEC rose from the ashes of SAARC. In October 2016, following the Uri attack, India gave a renewed push for the grouping that had existed for almost two decades but been largely ignored. Alongside the BRICS summit in Goa, Modi hosted an outreach summit with BIMSTEC leaders.
That September, some of these BIMSTEC countries had supported New Delhi’s call for a boycott of the SAARC summit scheduled in Islamabad in November 2016. As the summit was postponed, India had claimed victory in isolating Pakistan, having accused that country of carrying out the Uri attack.
Suddenly, BIMSTEC had emerged as a regional platform where five SAARC countries could gather and discuss sub-regional cooperation. India had long felt that the vast potential of SAARC was being under-utilised and opportunities were being lost due to either a lack of response and/or an obstructionist approach from Pakistan.
The search for an alternative, in fact, had been evident at the 2014 SAARC summit in Kathmandu, where Modi had said opportunities must be realised “through SAARC or outside it” and “among us all or some of us.” That was an important signal to Pakistan, as well as to fellow SAARC members.
“As former Indian ambassador to Myanmar Rajiv Bhatia once noted that BIMSTEC was at risk of being little more than a ‘rebound relationship’ whenever New Delhi fails to pursue regional integration SAARC,” Constantino Xavier, fellow at Brookings India, wrote in a paper in February 2018 for Carnegie India.
Joyeeta Bhattacharjee, Senior Fellow with ORF, however, wrote in a paper in January 2018: “Since the SAARC summit has only been postponed, not cancelled, the possibility of revival remains. The success of BIMSTEC does not render SAARC pointless; it only adds a new chapter in regional cooperation in South Asia.”
Two years after the BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach summit and the BIMSTEC leaders’ retreat, the fourth BIMSTEC summit was held in Kathmandu in September 2018. The outcome was considered quite comprehensive, spanning from blue economy to counter-terrorism, although it was only the fourth summit in 21 years.

Why the region matters
The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world. Over one-fifth (22%) of the world’s population live in the seven countries around it, and they have a combined GDP close to $2.7 trillion.
Despite economic challenges, all these seven countries have been able to sustain average annual rates of economic growth between 3.4% and 7.5% from 2012 to 2016. The Bay also has vast untapped natural resources. One-fourth of the world’s traded goods cross the Bay every year.
In an effort to integrate the region, the grouping was formed in 1997, originally with Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and later included Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. BIMSTEC, which now includes five countries from South Asia and two from ASEAN, is a bridge between South Asia and Southeast Asia. It includes all the major countries of South Asia, except Maldives, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Arguing on “Prospects for a Bay of Bengal community”, scholar V Suryanarayan, wrote in Seminar in 2000 that few people in India are conscious of the fact that Phuket in Thailand is only 273 nautical miles from Indira Point, which is less than the distance between Chennai and Madurai.

India’s stake
As the region’s largest economy, India has a lot at stake. In the 20th anniversary speech in 2017, Modi said BIMSTEC connects not only South and Southeast Asia, but also the ecologies of the Great Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal. “For India, it is a natural platform to fulfil our key foreign policy priorities of ‘Neighborhood First’ and ‘Act East’,” he said.
For New Delhi, one key reason for engagement is in the vast potential that is unlocked with stronger connectivity. Almost 300 million people, or roughly one-quarter of India’s population, live in the four coastal states adjacent to the Bay of Bengal (Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal). And, about 45 million people, who live in landlocked Northeastern states, will have the opportunity to connect via the Bay of Bengal to Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, opening up possibilities in terms of development.
From the strategic perspective, the Bay of Bengal, a funnel to the Malacca straits, has emerged a key theatre for an increasingly assertive China in maintaining its access route to the Indian Ocean. Beijing has undertaken massive drive to finance and develop infrastructure in South and Southeast Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative in almost all BIMSTEC countries, except Bhutan and India.
As China mounts assertive activities in the Bay of Bengal region, with increased submarine movement and ship visits in the Indian Ocean, it is in India’s interest to consolidate its internal engagement among the BIMSTEC countries."

As the tensions have heightened, Modi is expected to assess the situation on the ground, sources said.

Pakistan has insisted that there was no strike by India even as its Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has called a cabinet meeting on Friday.
India carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, with the Army saying it had inflicted ‘significant casualties’ on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK, days after Modi warned Uri attack would not go unpunished.

Pakistan has conveyed to India that its Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz will be attending the Heart of Asia (HoA) conference in Amritsar on December 3 and 4. “We have received an official confirmation from Pakistan that Aziz would be attending the HoA conference on Afghanistan,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said Wednesday. The conference, which will be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, will see participation of over 40 countries.
Watch What Else Is Making News

This would be the first high-level visit from Pakistan after the announcement of Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue (CBD) in December last year which never took off in the wake of terror strikes, including the Pathankot airbase attack by Pakistan-based terror groups in January this year, and subsequent incidents which led to intense tension between the two countries.
Given that Aziz, while announcing his visit, had asserted that it could be a “good opportunity” to “defuse the tension” between India and Pakistan, it is in all probability that a bilateral meeting may be on the cards. However, there is no official confirmation in this regard.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While Indian officials are tight-lipped whether there would be a bilateral on the sidelines of the multilateral conference, it is understood that Pakistan is of the opinion that India should initiate such a proposal.
It also remains to be seen whether Aziz’s counterpart Sushma Swaraj will be travelling to Amritsar to attend the conference given that she is not well. That may result in either one of her junior ministers or some other cabinet ministers attending the conference.
In December last year, the meeting of the HoA process was hosted by Pakistan and Swaraj had attended it after which she had bilateral talks with Aziz and announced resumption of CBD.
India had recently boycotted the SAARC summit which was scheduled to be held in Islamabad. Citing continuous cross-border terrorism from Pakistan following the Uri attack, India had said that “in the present circumstances” it was unable to take part in the SAARC summit.
Aziz was quoted as saying that “Unlike India, that had sabotaged SAARC summit in Pakistan by pulling out, Pakistan will respond by participating in the Heart of Asia (conference) being held in India. It’s a good opportunity to defuse the tension.”"

The movement of troops and armaments was known as Operation Parakaram (Strength or Prowess). A political decision had been taken to respond to the attack militarily and diplomatically, and Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha had to issue instructions to release funds at a difficult time — there was a deceleration in the global economy, India was facing one of its worst droughts ever, and the 9/11 attacks had plunged the world as a whole into uncertainty.

Indeed, there were worries that fullscale war would break out. But as Sinha recalls, no Finance Minister could have, in that situation, put a squeeze on defence spending. In any case, for many years, including in his tenure, the experience in the Ministry was that actual capital spending by the Defence Ministry was way below allocations in the Budget, leading to savings. And while extra spending wasn’t a major issue, there was also comfort in prevailing macroeconomic indicators.
Inflation remained pretty low well well into 2002, and India had ended 2001-02 with a surplus on the current account after 24 years. That was also the year when the country had the biggest build-up of foreign exchange reserves in a year — with buoyant inflows, including portfolio flows, during April-November 2001 of over $ 1 billion. As a result of a conscious decision by policymakers to augment reserves, the government had raised over $ 4 billion through the State Bank of India’s India Millennium Deposits in 2001-02. Net foreign investment inflows in the 2001-02 fiscal — $ 5.29 billion — were high, and the comfortable situation was reflected in foreign exchange reserves topping $ 50 billion by January 2002. By end-December 2001, the rupee too had strengthened.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Across North Block, Sinha’s colleague, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, who was also in charge of Defence then, was at work on the diplomatic front. India’s point of view was conveyed to various countries. India recalled its High Commissioner to Pakistan, Vijay Nambiar, and stopped the Samjhauta Express and Delhi-Lahore bus after Pakistan banned Indian flights in its airspace, forcing aircraft to take a longer route via Tehran to western destinations. Prime Minister Vajpayee travelled to the UN and major global capitals — Moscow, London and Washington to build pressure on Pakistan.
There was tremendous pressure from western powers to show restraint. President George W Bush’s Secretary of State Colin Powell, a former four-star general himself, and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, came to India to counsel restraint. Germany and the European Union too put pressure on India to demobilise.
In the Budget for 2002-03, Sinha announced Rs 65,000 crore for Defence, and said he would not hesitate to provide more for the modernisation and upgradation of the country’s defence preparedness. But by August of that year, Sinha had to move out — exchanging his job with Singh, and breaking the news to his officers at a farewell meeting a little before the final withdrawal of troops began. There would be a little more of diplomacy in North Block and more Finance in South Block where he was headed, Sinha famously said.
By the time the nine-month troop mobilisation ended, the pick-up in industry and services was clear. By the end of that year (2002), though net foreign portfolio flows were only $ 49 million in the April-November period — a reverse compared to a year ago — foreign exchange reserves had crossed $ 75 billion, and external debt indicators had improved; India even prepaid foreign loans worth $ 3 billion with a current account surplus. Given the situation, Sinha says, India did not feel the need to push aggressively to counter any possible impact on inflows.
Fifteen years on, the situation is similar. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to respond. And this time too, the macroeconomic indicators are good: inflation is relatively low and the currency is fairly stable — but like in 2001, the economic rebound is probably a few quarters away."

Kashmir: Old memories and fears return to villages on LoC
Mir Ehsan, Srinagar
The moment news about India’s strike across the Line of Control reached Tangdhar town, worried parents rushed to schools to bring their children back home.
Villagers and townspeople near the LoC are worried about the possible return of cross-border shelling, which had claimed dozens of civilian lives in Uri, Tangdhar and Gurez sectors. The ceasefire between India and Pakistan in 2003 had brought relief for villagers but the worries started with the recent deterioration of India-Pakistan relations that peaked with the terrorist attack on an Army base in Uri.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“I came to know about the raids from television and, fearing a reprisal from across the border, I brought my children back from school,” said Mohammad Arshad of Tangdhar town, whose location places it within range of any possible shelling from Pakistan. “Before the ceasefire, shells regularly used to land in our town and villages and dozens of people died. If shelling happens again, it is always the poor who will pay the price.”
The market in Tangdhar shut earlier than usual. “I usually close in the evening but today I went home in the afternoon. There could be reply from Pakistan,” said Iqbal Khan, who runs a shop. “All my neighbours are talking about shelling coming back.”
Border residents had built underground bunkers in the days of shelling but most of those are unusable now, damaged in the 2005 earthquake, and villagers didn’t bother to reconstruct them in view of the ceasefire.
Of the 102 villages in Uri, more than half are within range of Pakistan’s artillery. In the past, misdirected shells had often landed in the homes of civilians. And in the late 1990s, hundreds of villagers had migrated to Baramulla township. “Though it is peaceful here now, we are scared,” admitted Ghulam Nabi Khwaja of Garkote village close to the LoC. “Earlier, we had the safety of underground bunkers, As we no longer have that, we will be sitting ducks if shelling happens.”

During the day, while Uri market was open, shopkeepers and customers kept watching the TV news. “So far nothing has happened in our town or neighbouring villages but villages who live on the zero line left the market early to be with their families,” said Mohammad Ashraf Khan, a shopkeeper.
At Dawar Gurez, shops shut in the afternoon and people of Kazalwan, Neil and Wanpora villages headed to an underground tunnel built for the Kishanganga power project. The Army has restricted movement of civilians in Gurez, especially on the LoC.
Punjab: Women and children move to relatives’ homes, men stay back 
Raakhi Jagga, Ludhiana
Following the Punjab government’s order to evacuate villages in a 10-km radius of the border, women and children from hundreds of villages in Punjab’s Fazilka and Ferozepur districts left for relatives’ homes farther away from the border. The men, however, stayed back, as many had done during the Indo-Pak wars in 1965, 1971 and 1999.
Lachman Singh from Beriwala village in Fazilka, 150 villages of which fall in the 10-km radius of the border, said: “A few people from every village had stayed back even during the 1971 and 1965 war to take care of their belongings. We don’t want a war, because it will affect us the most, but we are ready for whatever comes.”
As for Ferozepur, 304 villages of the district fall in the 10-km radius of the border. BJP leader from the district, Sukhpal Singh Nannu, said,” I recall that during the Kargil war, most villagers in Hussainiwala area had stayed back. They had also arranged langar for the security personnel. Villagers are in upbeat mood. No doubt they need to be careful, but they are confident. There is not much tension.”
Sandeep Kumar of Bareke in Ferozepur district, who travels to the town daily to work, said, “I was anxious after watching the news. When I called up my parents back home, they said only a few people living near the fence have started moving out.”
In Tindiwala, which is nearest to the border among villages in Ferozepur district, people said they had packed jewellery, cash, a few clothes and furniture before moving out.
The deputy commissioners of Fazilka and Ferozepur said 26 relief camps have been set up in schools and colleges of each district. In Ferozepur, all schools and colleges have been closed.
Fazilka DC Isha Kalia said, “We have set up camps outside the 10 km radius and will provide all facilities to people who shift there. As of now, people are moving to their relatives’ places. There is no need to panic. “
DC, Ferozepur, D P S Kharbanda said, “It is not compulsory for villagers to move out, but those willing can move to the camps and we will take care of them.”
Gujarat: Coast Guard and BSF on high alert but border villagers will stay home
Express News Service, Ahmedabad/Rajkot
Security agencies in Gujarat, which shares a 508 km border with Pakistan, were put on high alert on Thursday. While the BSF intensified patrolling on the land border, the Coast Guard have been asked to maintain vigil in the sea, official sources said Thursday.
Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said, “Following the surgical strikes, high alert has been sounded across Gujarat, specially in the three districts — Banaskantha, Patan and Kutch — that share border with Pakistan. Coastal police stations have also been alerted to increase the vigil.”
“No evacuation (of villages along the Pakistan border) has been ordered as of now,” said defence spokesperson Wing Commander Abhishek Matiman.
Deputy CM Patel said the Home Ministry had instructed all border states to evacuate villages within 10 km of international border. However, we do not have any village within that range. All Gujarat villages are beyond 25 km range of the border,” Patel added. He said that the additional chief secretary (home) was in constant touch with various central security agencies to preempt any untoward incident.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani hailed India’s surgical attack across the LoC as a “consolation” to the martyred soldiers. The CM held a meeting with top government officials to review security arrangements in the state, especially in three districts bordering Pakistan.
Rupani said the government had instructed the administration in all the three districts to provide all necessary assistance to the BSF, Coast Guard, Navy and Army, as and when required. The meeting was attended by state Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja, in charge DGP P P Pandey, and senior IAS officers.
In Saurashtra, fishermen have been asked not to venture at the sea until further instructions while security forces and intelligence network have been alerted in Kutch along the border with Pakistan. Manish Lodhari, general secretary of Gujarat chapter of National Fishworkers Forum, said they too have asked fishermen to remain cautious.
In Jammu, border villages in panic after alert
Arun Sharma, Jammu
Villagers living along the border in Jammu are in panic after the state government sounded an alert in over 300 villages near the LoC, asking them to stay ready for evacuation. Of the nearly 300 villages in the five border districts — Kathua, Samba, Jammu, Rajouri and Pooch — 120 fall along the border and the others along the LoC. DCs of all five districts have been asked to put in place a contingency plan for evacuation of people in the event of firing and shelling by Pakistani troops, official sources told The Indian Express, adding that so far, they had not evacuated anyone.
Nearly 30 per cent of people in Bengalad, Galad and Chak Fakira villages in Samba district have shifted to alternate accommodation or relatives homes’, said sarpanch of Bengalad Ram Lal. Residents of these villages said they have been told to spend the night at Chichi Mata temple, far off from the border.
Basharat Ahmed, who lives in along the LoC in the Balakote area of Poonch, said that though people were yet to migrate, there was tension due to news reports. However, there has not been much movement of troops, he added. Even migrant labourers from UP, Bihar and other parts of the country have started receiving calls from family members, asking them to return home. “I got a call from my wife, asking me to return home as she has heard that war can break out between India and Pakistan,’’ said Ram Saran of Bihar.
Rajasthan: Alert in place, no evacuation plan
Express News Service, Jaipur
Rajasthan’s BORDER districts have been on alert for three days now but the government has not called for the evacuation of villages, Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said. Following the Army’s strike, Kataria met Thursday evening with police and civil administration officials. “We asked the Army if there was anything that was needed from us, but we were told there is no cause for worry and will be informed if something is required of us,” Kataria said, congratulating the Army for a “successful surgical strike”. He said the alert was sounded three days ago.
Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje “saluted” the Army for the strike, terming it a moonh-tod jawab to Pakistan.
In Army’s build-up in Uri, village meets, hospital visit
Mir Ehsan, Srinagar
In the build-up to India’s strikes on the Line of Control, the Army had been interacting frequently with villagers near the LoC and, on Wednesday afternoon, had sought to assess the preparedness of the only large civilian hospital close to the LoC — the sub-district hospital in Uri.
Two officials of 12 Infantry Brigade stationed in Uri visited the hospital. “They asked about the operation theatre and other facilities and left,” a doctor said.
Since the Uri attack, officials of local units had been meeting village heads and other leaders and asking them to report any suspected movement to the nearest Army unit. “We were asked not to venture out after 6 pm. They said this was a precautionary measure after the attack on the camp,” said a village head in Uri who attended one such meeting in his village near the LoC.
Col Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman in Srinagar, said the Army interacts regularly with village leaders but denied there is no restriction in the movement of civilians. “Some coordination is required for the safety of the local population so that no untoward incident takes place during patrols,” he said.
In Gwalata, Churunda and Silikote situated on or near the LoC, villagers said there has been increase in the movement of soldiers close to the LoC.
“We have border passes, but if any relative who lives in other village intends to visit us, we have to register his name in the camp,’’ said a villager in Silikote.
The Army claimed to have arrested two guides Sunday, reportedly residents of PoK, from border areas in Uri. They have been now handed over to the NIA that is investigating the terrorist attack.
Troopers of 19 Infantry Division based in Baramulla and 28 Infantry Division based in Kupwara were reportedly engaged in operations launched from Nowgam and Tangdhar sectors.
The 19 Infantry Division has been under pressure since the terrorist attack on the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri.
Rajnath briefs border state CMs, Oppn leaders
Express News Service, New Delhi
Soon after the announcement by the DGMO of surgical strikes carried out by the Army on terrorist launching pads across the Line of Control, Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to chief ministers of border states, former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and H D Deve Gowda, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, and informed them about the operation.
In a series of tweets later in the day, Rajnath said, “Congratulations to the Indian Army on successful counter terrorism operations against terror groups and their launching pads. We are proud of our armed forces. They have once again exhibited exemplary courage and valour by destroying the anti India designs. I also congratulate Prime Minister Shri @Narendramodi on taking a bold decision and showing true grit and mettle in crucial times.”
The morning after the strike: Firing along LoC 
Arun Sharma, Jammu
LESS THAN 12 hours after India carried out “surgical strikes”, an encounter broke out between security forces and some militants at Sagra, in Mendhar sector, along the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday afternoon.
Sources said the militants were suspected to have sneaked in under cover of firing and mortar shelling from across the border, in Balnoi area of Mendhar from 4:30 am to 6 am on Thursday.
Sagra is located near Balnoi, which is on this side of the LoC. It also adjoins Bhimber Gali (BG) sector, from where Indian troops are believed to have carried out the “surgical strikes”.
At about 2 pm on Thursday, security forces at a police naka near the Sagra forest reportedly came under fire. Additional security forces were rushed to the area and joined the operation against the militants, who are suspected to be hiding in the dense forest. While the firing has stopped, the forest area has been cordoned off.
A special police official, identified as Talib Hussain, has been injured in the operation. Sources said he was injured when he slipped from a height.
Meanwhile, nearly a dozen policemen were injured when their vehicle met with an accident, while they were on their way from Poonch to Sagra.
Pakistani troops also violated ceasefire in Kalal area of Nowshera on Thursday morning and at Sawjian on Wednesday night.

The BSF held its retreat ceremony at Wagah as usual on Thursday but turned away busloads of visitors who were arriving to watch it. The BSF also asked its personnel to step back from the zero line and take position behind the fence on the India-Pakistan border on Thursday afternoon. Cross-border trade at the international Check Post at Attari, however, remained normal throughout the day.
Samjhauta Express: Unlike on other days, BSF personnel did not cross the border gate while sending off the Samjhauta Express into Pakistan. The train left as usual with 150 passengers. Earlier, it brought 144 passengers from Pakistan.

(Source: PTI)
In the face of considerable uncertainty, Prime Minister Modi’s first meeting with President Trump appears to have come off well. Setting aside the teeming crowds and spectacles of past visits, the Prime Minister settled for an intimate set of meetings focused on shoring up the US-India partnership and finding common ground with a President who has demonstrated a more unstructured and impulsive style of policymaking than his predecessors.
Prime Minister Modi faced three imperatives in making this visit a success. The first was establishing a personal rapport with President Trump. Although the leaders hail from starkly different personal backgrounds, they brought to their initial meeting a shared impatience for bureaucracy and preference for communicating directly through social media; an unapologetic attitude about advancing their peoples’ economic interests in a competitive global marketplace; and a commitment to dealing with the menace of global terrorism.
Judging from their warm public comments — and multiple embraces — it is fair to conclude that the leaders established some personal chemistry. But this is only a start. I observed first-hand how President Obama developed a real rapport with Prime Minister Modi, forged not simply through consultations on bilateral issues, but frequent conversations about global challenges from climate change to maritime security. To build a strong relationship, Trump and Modi will need to move beyond their early affinity and similarly identify a basket of global issues on which they can seek each other’s advice and support.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister’s second imperative was to use this visit to signal that the US-India relationship remains on solid footing. For well over a decade, the United States and India have been describing the bilateral relationship in increasingly florid language. This rhetorical escalation has reflected deepening ties between the two countries, but has also been a means by which both leaders have prompted their bureaucracies to overcome Cold War hesitations about engaging the other. It was a way of reaffirming that the relationship was special.
It has, however, become abundantly clear that in Trump’s America, ‘special’ is no longer good enough. The new administration’s litmus test seems to be whether a country can prove ‘useful’ to the President’s priorities of job creation and economizing the defense of America’s borders.
On this count as well, the visit modestly exceeded expectations. The Rose Garden statements nicely recapitulated the common values that bind the two countries. And building on the Joint Strategic Vision of 2015, the joint statement reaffirmed an emphasis on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, particularly maritime collaboration; articulated a common understanding of the terrorist threat; highlighted deepening defense ties, including a significant offer of Guardian UAVs that required the administration to overcome a ‘presumption of denial’ under its MTCR obligations; noted cooperation on a surprisingly wide range of energy initiatives, from ‘clean coal’ to renewables; and, in a nod to Trump’s focus on deficits, committed to ‘further expanding and balancing the trade relationship’.
Taken together, the positive rhetoric and these incremental outcomes helped reaffirm that the relationship remains on a steady trajectory.
Modi’s third and final imperative in meeting President Trump was to shape the new administration’s view of India’s regional challenges, particularly those relating to China and Pakistan. Here the fruits of the summit are somewhat less clear. US policy toward China remains inchoate, pegged unrealistically to Chinese support on North Korea. This administration’s China hawks — who are pointedly critical of Beijing’s trade practices and soft expansionism in Asia — may well gain the upper hand in the coming months.
China was something of an unspoken apparition in the leaders’ public remarks. The joint statement reaffirmed the US-India strategic convergence in Asia, highlighting a shared concern over North Korea and posed a thinly-veiled critique of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. But it did not resolve the longer-term question of whether India and the United States will arrive at a similar view of the challenge that China poses to our shared interests in Asia. Without that common view, the institutional energy behind US-India defence cooperation could eventually wane.
Neither is it entirely clear to what extent Modi was able to shape the President’s views on Pakistan. The White House is in the final stages of developing a South Asia strategy that, in part, seeks to address the problems of cross-border militancy that flow from Pakistani territory. Indeed, the leaders made the most explicit reference ever in high-level US document to Pakistani cross-border militancy, even more forceful than the strong statement issued by National Security Advisor Susan Rice in the wake of the Uri attacks last September.
These statements, bolstered by the US designation of Syed Salahuddin, might suggest that Trump is moving inexorably toward Modi’s view of Pakistan. The reality, however, is more complex. The United States still has numerous equities with Pakistan, and can little afford to alienate Pakistani leaders precisely when it is considering reinvesting in an Afghan peace process. New Delhi may continue to hear a tougher rhetorical line on Pakistan, but so far there are few indications that Trump would be willing to use America’s limited leverage with Pakistan to press for action against India-focused groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, rather than groups like the Haqqani Taliban network that directly target US forces in Afghanistan. That may well change in the aftermath of another cross-border attack into India, but observers should be realistic about how fast and how far the United States will be willing to stress its relationship with Pakistan outside of a crisis environment.
These uncertainties notwithstanding, both leaders can feel good about this summit. But they must not become complacent. What makes for a successful first visit is not enough to make for a successful relationship. There are still substantial irritants, particularly on economic issues. And more than ever before, both sides will face pressure to show that the partnership is not just ‘special’ but ‘useful’ to the other.
For the US, that might mean finding ways to more assertively address India’s regional security concerns; ensure that trade disputes are handled respectfully and creatively; and advocate energetically for India’s leadership role on the global stage. For India, that might mean finding areas in which to make substantive contributions to the global counter-terrorism fight; continuing to purchase US equipment and defense goods, and demonstrating its ability to be a ‘burden-sharing’ defence partner in the Indian Ocean; and making good on its pledges to gradually expand market access to US firms in protected sectors.
These are achievable goals for the US-India relationship under this new administration. Reasonably assured of each other’s commitment, both sides now face the task of sustaining sufficient bureaucratic energy to advance nuts-and-bolts cooperation outside of the public glare. These are not ordinary times. But the foundations of a stronger partnership have ably been laid."
"1618474119-763","https://indianexpress.com/page/11/?s=%22+Uri+%2A+attack%22","Childish","https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/childish-4640985/","Childish","May 5, 2017 12:06:38 am","On September 23, 2016, in his first public address after the Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a distinction between elements within Pakistan that support terrorism and anti-India activities, and its common people. He called on the people of Pakistan to wage war on poverty and under-development alongside their Indian counterparts, and pressure their government to adopt a more peaceful path. The spirit of magnanimity displayed by the PM in that moment has been belied now by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) when it chose to “advise” a Delhi-based NGO to send back students and teachers from the Lahore Grammar School, on a goodwill visit to interact with their Indian counterparts. Reportedly, in light of the “inhuman and brutal” mutilation of Indian security personnel along the Line of Control (LoC) by Pakistani soldiers, the MEA felt it was not an “appropriate time” for such a visit. In fact, it is at difficult times like this that gestures of goodwill between young people from both countries should be seen to be more significant.
The MEA’s advisory is even more difficult to understand given the precedent set by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. In the wake of the “surgical strikes” by India across the LoC in September last year, the minister encouraged a group of Pakistani students to remain in Chandigarh for a conference they were attending in the city and ensured their safe return. That was a reaction that behoves a country of India’s size and values. Yet, just months later, the MEA seems to have forgotten that India’s engagement with Pakistan goes far beyond the exchanges along the LoC. Rather than its minister, it seems to be following the example of the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association, which petulantly banned performers and technicians from Pakistan working in the Mumbai film industry last year.
The beheading of Indian soldiers has generated understandable anger and outrage. The army and the government of India have taken it up with the highest levels in Pakistan. But the blunders of the Pakistani establishment cannot allow the MEA, and the government, to forget that dialogue is the only way out. To keep that possibility alive, engagement with Pakistan must be layered and continuous. Initiatives like the student exchange that was abruptly called off ensure that the people of both countries continue to speak even when governments trade accusations. The students of the Lahore Grammar School had been writing to their friends in India for a year, and were eager to meet. For future’s sake, they should have been allowed to do so."

IN WHAT could be seen as a tit-for-tat move over Turkey’s statements on J&K, India on Thursday expressed “deep concern” over the “unilateral military offensive” by Turkey in northeastern Syria, and asserted that the action could undermine stability in the region as well as the fight against terrorism.
This is Delhi’s latest signal to the international community that siding with Pakistan will entail disapproval from India.
As Chinese President Xi Jinping comes to India on Friday, the issue of favouring Pakistan on the J&K issue has emerged as the touchstone for a normal diplomatic relationship. “On whether a country is with Pakistan or India, this has become the new loyalty test for Indian diplomacy,” an Indian diplomat told The Indian Express.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The issue of siding with India or Pakistan began with the Uri attack in 2016, when Indian diplomats were activated across the world and statements were solicited from world capitals condemning the terrorist attack — and, if possible, slamming Pakistan.

The issue came up again when the Pulwama terrorist attack took place in February this year. Once again, ambassadors were called and asked to convey to their respective capitals to issue statements.
The trend continued, as many countries were asked to speak in favour of India’s right to self-defence — the US support also came, and an emboldened Delhi carried out the Balakot air strikes.

(Reuters)
Following the government’s August 5 decision to revoke J&K’s special status and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories, the diplomatic community was activated again. The challenge, this time, was that it involved a ground situation. So, although world leaders like US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron supported India’s move, there were statements from the US and French administration on the issue of human rights.


	ExplainedShow of strengthIndia’s statement on Turkey’s offensive is rather unusual, and is being seen as a response to Turkey’s statements on J&K over the last two months. Since 2011, when the turmoil began in Syria, India has never targeted Turkey or any other country which is involved. It is a symptom of India’s muscle-flexing against Pakistan.

However, China, Turkey and Malaysia have been critical of India’s move on Kashmir. And, India has reacted very sharply.
In early October, India said it “deeply regrets” the statements of Turkey and Malaysia attacking New Delhi on the Kashmir issue, and termed it an internal matter.
MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar asked Ankara to have a proper understanding of the situation before making further comments. “India and Turkey are friendly countries. We, therefore, deeply regret that since August 6, there have been repeated statements by the Turkish government on a matter completely internal to India. These statements are factually incorrect, biased and unwarranted,” he said.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad raised the Kashmir issue at the United Nations, alleging that India had “invaded and occupied” J&K and asked New Delhi to work with Islamabad to resolve the issue.
“We have noted the comment on J&K by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. We deeply regret these comments since they are not based on facts,” Kumar said. “Government of Malaysia should bear in mind the friendly relations between the two countries and desist from making such comments,” he added.
So, India’s statement on Turkey needs to be viewed in this context.
On Wednesday, Turkish jets and artillery targeted Kurdish-controlled areas in Syria, forcing thousands of civilians to flee their homes.
Reacting to the development, the MEA said in a statement: “We are deeply concerned at the unilateral military offensive by Turkey in northeast Syria.” Turkey’s actions can undermine stability in the region and the fight against terrorism, it said. The action also has the potential to cause humanitarian and civilian distress, the MEA said.
“We call upon Turkey to exercise restraint and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. We urge the peaceful settlement of all issues through dialogue and discussion,” it said.
It is highly unusual for India to react on a third country’s actions in a region which is not India’s immediate neighbourhood. Sources said this was a clear signal to Turkey to be sensitive to India’s interests, and not take sides with Pakistan on J&K.
Sources said a signal is being sent to other countries as well, including the US, where a US Congress hearing is likely to take place on October 22 on the J&K situation. Already, several US Congressmen and European parliamentarians have criticised India for the communication shutdown and restrictions."

He later made a second call and threatened about shooting dead the cops stationed outside police headquarters, he said. The Ghaziabad Police conveyed the message to their Delhi counterparts. In wake of the Uri attack and intelligence inputs of a terror threat on the national capital, the premises was thoroughly scanned and it turned out that it was a hoax call.

A case was registered at the IP Estate police station and investigation was initiated in the matter, police said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Police located Manoj from Ghaziabad but he denied about making a threat call. He expressed suspicion about his friend Sonu who was arrested on October 1 from Ghaziabad’s Khoda Colony, said the officer.
Sonu confessed to making a hoax call just to take revenge from his friend Manoj, police said.
“Sonu and Manoj are good friends and Sonu used to visit Manoj’s house often. Once Sonu was scolded by Manoj for joking with his wife. This angered Sonu who thought of making a hoax call by impersonating as Manoj,” said the officer.Delhi NewsDelhi HC says its conscience is shaken, dismisses bail plea of gun-toting riot accusedDelhi: In second wave, more children and infants in hospital with Covid-19E-rickshaw driver arrested for sexually assaulting two minorsClick here for more

(Source: Express photo by Manoj Aligadi)
You are set to complete 4½ years as vice chancellor. How has it been?
It’s great, much more challenging than commanding a troop of 50,000 Army men and seven Northeast states fighting insurgency. But I have a sense of satisfaction at what I achieved here… The university was not shut for even a day… A US ranking has [placed] AMU second best in India… We have restored most of the historical buildings, anything beyond repair has been demolished. We are carrying out research… recycling water and waste through plant technology… I told the Prime Minister you won’t get rivers clean unless you get eco-battalions for Ganga and Yamuna… More than anything else, it’s the psychological impact of AMU being involved in Project Ganga, shows that the river is sacred to us also, not just sacred to Hindus.
WATCH VIDEO: President Pranab Mukherjee Gives Nod To Hold Inquiry Against AMU VC Zameeruddin Shahhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


Your appointment has been challenged in the Supreme Court [on grounds of inadequate academic experience]…
Dr Zakir Hussain was a schoolteacher, Hamid Ansari was in foreign service. They did great as VCs. I am a military man. It’s a misconception that we are uneducated baboons. We spent a lifetime in learning and getting educated… Education is very much part of a military officer’s life.
Watch what else is making news:


The AMU Teachers’ Association secretary was suspended, students are on dharna, arson has taken place. Why all this on campus?
I haven’t suspended the AMUTA secretary, I have suspended a teacher who failed to perform his duty. He decided to sit on dharna rather than take classes; he should have taken [leave]… When I asked him, he lied and filed an application, backdated. He misbehaved with me… What was shocking is that he later conducted a meeting to discuss the misbehaviour of the VC… The arson was by outsiders, goons and criminals of Aligarh and very few students who have been rusticated.
You got a lot of support from female students. What are you dong for them?
Yes, I accept that girls have supported me… I have promised them an international swimming pool which is under construction at the women’s hostel. They were earlier mugged on their way as they were living outside. We are going to have a hostel for 2,100 girls at Rs 75 crore… Former HRD minister Smriti Irani asked me why I am wasting money on a swimming pool. I said I am not wasting money, I want girls to be confident.
Your equation with Irani was seen as not smooth. How is it with Prakash Javadekar?
I am yet to meet him. We did shake hands at the VC conclave. Smriti Irani has some allergy to AMU.
The HRD ministry has sought the President’s permission for an inquiry on the AMU VC over various irregularities.
I am ready to face any inquiry any time. AMU is always in the hit-list of the HRD ministry but I must say it’s a conspiracy by those who are not very happy with the development work. All this is the handiwork of one person, a member of AMU’s executive council. We caught him filing fake travel bills and he started a war against the university and me… I must say, an audit inquiry cannot be ordered on the complaint of one person. Still, I welcome an inquiry, it will clear the air.
Has the BJP government helped AMU?
I never had problems with the central government. I have issues with fund allocation. In fact all governments at the Centre were biased against AMU. They never treated us well. When the Congress government was there, we got Rs 100 crore less than BHU. Jamia, which is one third our size, got Rs 50 crore more… But I am sure the Prime Minister will take care of AMU this time.
Why did your statements about the RSS create a controversy?
Because I speak the truth. About RSS, I am talking to them. If somebody is extending his hand to you, you should never neglect it.
So do you agree with RSS’s ideology.
No I don’t. Because they have very insular ideology. I think it has to be secular… I have spoken to top leaders.

I tried to convince them not to meddle with AMU in any way as the sentiments of our community are involved. They shook their heads but never gave any commitment. Even the PM shook his head but didn’t give me any commitment.
AMU expelled a Kashmir student for a post on the Uri attack.
I regret the attack. Our soldiers lost their lives. I also regret the large-scale loss of life in the Valley… AMU

will not tolerate any anti-national activity."

Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath Tuesday criticised the previous UPA government over its way to tackle terrorism and asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi what was his “relation with Ishrat Jahan”, who was killed in an alleged fake encounter by the Gujarat Police in 2004.
Addressing a huge rally in Ghatlodiya area under the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, he also alleged that Gandhi had told the US ambassador that people of India are a “bigger threat” to the country than Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group.
“What is your relation with Ishrat Jahan, a terrorist? When Rahul Gandhi met the US ambassador, he told him that the people of India, and not Jaish-e-Mohammad, are a bigger threat to our country,” alleged Adityanath.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Attacking Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, he said, “They (Rahul and Priyanka) go to temples only during elections. They do not have time to visit holy sites if elections are not around.”
“When they learned that over 24 crore people took part in Kumbh mela (held in Prayagraj recently), the new generation (of the Congress) also dropped by,” he said.
Adityanath was apparently referring to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s recently concluded Ganga Yatra from Prayagraj to Varanasi during which she visited several temples.
He said Gujarat had first exposed Rahul Gandhi when he had visited the Somnath temple in 2017.
“During that visit, a temple priest asked Rahul to sit properly, as his sitting posture resembled someone offering Namaz,” the UP chief minister said.
Referring to Priyanka Gandhi upcoming visit to Ayodhya, the BJP leader alleged that Congress leaders who do not believe in the existence of Lord Ram are now talking about visiting his birth place.
“Some new Congress leaders (Priyanka) are planning to visit Ayodhya. When the supreme court was hearing the case of Ram Setu, the past Congress government had told the court that Lord Ram never existed. Now, people who do not even believe in the existence of Lord Ram are talking about visiting Ayodhya,” he said.
He also attacked the Congress over its promise to roll out the minimum income guarantee scheme for the poor, if voted back to power.
“Rahul Gandhi now says that his party will eradicate poverty from the country. The Congress should first answer that why they could not do so while being in power for 55 years. The Congress can only increase poverty by making false promises,” he said.
Adityanath said unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Opposition leaders lacked compassion for the poor.
“When your (Rahul Gandhi’s) ‘abba jaan’ was PM, he used to say that out of Rs 100 sent by the Centre, only Rs 10 reaches the poor. That was Rajiv Gandhi’s pain. But, nothing was done to correct that situation. We brought in technology to tackle that issue. Now the entire sum of Rs 100 reaches the poor,” he said.
Adityanath praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2016 cross-border surgical strikes and the Balakot air strike, which was conducted in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack.
“Terrorism and anarchy was widespread before 2014. Many terror attacks took place during the UPA rule. China used to transgress into Indian territory. Pakistan was beheading our soldiers. But when people asked that party to respond, they used to say that we will think about it, we might do it. But nothing happened,” he said.
Adityanath said armed forced had actually carried out two surgical strikes—“one on separatists in the North East region and another in PoK after Uri attack”.
He alleged that Congress leaders use abusive language for PM Modi while at the same time they show their respect for terrorists by suffixing “jee” to their names."

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Majeed Memon on Sunday urged all political parties to stand united against state sponsored terrorism and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a very strong condemnatory statement exposing Islamabad before the world as to how the neighbouring nation has misused India’s liberal and flexible approach.
Memon condemned the Uri attack and questioned the BJP-led NDA regime’s future course of action while dealing with the hostile neighbour.
“This would just mean nothing short of external aggression. And I am sure that at this time of grief and test, all political parties and all leaders would stand together side by side along with the Prime Minister and the Home Minister,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We would give a befitting reply to Pakistan and to the whole world would sure that how our liberal and flexible approach has been misused by our neighbour,” he added.
The NCP leader further said it is high time that India must show its strength.
“And we expect that the Prime Minister without the loss of even an hour must come forward and make a very strong condemnatory statement and tell the world that how we have suffered at the hands of our neighbours,” he added.
India has blamed Pakistan for the terrorist attack at an army camp in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, that claimed the lives of 17 soldiers.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has expressed his heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyred soldiers and said those behind this terror incident would be brought to justice.
“Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolated as such,” he said in a series of tweets.
The Home Minister also spoke to Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra and Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and was apprised of the overall situation.
Earlier, he held a high-level meeting in New Delhi and reviewed the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Union Home and Defence Secretaries and top army, paramilitary officials attended the meeting.
Uri has been under the attack for past couple of years as earlier in December 2014, six terrorists attacked the Indian Army camp at Mohura in Uri in which eight soldiers and three police were martyred."

The United States has asked India not to escalate the situation with Pakistan even as New Delhi explores a range of diplomatic options to isolate Islamabad.
The Indian Express has learnt that US Secretary of State John Kerry has had “two conversations” over the “last two days” with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on this issue. Swaraj was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly where she made a speech Monday, targeting Pakistan.

This is the first time that the US has spoken to the Indian leadership at a senior political level after the Uri attack, sources said.
Although it is poll season in the US, the State Department is keeping a close eye on developments in the subcontinent.
These conversations, sources said, happened in the backdrop of India and Pakistan raising the temperature over the last two days. After a review of the implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty on Monday, India decided to pull out of the SAARC summit in Islamabad in November. And on Thursday, New Delhi is to review the Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan.

While the US is watching the diplomatic, political and economic responses by New Delhi very carefully, sources said there is appreciation that the Indian side has acted with a “lot of restraint” following the Uri attack.
After Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met Kerry last week, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said: “We’ve seen some progress; we want to see more, and I think moving forward we’ll just continue to work closely and try to encourage greater counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan but also within the region.”
State Department Spokesperson John Kirby stated later that Kerry “reiterated the need for Pakistan to prevent all terrorists from using Pakistani territory as safe havens, while commending recent efforts by Pakistani security forces to counter extremist violence.”
A readout of the meeting issued by the Pakistan embassy in New York revealed that Sharif had requested the “US Administration and Secretary Kerry to use his good offices to help in resolving bilateral issues between Pakistan and India.” Kerry met Sharif on the sidelines of the UNGA.
On Wednesday, Toner said: “What we have said many times from the podium is that we want to see closer and normalisation of relationship between India and Pakistan. It would benefit the region. We want to see de-escalation in the political discourse between the two countries and greater communication and coordination between them.” Toner said.
The State Department refrained from commenting on India’s decision to pull out of the SAARC Summit. “I would refer you to the Government of India to comment on their decision not to attend this meeting,” Toner said.
Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the US had continued to “encourage India and Pakistan to find ways to resolve their differences, not through violence, but through diplomacy”."

India on Wednesday gave Pakistan evidence of involvement of Pak-based terrorists in the Uri attack and demanded that it refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism directed against this country.
Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and told him that latest terrorist attack in Uri only underlines that the infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan remains active.
WATCH VIDEO: Abdul Basit Interview Excerpts: War Is Not Really A Solution To Our Problemshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Jaishankar provided Basit with the content of GPS recovered from the bodies of terrorists with coordinates that indicate the point and time of infiltration across the LoC and the subsequent route to the terror attack site and grenades with Pakistani markings as evidence of Pakistan’s role in Uri attack in which 18 jawans were killed.
“If the Government of Pakistan wishes to investigate these cross-border attacks, India is ready to provide fingerprints and DNA samples of terrorists killed in the Uri and Poonch incidents,” he told the Pakistan envoy.
Asserting that the latest terrorist attack in Uri only underlines that the infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan remains active, Jaishankar demanded that Pakistan lives up to its public commitment to refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism against India.

He also reminded Basit that the Pakistan government had made a solemn commitment in January 2004 to not allow its soil or territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India. “The persistent and growing violation of this undertaking is a matter of very serious concern,” he told Basit.
In a release, External Affairs Ministry said this year, beginning with the Pathankot airbase attack, there have been continuous attempts by armed terrorists to cross the LoC and International Boundary in order to carry out attacks in India.

“Seventeen such attempts have been interdicted at or around the LoC, resulting in the elimination of thirty one terrorists and preventing their intended acts of terrorism. Foreign Secretary also reminded him that even as he spoke two engagements at the LoC were ongoing,” it said.
Apart from GPS content, India has recovered a number of items that included communication matrix sheets and equipment, other made in Pakistan stuff like food, medicines and clothes, which were shown to Basit.
“We now expect a response from the Government of Pakistan,” Jaishankar told him.
Basit’s summoning came a day after Jaishankar headed a high-level meeting, attended by senior Home Ministry officials and Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), during which the evidence recovered by Indian Army from the terrorists was shared with the MEA."

Amit Chakravarty
INSIDE the plush Metro Cinema in South Mumbai, standing against the brown walls is a row of standees of upcoming movies, and Diwali lanterns. But the faces of Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma, however, are absent on these flexes, though actors from Shivaay, Befikre, Dangal, Tum Bin and Rock On are vying for the ticket-buyer’s attention. A day before the release of Karan Johar-directed Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, it appears that despite assurances of police protection, and after the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s announcement that its agitation against the film has ended, single-screen and multiplexes have preferred to keep ADHM posters small, a little inconspicuous.

“We have been told by Marine Lines police that bandobast will be done on the first day of release,” said H V Naik, on-duty manager at Eros Cinema near Churchgate.
The administration of the cinema hall was informed about the release of the film only Monday. So ,while a large 30 feet by 20 feet poster of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay dominates the entrance hall, the ADHM poster occupies a smaller 30 feet by 10 feet space. Two shows, at 3.30 pm and 9.30 pm, are slotted for now.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I have never seen so much tension over one film. Earlier, our single screen would have 100 per cent audience, now it has reduced to 30 per cent. Who would want to cut down the audience further,” Naik said.
The three-guard team of security at Eros, however, seems relaxed. “We have friendly relations with local political parties in this area. They would not damage our theatre,” said guard Dilip Aadak. It has been only one year since he started working at a theatre, and such experience of anticipated vandalism intrigues him. “I am not scared. But I have never come across anything like this,” he said.
The controversy over Karan Johar’s film picked up pace after MNS threatened to vandalise theatres that dared to screen the Fawad Khan-starrer. Following the Uri attack, the political party has been demanding a ban on all Pakistani artistes in the country.
At Regal Cinema in Colaba, security guard S R Pawar is banking on the nearby police station for security on Friday even as the theatre administration prefers keeping quiet over the issue. With only three guards manning the cinema hall entrance, his five years of experience with political groups has taught Pawar a few tricks. “We immediately call the manager and alert nearby police if we feel there may be problems,” he said.
The theatre has slotted shows at noon and 6.45 pm for ADHM. “We will put up posters of both movies releasing by tomorrow morning,” said manager Mohan Das. He, however, pursed his lips. “What should theatres do in such controversies? We are still not sure if the release will go on smoothly.”
According to the employees of Metro Cinema, where MNS workers had tried to enter while shouting slogans last week, there is sufficient security in case the situation turns ugly. “We direct such people to our manager’s office,” said guard Archana Damodar. She was the one who took 12 MNS workers and their letter to the manager before the group was eventually arrested.
Another guard at Metro, Rejendra Awhad, recalled the release of Gadar, starring Sunny Deol and Amisha Patel, in 2001 when similar tension was witnessed. “There were protests to stop release of the film even then,” he said.
According to the Mumbai Police, security has been extended to malls and multiplexes and single-screen theatres to ensure smooth release of the ADHM. “We have already taken action against 12 MNS members who protested outside Metro Cinema. If we find anyone creating ruckus and stopping the screening of the movie, we will take action against both the footsoldiers who protest and the leaders who provoke them,” said an official.
With this, Multiplex cinemas are assured of hassle-free release of the film Friday. “The advance bookings have already begun. The matter is sorted now,” said Gaurav Gupta, attached with Carnival Cinemas that has 11 theaters in Mumbai and 190 in India. According to him, the box-office collection will be much bigger since it is a festive season. “We can see the situation is calm now,” he added.
There have also been queries on whether Pakistani artistes were working on tourists visas. “Complaints on Pakistani artistes working on illegal visas were probed but in none of the cases we found them violating visa conditions. Those who were probed have been found to be holding working visas,” said a police officer.

THE IRE against Pakistani actors has touched the Jio MAMI 18th Mumbai Film Festival, which is to showcase a Pakistani film called The Day Shall Dawn. Saying that the organisers will “flare outrage” among people after the Uri attack, city-based NGO Sangharsh has approached the police to protest against the screening of the film.
According to senior officials at Amboli police station, the organisers of MAMI and members of Sangarsh NGO will be called on Monday for questioning to understand the validity of the NGO’s complaint.

“We have received the complaint. No FIR has been registered yet,” a senior officer from the Amboli police station said.
The letter by the NGO president Prithvi Mhaske to the police said: “The organisers of this event are likely to flare outrage among people by telecasting this Pakistani film in the festival. This will just not be acceptable as it will give rise to more civil tension and outrage among people.”
The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has been pressing for a ban on Pakistani artistes in India in the wake of the Uri attack, which killed 18 Indian soldiers.
According to the NGO, even single-screen theatres have decided against showcasing films with Pakistani actors. “So, why are the organisers of MAMI pouring so much love towards Pakistani actors,” the letter said.
The 18th edition of the festival will be held between October 20 and October 27 and will show 180 movies from 54 countries across theatres in Mumbai.
The NGO has sought police permission to hold a protest against MAMI organisers in Andheri West on October 20.
Ironically, The Day Shall Dawn is a story set in East Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, and was shot entirely in Bangladesh.
It was made in 1959 by director A J Kardar and was even sent as a nomination for the 1960 Academy Awards. The movie essayed the daily struggles of fishermen in a village, and had narratives of their struggles with loan sharks. The movie is based on an original story written by Manik Bandopadhyay.
A wikipedia page on the movie says the movie faced political boycott even during the time of its release, with the government of Pakistan asking the movie’s producer Nauman Taseer not to show it as it was perceived as a communist movie, besides being from Bangladesh, soon after the partition.
Meanwhile, the Indian Motions Pictures Producers Association (IMPAA) recently met MNS members to request they do not press for ban of two films, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Fawad Khan and Raees starring Mahira Khan. The IMPAA also assured them of not casting Pakistani artistes in the future."

Addressing a rally in Kozhikode, Kerala, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, challenged the people of Pakistan to fight a battle against India. In the challenge, the PM deviated from the conventional ideas of war and asked Pakistan to declare war against poverty, illiteracy and unemployment in their country. The PM added that both the countries should compete and fight the obstacles in their own homeland and each should strive to emerge a winner in that battle.

Oscar winning music composer AR Rahman says he didn’t want his first production, 99 Songs, to face any problem so he advised its director against casting a Pakistani actor for the lead role.
Rahman has also written the film, which is directed by debutante Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy and features Ehan Bhat in his acting debut.
At the film’s music launch on Thursday, Rahman revealed he was taken aback when Vishwesh shortlisted three Pakistani actor-musicians a nd warned him to not go for the said actors because he was afraid “What if something happened between India and Pakistan.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The music maestro added his reluctance to cast a Pakistani actor existed even before artistes from the neighbouring country faced a boycott by the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association following the Uri attack in 2016.

“We were looking for a hero who could sing, act and who was charming. So, we were scanning everything and our friend (director) goes to Pakistan and he picks up three guys from Pakistan and I said, ‘Why can’t you find any boy in India who can sing?’
“He said, ‘No sir, this guy can sing and he plays very well.’ I said what if something happens? This was before all the trouble happened. I said, ‘This is my first movie, don’t make problem for me.’ The exact same thing happened, no? I’m so glad… then we went back to audition again,” Rahman told reporters here.

Vishwesh said he wasn’t necessarily looking to cast Pakistani actors but it so happened that he wasn’t able to find any performer in India who could act and sing.
“Usually what happens is even when you go to a store, you first check the quality of the product. Later you see where it’s been manufactured – Made in Indonesia, Made in China, Made in India… What we were looking for was a musician and the ones that seemed to have a Hindi diction and could play instruments just happened to not be from India.

“But it’s not like we made a decision to only pick actors from Pakistan, they just happened to be from there. But at the end of it, I think Ehan more than made up for all of our initial choices. I have to say that he really grew into his role,” he said.

As the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena vowed to ratchet up its campaign to intimidate and vandalise cinema halls against the screening of Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (ADHM) featuring Pakistan actor Fawad Khan, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Wednesday sought to send out a message that the state would firmly deal with the protests.
“The police have taken strict action against MNS today. Twelve members of the MNS who had gone to Metro Theatre to threaten them have been sent to judicial custody until November 4,” Fadnavis told The Indian Express. He indicated that while everyone had a right to protest, any action which disrupts law and order would not be allowed.
His remarks came a day after film-maker Karan Johar issued a video statement that he would not “engage talent from neighbouring country given the circumstances,”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
READ | Open letter to Karan Johar: I’m sad that you surrendered your freedom of expression
A group of 12 MNS party workers tried to enter Metro theatre in south Mumbai this morning and asked the management not to screen the Karan Johar film. They were arrested by the Azad Maidan police station under Sections of the Bombay Police Act and were granted bail but will remain in detention until November 4.
Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Ashok Dudhe said the police invoked Section 151 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code that allows them to secure detention of the accused on the suspicion that they could create trouble when released and their being “at large is prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.”

Under this, the officer can request the court to keep the accused detained for a period not exceeding 15 days. So while the arrested MNS men were granted bail of Rs 5000 each, they will remain in detention until November 4 when their bail bonds will be executed.
Said MNS cine wing head Amey Khopkar: “Our protests will continue against the screening of the movie in theatres.”
The producers of the movie had earlier met Mumbai Police Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar seeking security for cinema-hall owners. The Mumbai Police assured the producers that they would provide security for the screening of the movie scheduled to be released October 28.

The government’s action comes when it is under attack from the Opposition. Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said that the government had abdicated its responsibility with the state being shown up as weak in the face of threats by the MNS. “These goons have to be put behind bars,” he said.
Film-maker Kundan Shah, who directed the cult film Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, said that he was saddened by the call to ban Pakistani artists in India. “Calling it ‘intolerance’ would be evading the larger question. The question to be asked is ‘How can we stop the bullets?’ But no one wants to ask this fundamental question,” he said.
Last year, Shah had returned his National Award to protest against what he called was “rising intolerance” and the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as head of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). “Trade has not stopped between India and Pakistan and the borders have not stopped exchanging goods. Then why should the artists be banned?” he said.
Meanwhile, a day after Johar appealed to let ADHM be released citing the “blood, sweat and tears,” of “over 300 Indian people” in his crew, two more exhibitors’ associations said that they would not release the movie this Diwali. The Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) received letters from the Central Cine Circuit Association (CCC) and the Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal, said COEAI president Nitin Datar.
“The single screens and multiplexes under these two associations have promised to not release the film this Diwali,” said Datar.
The Marathi Mahamandal is the key organisation for theatres in the state which showcases Marathi cinema and, occasionally, major Bollywood releases. Its area of influence includes Vidarbha and Marathwada. And the CCC covers parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. According to Datar, the decision will impact close to 200 screens.
On October 14, COEAI had called for a ban on ADHM telling its members to not release the film in their theatres. The decision came after the MNS threatened to cause damage to theatres which screen the film.

The film has been at the centre of controversy after ties between India and Pakistan soured in the wake of the Uri attack and the subsequent surgical strike by the Army."

(Illustration by C R Sasikumar)
As the events set in motion by the Pulwama attack wind down, one point, always present in India-Pakistan relations, bears reiteration. The relationship relates not only to India’s external interests and foreign policy but also, in almost equal measure, to the country’s politics and social equations. That explains, perhaps, the absence of serious discussion on the Pakistani reality, the prevalence of entrenched reflexes of the political and security classes and the media projection of the complex relationship as a mixture of a high decibel gladiatorial contest and a raucous tamasha.
All this was on display in the weeks after the Pulwama attack and distracted attention from what in the aftermath of the attack should have been the national focus — how to end Pakistan’s terrorism, which has continued for almost three decades. Instead, popular attention by itself, and intensified by the media, was on the politics over the entire sequence — Pulwama, the Balakot response and the Pakistani counter. It was also on the grieving families of the victims of Pulwama and the capture and return of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. It was right for the nation to share the grief of the families and rejoice in Abhinandan’s return and for the media to report but not at the cost of the root of the problem.
The post-Uri attack surgical strikes had marked a major shift in India’s response to Pakistani terror. India had then announced that it had taken the military action in Pakistan-controlled territory but had emphasised that it had targeted only terrorist launch pads. The surgical strikes were undertaken in a manner that provided Pakistan an opportunity to deny them and therefore, foreclose the possibility of escalation though at the cost of an erosion of its nuclear overhang doctrine.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Balakot action was designed to send a much stronger signal of the Indian resolve to not refrain from acting militarily on Pakistani sovereign territory in the wake of an unacceptable terrorist attack. At the same time, as after the surgical strikes, India went to great lengths to stress that it had only targeted a terrorist facility. Have the surgical strikes and the Balakot action set a new criterion which no government will be able to avoid notwithstanding the Pakistani counter? How will these impact India’s anti-terror approach?
In the past, the preferred Indian approach was defensive; it absorbed terror and relied on diplomacy and political management to cool outraged Indian sentiment. It took solace in the assessment that Pakistani terror did not constitute a strategic challenge. There is now a break from the past but there is no clarity if the new approach is fixed. There is need to look at its full contours and implications. What is certain is that Pakistan and the international community will have to factor in their calculations India’s willingness to bring its conventional forces into play in the wake of an unacceptable terrorist attack.
Till now Pakistan had sought to paralyse the possibility of an Indian conventional military force reaction after a terrorist incident through its nuclear overhang threat. Now it will have to think anew especially as the international community knows that Pakistan does harbour terrorist groups that act against India with or without state involvement. It is unlikely though that Pakistan will give up the use of terror. Hence, if India wants its end, it will have to consider it as a strategic challenge and use all elements of national power in a sustained manner over a long period.
Isolated steps such as the withdrawal of the MFN status, denial of visas to sports teams and the decision to use all the waters of the eastern rivers under the Indus Waters Treaty — even if feasible — are toothless. They may contribute to bringing down Indian anger but will be ineffective in moderating Pakistani thinking or action. Will the resumption of a comprehensive dialogue as Pakistan wants and emphasised again and again by Prime Minister Imran Khan influence Pakistan to abandon terror?
The Composite Dialogue to promote cooperation, address outstanding issues and handle humanitarian concerns was begun in 1998. Soon after this author told a prominent Pakistani politician, who has always professed a commitment to India-Pakistan peace, that as the two countries had embarked on a serious and comprehensive engagement, Pakistan should give up its support of terrorist groups acting against India. His reply “Agar hum yeh band kar dein toh aap hamse baat kyon karenge”? (If we were to stop this why would you talk to us?)
Has this Pakistani premise changed during the course of the last two decades? Every time India resumed talks after a terror strike, though after a hiatus, the view expressed by the Pakistani politician has been reinforced.
India has to insist that unless terror ends, the resumption of the dialogue will be pointless. This is an entirely reasonable proposition and should be projected to the international community. It is noteworthy that except for a muted Chinese statement that sovereignty should be respected, no country has criticised the Balakot action. There is therefore a recognition that India’s strategic patience is over and that Pakistani terrorist adventurism should cease. India should emphasise this point. The international desire that hostilities should end is on a different footing as is the US’s intervention for this purpose. The question is if all this erodes India’s policy of no involvement of third parties in India-Pakistan relations. The fact is major powers take an interest in issues of war and peace — as does India in areas where its interests get involved.
Pulwama, Balakot, the Pakistani counter, Abhinandan’s quick return will undoubtedly become election issues. The BJP will seek to cash in on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decisiveness and how Pakistan was taught a lesson. The Opposition will try to deny him this advantage. In the shrillness that will ensue, a serious consideration of India’s Pakistan policy will have to await another day. But will that day ever dawn?"

Forensic experts have established that the terrorists who attacked the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri began their journey at a base in Pakistan, highly-placed sources familiar with the investigation have told The Indian Express.
The findings, the sources said, are based on digital data recovered from a severely-damaged Global Positioning System (GPS) unit recovered from the terrorists after the September 18 fighting that claimed their lives.

https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The data, recovered from the Garmin eTrex GPS unit carried by the terrorists, show the men travelled by road along the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar road towards the Line of Control on September 17, before beginning to hike into the mountains short of Chakothi, the official border point.
Following their penetration of the Line of Control south of Chakothi on the night of September 17, the men continued to walk eastward, traversing three ridgelines before climbing towards the village of Darah Goolan. They rested there before assaulting the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in the bowl below.
“It’s clear from the timeline of the terrorists’ movements, which we now have, that they were able to penetrate the three-tier defences on the Line of Control with relative ease, and evade Army patrols deeper inside Kashmir as well,” a source familiar with the case said. “This is an obvious source of concern.”
From data recorded on the set, investigators have determined it was first powered-up on September 4, a fortnight before the attack, at a known Lashkar-e-Taiba facility in the Leepa Valley — one of the areas later targeted by the Indian Army in the cross-Line of Control strikes in retaliation for Uri.
There has been no official investigation into how the four attackers succeeded in penetrating the Line of Control defences to cause the Indian Army’s worst single loss in the insurgency in Kashmir, but military sources said it is believed they used ladders to scale the barbed-wire fence.
GPS sets, which have a wide range of commercial applications, rely on radiowave signals from a network of satellites to guide users through unfamiliar terrain. The terrorists who attacked Uri were carrying two sets, but one was too badly damaged during the fighting for data to be recovered.
Last month, the Lashkar-e-Taiba admitted responsibility for the attack, naming one of the four terrorists involved in the operation as Muhammad Anas, who operated under the alias Abu Siraqa.
Posters that the organisation put up in his home town, Gujranwala, invited townspeople to join funeral prayers for “lion-hearted holy warrior Abu Siraqa Muhammad Anas, who sent 177 Hindu soldiers to hell at the Uri Brigade camp… and thus drank from the glass of martyrdom”.
National Investigation Agency detectives had also recovered syringes, painkillers, other medications and packets of ready-to-eat food bearing markings of Pakistani manufacturers from the terrorists killed in the operation.
Pakistan is yet to initiate criminal proceedings against either members of the organisation, or individuals involved in planning the operation.
In September, responding to a question, Pakistan Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said “when Indians themselves have no proof, then what kind of action can Pakistan take? They have only levelled an accusation, and that too only to defame Pakistan”.
Indian government sources said that no information has emerged to corroborate claims that two Pakistani men who were later arrested were linked to the attack. The claims had formed the basis of a dossier handed over to Pakistan, asking for follow-up investigation by that country into the Uri attacks.
Faisal Husain Awan, a resident of Halka 4 in Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote, and Ahsan Khursheed, of Mohalla Kidri in the village of Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil, had been held on suspicion of aiding the four terrorists, involved in the Uri attack, cross the Line of Control.
Government sources said the two men, both students, are now believed to have strayed across, not an uncommon feature in the Uri area where populations reside close to the Line of Control. “No evidence has emerged so far that the men knew the attackers,” an official said."

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find a “firm” solution to the “thorny” fishermen issue. The Lankan President made the demand during a meeting with Modi where the two leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation in a whole host of areas, including energy and health. There was a discussion on the thorny issue of fishermen. President Sirisena said he wanted a firm solution on the issue. Modi agreed with him and said “we must find a proper solution to this long festering issue,” MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said after the meeting held ahead of the BRICS-Bimstec Outreach Summit.

“As you know we have invited the Sri Lankan fisheries minister to India and we hope at that time, the discussions would lead to some kind of mutually acceptable outcome,” Swarup said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The PM briefed Sirisena on the Uri terror attack. “He noted the support Sri Lanka had provided to India, and expressed his gratitude to people and government of Sri Lanka,” he said.
“Modi said that as a result of the solidarity that the countries of the region had shown after the Uri terror attacks, a message had gone across that people in our region want peace and they recognise that the biggest challenge to peace and prosperity is terrorism,” Swarup said. Sirisena said Sri Lanka opposed all forms and manifestations of terrorism, he said. The two leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation in a whole host of areas like energy and health. “Modi welcomed Sirisena to India and thanked him for accepting the invitation to participate in the Summit,” he said.
Sirisena said “this is another occasion when the bonds  between Sri Lanka and India are further strengthened”. “He also alluded to the long standing relations between the two countries,” Swarup added.
The two leaders reviewed the development cooperation and partnership between India and Sri Lanka, Swarup said. The Lankan leader thanked Modi for gifting ambulances to western and southern provinces and hoped this will be extended to other areas as well, Swarup said. “He briefed Modi on progress in rehabilitation projects in the northern province,” he said. Modi later met the Bhutanese PM Tshering Tobgay, the MEA spokesperson said."

Skirting direct reference to Pakistan and JeM, China today voiced concern over “escalation” of tensions and “rising temperatures” in Kashmir after the Uri terror attack and called on India and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue. “We have noted relevant reports. We are shocked by this attack,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told media briefing here when asked about Beijing’s reaction to yesterday’s Uri attack and India’s charge that Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) is behind it.
JeM has special significance as Beijing has put a technical hold over India’s efforts to bring about a UN ban on the outfit’s leader Masood Azhar for his involvement in Pathankot attack. Referring to the Uri attack in which 18 soldiers were killed and several injured, Lu said “we want to express our deep sympathies and condolences to the affected families and the injured”. “China opposes and strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. We are concerned about this escalation and rising temperatures surrounding Kashmir situation,” he said. “We hope relevant parties will have dialogue and consultation to resolve their differences and enhance counter terrorism cooperation,” Lu said, without directly referring to India and Pakistan.

“Only this way can they safeguard peace and security in their region,” he said. Lu also voiced concern over the fallout of the Uri attack on the USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) being laid through the PoK and said the project, in which China is investing considerable amount of resources, needs concerted efforts from all countries for its success. Asked how China sees the impact of the escalation of violence on the CPEC, Lu said: “The building of the corridor is to drive the development of the regional countries. It needs the concerted efforts of all countries concerned to ensure the smooth running of this corridor.” “At the same time I need to stress that recently in this region, especially in Kashmir region, there has been some escalation of tensions,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Our position is that we hope all relevant parties can work together and remain committed to resolving these disputes through peaceful consultations and jointly maintain the peace and stability of the region. “This in final analysis is conducive and will bring benefits to China, India, Pakistan and all the regional countries,” he said. China’s concerns over the fall out of the recurring violence in the region was highlighted by state-run Global Times which on September 13 said “China may not want to put too much focus on the region. At the very least, it would be unwise to put all its eggs in one basket”.
“The CPEC has long been seen as symbolic of Sino-Pakistan economic cooperation. It is unlikely that China will change its supportive attitude on the CPEC in the short term, but the increasing cost of security is becoming a big problem in efficiently pushing forward the projects,” the article said."

The Indian Army conducted an overnight surgical strikes along the Line of Control in Pakistan on Thursday. The surgical strikes targeted seven terror launch pads across using heliborne and ground forces. Addressing a press conference, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said India inflicted “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them. Several Indian leaders, across party lines have since hailed the Army for successfully executing surgical strikes and backed the Modi government’s decision as a befitting retaliation to Pakistan.
Here’s a quick guide on the entire operation:
What: India confirmed that surgical strikes were conducted along the LoC to safeguard our nation on Thursday. “Significant casualties have been caused to terrorists and those trying to shield them. We don’t have a plan to further conduct such strikes. India has spoken to Pakistan,” DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said.

Pakistan, however, has dismissed India’s claim of surgical strike and has termed it as a “quest” by India to create media hype by re-branding cross-border fire, that killed their two soldiers, as a surgical strike. In a statement, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday said, “The Pakistani Army gave befitting response to the Indian army. Indian Army opened up small arm fire last night on five sectors across LoC. India is doing this under a well-planned objective. If India tries to do this again, we will respond forcefully. India is doing this only to please their media and public.” Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and said, “Strongly condemned the unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces resulting in martyrdom of two Pakistan soldiers along LoC.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

When: Indian news agencies reported that the strikes were conducted between 12:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m, Thursday. According to a statement released by Pakistan’s Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the firing started around 2.30 am and continued well after dawn till 8.00 am on Thursday.
Where: The seven terror launch pads were located between 500 meters to three kilometres across the LoC in Pakistan. An ISPR statement said, town of Bhimber, Hotspring Kel and Lipa sectors in Pakistan were attacked.
Why: Thursday’s attacks were the latest in the offensives launched by India since the Uri attack. On September 18, four men executed what was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the Indian Army and killed 19 army jawans in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri in the rear office of an Indian Army infantry installation. The attackers are believed to have come from Pakistan. Since then, India has upped its diplomatic offensive against Pakistan in a bid to isolate the country internationally.

Causalities: The Defence Ministry confirmed that there were no causalities on the Indian side. The Pakistan side has accepted that two soldiers were killed in the early morning firing. There are some reports that upto 40 terrorists were killed in the strikes across multiple launchpads. However, the Indian defence apparatus has not yet authenticated any of these reports."

China has blocked a tributary of the Brahmaputra river in Tibet as part of the construction of its “most expensive” hydro project which could cause concern in India as it may impact water flows into the lower riparian countries.
The Lalho project on Xiabuqu river, a tributary of Yarlung Zangbo (the Tibetan name for Brahmaputra), in Xigaze in Tibet involves an investment of 4.95 billion yuan (USD 740 million), Zhang Yunbao, head of the project’s administration bureau was quoted as saying by Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency on Saturday.

https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Xigaze also known as Shigatse is closely located to Sikkim. From Xigaze, the Brahmaputra flows into Arunachal Pradesh.
Terming it as the “most expensive project”, the report said the project, whose construction began in June 2014, was scheduled to be completed in 2019.
It is not clear yet what impact the blockade of the river will have on the flow of water from the Brahmaputra into the lower riparian countries like India and Bangladesh as a result, it said.
Last year, China had operationalised the USD 1.5 billion Zam Hydropower Station, the largest in Tibet, built on the Brahmaputra river, which has raised concerns in India.
But China has been maintaining that it has taken into consideration India’s concerns and allays apprehensions of restricting the flow of water, saying its dams are run of the river projects not designed to hold water.
The outline of China’s 12th Five Year Plan indicates that three more hydropower projects on the mainstream of the Brahmaputra river in Tibet Autonomous Region have been approved for implementation.
In March, Union Minister of State for Water Resources Sanwar Lal Jat said in a statement that India had expressed its concerns to China about the likely impact of the dams.
While there is no water treaty between the countries, India and China established an Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) on trans-border rivers and in October 2013 the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding on strengthening cooperation on trans-border rivers under which Beijing provides data to India on the water flows.
The blockade of the Brahmaputra river tributary comes at a time when India’s reported decision to suspend talks with Pakistan under Indus Water Treaty as part of its efforts to hit back at Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang gave a guarded reply when asked on September 27 about India’s reported move.
“As a friendly neighbour to both India and Pakistan, China hopes that India and Pakistan can properly address disputes and improve relations through dialogue and consultation, maintain and enhance all-round cooperation and join hands to promote regional peace, stability and development,” Shuang told media. Some of the rivers under the Indus water treaty originate in China."

Vicky Kaushal is looking forward to the release of his next film Uri. The Aditya Dhar directorial is based on Indian Army’s surgical strikes in retaliation to Pakistan’s attack on Uri. And while we know Vicky put in a lot of hard work, including beefing up his physique and undergoing military training for hours every day, the Manmarziyaan actor has now shared a sneak peek into how he is dubbing for the film.
Vicky plays an Indian commando in Uri. In a video the actor shared on his Instagram account, we can see him dubbing for a scene from Uri, which looks like a combat sequence. From loud facial expressions to animated body movement, the dubbing session surely looks intense yet a bit comical too.
Vicky Kaushal captioned the video as, “Dubbing for an action sequence can sometimes be quite a comical scene… actually always! #bts #URI …Trailer coming out soon 👊🏽”

Vicky had recently shared with indianexpress.com how he always wanted to do an action film. “Uri got wrapped up in three months. We were training for four months before that, physical and military training. For me, it was a journey of some nine months, in which I did so many things I had never done before, be it putting on some weight to getting a physique, the action training. This is my out-and-out action film where I am unleashing a lot of punches. So this was a genre I was really looking forward to. That happened. It is a real-life story based on the Uri attacks and the following surgical strikes. I’m playing a soldier. So it was very new for me.”

India and Singapore have vowed to fight terrorism and “all those” who encourage, support and finance it, asserting there can be no justification for terror acts.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong recognised that “terrorism continues to remain the single most significant threat to peace and stability”, a joint statement issued during Lee’s India visit said on Thursday.

https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It said during their talks on Tuesday, the two leaders reiterated their “strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stressed that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever”.
Lee expressed his condolences to the Indian government and the families of the victims of the Uri attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed, and stated that Singapore strongly condemns terrorist attacks of all forms.
“The two Prime Ministers affirmed their resolve to fight against global terrorism, terror organisations and networks and all those who encourage, support and finance them. They called for reinvigorating multilateral action on terrorism, including through the finalisation and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations at the earliest,” the statement said.
During Lee’s five-day visit that will conclude on Friday, three MoUs were also signed between Singapore and India –including one dealing with Intellectual Property rights to facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations.
Modi and Lee expressed satisfaction at the ongoing cooperation to address common security concerns, such as in the areas of counter-terrorism, maritime security, cyber security and illicit drug trafficking.
The two Prime Ministers recognised the importance of further strengthening economic cooperation between India and Singapore and the many complementaries and opportunities that exist between the two countries.
In this regard, they noted the holding of meetings by the Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment and the Financial Dialogue Preparatory Meeting as important initiatives as envisaged under the India-Singapore Strategic Partnership.
Modi welcomed the listing of Masala Bonds on the Singapore Exchange and briefed Lee about the efforts made to boost investments into India in the field of infrastructure development.
Modi and Lee held “wide-ranging discussions on bilateral, regional and multilateral issues in a warm, cordial and friendly atmosphere, reflecting the excellent bilateral ties,” the statement said.
Lee reaffirmed Singapore’s continuing support for India’s bid to become a permanent member in a reformed United Nations Security Council."

The Shiv Sena has consciously decided not to join the anti-Pakistan chorus against actors cast in Bollywood films to avoid what party sources said unnecessary competition with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). It also reckons that violence on the streets fuelled by anti-Pakistan sentiments will not auger well for the party, which shares power with the BJP both at the Centre and the state.
The MNS led by Raj Thackeray has taken the centrestage by voicing its protests against Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. The question that is being asked is, has the MNS succeeded in hijacking the “anti-Pak” agenda of the Sena?
“Our anti-Pakistan stand has always been based on patriotism. The MNS’s anti-Pakistan protest is for politics,” said Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant. “Moreover, our anti-Pakistan stand is known for the past six decades,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

It was in September when MNS’s cine wing chief Amey Khopar issued an ultimatum to film producers, directors and theatre associations against casting and screening films with Pakistani actors.
The marked difference in the nature of protest between the Sena and MNS has been evident from Day One. While the MNS has resorted to protests, the Sena vents its anger against Pakistan in the in-house mouthpiece Saamana.
The Sena’s moderate stand on Pakistan is a clear departure from its past when Sainiks would dig up cricket pitches to stop matches with Pakistan and disallowed ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali’s concert in Mumbai. The list of Sena protests against cultural and sports events involving Pakistanis runs long.
“We are looking at the Pakistan problems in larger national and international context. Being a party in power in the NDA at the Centre, our concern was the Indian government should give a befitting reply to Pakistan after the Uri attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves appreciation for the surgical strikes across the Line of Control,” said a Sena Cabinet minister.
He said the surgical strikes sent a clear and loud message to Pakistan and the world. “Therefore, taking on individual actors as is being done by some section (MNS) is fine. Why engage in ugly competition with the MNS,” he said.
Earlier, in an editorial in Saamana after the Uri attack, the Sena said, “It’s time PM keeps his promise to teach Pakistan a lesson.” In another editorial, it had said, “Pakistan is a terrorist state. Why should efforts be made to declare it a terror state? The whole world knows Pakistan’s true colours.”
Instead, the Sena is concentrating on larger issues where it can score against the BJP, such as the local bodies’ elections.
On its part, the MNS is increasingly scouting for emotive issues to revive the organisation. The protest against Pakistani actors coinciding with the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has landed them that political space. But to what extent it would help them electorally remains to be seen.
MNS general secretary Shalini Thackeray said, “We will not compromise on films with Pakistani actors. We will continue our protest.”"

Bollywood actors Anil Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Kajol have welcomed Pakistani cinema owners’ decision to end the long ban on Bollywood films. Cinema owners in the neighbouring country will allow screenings of Indian films again, months after ban was imposed in the aftermath of Uri attacks in September.

 
Happy with the development, Priyanka said, “Art should go across the world. I have always believed that. So, I am glad about it.” Kajol added that she is happy that it is a great sign for the film industry. “Anything where the film industry gets a brick, where the film industry gets a positive sign etc, I am all for the film industry,” she said.
Anil also expressed his happiness over the decision. “I am very happy about it, it is a great news,” the veteran said. They were speaking at the Sansui Colors Stardust awards last night. The ban came after there was a demand on the boycott of Pakistani artists from Indian films. Pakistani cinema owners said that this step was a move towards restoring peace between the two nations. They also admitted that financial concerns also motivated the decision as cinema owners suffered losses.
Priyanka Chopra who returned to India for her brand commitments and other assignments looked happy and cheerful as always. She said that it was her sheer hard work that fetched her all the success that she had been able to achieve."

Pakistani Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday said there were reports that back-door diplomacy efforts have started between Pakistan and India to normalise relations between the two neighbouring countries. The Pakistan Peoples Party leader was speaking to Geo News and said that Pakistan-India tensions could lead to instability in the world.
She said that both Pakistan and India are atomic powers and the region cannot afford a war.
She said that Track-II diplomacy consists of mutual steps taken for the sake of peace by mutual friends and it does not take place at governmental level.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

She added that India should make the first move to ease the persisting tension.
“India following the Uri attack started taking aggressive measures,” Geo News quoted Sherry Rehman as saying. She said that India should have investigation of the Uri attack on an international level.
Sherry Rehman said that India and Pakistan should solve their mutual disputes through political measures. She said that world powers are also trying to normalise India-Pak relations.
Following the attack on an army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir that killed 18 Indian soldiers, Indian government stepped up its efforts to isolate Pakistan on the issue of exporting terror.

Condemnations continued to pour in against the Uri attack with France calling on every State to fight effectively against terrorist groups operating from its territory against other countries.
France also recalls the importance it attaches to bringing calm and the peaceful settlement of disputes in the region of Kashmir, a French Foreign Ministry statement said.
“France most firmly condemns the terrible terrorist attack perpetrated on 18 September against an Indian army camp in the region of Kashmir. It conveys its condolences to the families of the 17 Indian soldiers killed in this attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“France remains at India’s side in the combat against terrorism. It calls on every State to fight effectively against terrorist groups operating on their territory or from their territory against other countries,” it said.

Condemning the militant attack on an army camp in North Kashmir’s Uri town that killed 17 soldiers, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hoped the perpetrators of the crime would be brought to justice and re-establishing stability and preventing any further loss of life will be the priority of “all involved”.
“The United Nations is following developments closely and shares the concerns of people living in the region for peace,” a statement issued by Ban’s spokesperson in New York said.
Ban expressed hope that the perpetrators of the attack would be brought to justice and all stakeholders would meet their responsibilities to maintain peace and stability."

While some are hailing Fawad Khan for his Facebook post on terror and ban on Pakistani artistes in Bollywood, a lot of Facebook users are blaming the Pakistani heartthrob for being too diplomatic and failing to take a stand. After a long silence on the issue which affects him directly, the Pakistani actor had yesterday hoped for peace.

While a user called it “elegant diplomacy,” another wrote, “stop acting innocent! People in India loved you always, supported you even when half the population stood against you,and what you did? You betrayed them by acting innocent in India and just when you reached the pakistani border your statements changed.” There were a few who backed Fawad too.
Fawad’s statement came on a day a movie body requested MNS not to hinder the release of films starring Pakistani actors, the most prominent being Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Fawad. Ajay Devgn, whose Shivaay will clash with Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, also said that he will not star with Pakistani actors in the present climate.
In his official Facebook post, Fawad wrote, “I’ve been in Lahore since July as my wife and I had been expecting our second child. I’ve received numerous requests from the media and from well wishers worldwide asking me for my thoughts on the sad incidents that took place in the past few weeks. As a father of two little children, I pray and wish like many others that together we can build and live in a more peaceful world. I believe we owe it to our children who will shape our tomorrow.

Fawad’s statement comes a day after two other Pakistan artistes — singer Shafqat Amanat Ali and actor Mawra Hocane, condemned the Uri attacks and showed concern over the rising terror strikes on the border.

LAUDING THE armed forces and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “surgical strikes”, BJP leaders on Wednesday were excited, but maintained that it was a preemptive strike for defence in an area “where India has every right to defend.”
On the ground, the party assesses that the strikes in the early hours of Thursday would not only boost Modi’s image as a leader who “walked the talk” and “punished” Pakistan for the September 18 attack in Uri but also help the BJP gain an upper hand in the upcoming state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Echoing the overall optimism among party leaders, BJP president Amit Shah said the strikes indicated the rise of a “new India”, as the country has given a “clear response” to militants. “The Army launched a successful surgical strike and damaged terrorists in a big way without suffering any casualty. This is proof of our Army’s bravery, capacity and patriotism. In this long war against terrorism, a clear response has been given to terrorists by destroying their breeding centre for the first time,” Shah said in a statement.
Praising Modi’s leadership, the BJP chief said in multiple tweets, “It is for the first time (that) in this frontal fight against terrorism, India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Modi, is feeling secure…. Today’s strikes signal the rise of a new India where the GoI (Government of India) doesn’t get cowed down by nefarious designs of terrorists.”
Having sought the “complete jaw for a tooth” in a tweet immediately after the Uri attack, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav today posted on social media, “PM Modi-ji has walked the talk. Punishing the perpetrators of terror from across has begun.”

While Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called the strikes an “example of India’s commitment and firm willpower to fight against terrorism from across the border,” Minister of State Rajyavardhan Rathore said India committed no territorial violation since PoK is a part of India.
The party’s spokespersons gave credit to the Army, but insisted that it was Modi’s strong political will that led the armed forces to take this step. BJP national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh said, “A salute to the armed forces and to the leadership of the PM for securing our borders and defending from Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. A responsible government acts (more) and talks less — and that has been the practice of this government under Modi’s leadership.”
Both Singh and Shrikant Sharma, also a BJP national secretary, pointed out that the “surgical strikes”, and the “diplomatic” efforts that preceded them to isolate Pakistan globally, are Modi’s successes. “It is the capital the Prime Minister has achieved in the international bank that made many countries, including Bangladesh and Iran, stand by us,” Singh said.
Sharma said, “The BJP government wants terrorism to be stopped and the Prime Minister has the political will to take action.” But emphasising that there is no politics involved in national security, he added, “Prime Minister Modi has been taking all parties along when it comes to nation’s development and its security.”
Hitting back at critics, another BJP leader said the “surgical strikes” are a “response to those who criticised the Modi government, and the party, for its policies on Pakistan, as well as the government’s diplomatic efforts…. We have been ridiculed by critics… and faced harsh criticism on the government’s ability to retaliate. This will be the response.”
According to BJP sources, the party’s top leadership realised that the Uri terror attack would adversely affect its prospects in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab elections, due early next year, unless there was some kind of a retaliation. “The party, and the government, was caught in between. There were practical difficulties and international obligations that came in the way of a retaliation, but there were more serious apprehensions — of the armed forces losing morale, and the diminishing prospects of the BJP if the government did hit back,” a party leader said."

The four Pakistani terrorists, who killed 19 soldiers in one of the the bloodiest attacks on an army camp in Uri last month, had used a ladder to scale the electrified fence at the LoC. Investigation carried out by the army to identify the infiltration route of the four terrorists led it to conclude that a ladder was used near Salamabad nallah, official sources said. The army officials said that one of the four, who mounted the brazen attack in Uri, about 102 km from Srinagar, had infiltrated using the gaps along the fence near Salamabad nallah and erected a ladder on the Indian side of the fence, while the other three had a ladder on their side. The two ladders were connected like a pedestrian bridge.
Watch what else is making news

The sources said it was difficult for all the four to infiltrate through the gap used by the first terrorist as each one of them was carrying heavy rucksacks filled with ammunition, weapons and eatables. It would have taken them a lot of time to cross the fence at grave risk to their lives as army teams, which routinely patrol the area, could have spotted them. After the four infiltrated into India, the ladder, carried by the first terrorist, was handed over back to the two guides — Mohd Kabir Awan and Basharat– who accompanied them up to the LoC, sources said, adding it was done to ensure there were no tell-tale signs.
The army is conducting an enquiry at Gohallan and adjoining village Jablah as they suspect the terrorists might have taken shelter there for a day before launching the deadly attack on September 18 which left 19 army personnel dead and a large quantity of arms and ammunition destroyed. The first incident of terrorists using ladders to cross the fence was reported in Machil sector of North Kashmir earlier this year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The army has launched an internal inquiry into the incident and removed Uri Brigade commander K Soma Shanker. Preliminary investigations suggested the terrorists had entered the area at least a day before mounting the brazen assault. The inquiry, which will be completed in a time-bound manner, will also suggest measures to prevent such attacks in future. Pakistan-based groups were now indulging more in “shallow infiltration” during which the terrorists, after crossing the LoC, target the first available army camp or security establishment.
During the investigation it was found that the terrorists had sneaked into the army camp by cutting the perimeter fencing of the highly-guarded installation at one place. In an indication that the terrorists were well aware of the layout of the base close to the LoC, the assailants had locked the kitchen and store from outside to prevent the soldiers present inside from leaving before setting the structures on fire, they said.
The investigators also said the four terrorists might have sneaked in from PoK on the intervening night of September 16/17 and stayed put at village Sukhdar, overlooking the Brigade headquarter. Sukhdar village is located at a vantage point allowing an unhindered view of the army base and movement of personnel inside it."

Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Bombay) had on September 26 organised a candle march to pay tribute to the martyred soldiers in Uri attack in the Institute campus at 6:30 pm.
The students paid reverence to the sacrifice made by the soldiers. One of the teachers said that terrorists use technology for their nefarious acts and this can be countered if the research fellows and the scientists use their expertise.
The students and faculty condemned the Uri attack and called it an act of cowardice. “It is a grave loss for the nation. Their memory will remain etched in our hearts and minds,” said a student.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The students prayed and conveyed condolences to the bereaved families. A Ph.D research fellow and organiser of the event Mayank Kumar urged the nation to remain united and speak in one tone.
IIT Bombay was in news due to the launch of PRATHAM – an academic satellite – made by the students.
The 10-kg Pratham microsatellite will measure the total electron count (TEC) in the ionosphere that can improve the accuracy of the global positioning system in India and predict tsunamis, an official of the IIT-B said.

Pakistan’s move to reveal the identities of eight Indian diplomats engaged in the Indian high commission in Islamabad reek of reckless conduct. The move has severely affected the already severed India-Pakistan diplomatic ties and further reduced any chances of pacifying the wounds inflicted by India’s neighbour.
The identities of these officials were released in the public domain and in the media which dubbed them as spies and described them as agents of India’s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). The Pakistani authorities alleged that the officials had been installed to carry out espionage activities and destabilizing operations but without giving any evidence to back any of the allegations. To ensure their safety, Indian has now chosen to withdraw these officials.

Recently, India had caught a member of the Pakistani embassy in Delhi red handed indulging in espionage activities. The individual was found to be in possession of Indian government documents relating to vital security installations and information that could seriously undermine India’s border security deployment.
India declared the spy Mehmood Akhtar as persona non grata (unwanted person) as part of the Vienna convention. According to the convention, the sending country, in this case Pakistan, would need to withdraw the official or India, which is the receiving country, could cease to recognise Akhtar as part of the Pakistani mission. Indian officials escorted Akhtar to Pakistani officials and asked them to remove him from India within a period of 48 hours. All of this was done in a civilised manner.
After these turn of events, Pakistan, which had been left red-faced, chose to withdraw six officials from their mission in India back to Islamabad amid rumours that possibly a larger spy ring was going to be busted soon.
Pakistan’s move to declare eight members of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad as persona non grata and accusing them of being part of a spy ring comes across as a tit-for-tat act of self-righteousness. The fact that they have not put up any evidence to support their claim of the Indian diplomats being spies and acting against Pakistan shows that India’s neighbour is reacting in a reckless manner.
After the Uri attack, India retaliated with surgical strikes on terror launchpads along the LoC in PoK. Multiple terrorist attacks have followed on a regular basis since. Indian government had upped its diplomatic offensive to isolate the country diplomatically, economically and strategically on the international front. There was, however, an outside chance that tensions would subside through diplomatic channels as stable relations with nuclear-powered nations like Pakistan have become a necessity, even if it turns to a blister."

When Fawad Khan, Mahira Khan and other Pakistani artistes were asked to pack their bags and leave India, many producers found themselves facing the heat, as a lot of projects were left incomplete. New problems surfaced for Karan Johar’s film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Fawad and Mahira’s Bollywood debut Raees opposite superstar Shah Rukh Khan after MNS threatened to stop the release of both the films. While ADHM is set for a Diwali release next month, Raees was scheduled to arrive on the Republic Day in January 2017. While KJo is the most tensed, the makers of Raees have also reportedly postponed the release of the film, under the prevailing circumstances.
Amidst all the animosity shared between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack, the targetted celebrities from across the border have preferred to remain silent so far. And while everyone awaited a reaction from their end, Mahira Khan subtly said something which caught the eye. She took to her Twitter handle and shared a post, which turns out to be something written by a Pakistani girl named Alizay Jaffer. Alizay had a few days ago, penned a long post on Facebook calling for peace and harmonious relationships between the two neighbours. The post soon went viral. She was showered with a lot of praise from netizens from both India and Pakistan. Even Mahira went on to share her post on Twitter mentioning ‘This’.

The Pakistani actor known for her blockbuster television show Humsafar opposite Fawad Khan, has not been very vociferous with all the new controversies but this has been one of her softly given reactions.

The letter which became famous on social media read:
It’s strange, this affinity with India. I find myself getting increasingly upset at the abuse and hatred tossed from one border to another, with little rationale apart from the 69 year old chips on our shoulders. These chips have, over time, turned into boulders, and who doesn’t crumble under the weight of those?

It’s very strange, this affinity with India. When Amitabh Bachchan is in the hospital, we pray for his good health; when Ranbir Kapoor’s film is a hit, we’re prouder than Neetu and Rishi; we never deny that no one brings romance to life like the voices of Kishore and Rafi; they are in unanimous agreement that their local music scene is not a patch on ours; if we happen to interact abroad, they’re the only pardesis we include in the ‘desi’ category; their monuments carry our history; our language carries their roots.

It’s far too strange, this affinity with India. Like siblings, we retaliate to each other’s provocations. Ultimately, we both share the label of being impulsive and emotional in our responses to one another – ‘Look at what you’re doing in Kashmir’ ‘Hah, look at what you’re doing in Balochistan’; ‘You attacked us first in Uri’ ‘Have you forgotten about Kargil’?; ‘You started it!’ ‘No! You started it!’

Like orphaned trust fund babies, we feel entitled yet have no idea how to cope. They neither acknowledge nor respond to Muslims being massacred for eating beef in Gujrat, for instance, and we? We turn a blind eye to Christians and Hindus being physically assaulted for eating before Iftar in Ramzan. They’re destroying Kashmir, we say, Kashmiris have a right to be independent (or choose us, of course), but we forget how we throttled Bangladesh – why should a Bengali speaking majority not accept Urdu as its national language? We never speak about that, do we? Too soon, perhaps.

When I think about some of my best days and nights in the last ten years, more than 50% of them were spent with my brothers and sisters from across the border; sharing a meal, listening to music, discussing politics, or anything but; laughing, dancing, singing; but most importantly, completely aware yet in vehement passive rebellion against the lines that keep us apart.

Come to think of it now, it isn’t strange at all, this affinity with India. Our proverbial Lord and Master, the gargantuan power that rules us, ‘The West’, is an absentee parent; one we’re constantly trying to please but one who never really loved us anyway. If there is anyone for us, it’s each other. What’s strange is our reluctance to acknowledge this.

What’s strange is the burden we carry of decisions made in our pasts, based on an entirely different socio-political context, when a common, exploitative antagonist made sure we saw each other as the aggressor, and boy, did we fall for it. What’s strange is our prolonged blindness to the immense opportunities that lie before us as a unit, and the vast desolation that lies before us as enemies.

The strangest thing about our relationship, in fact, is our propensity to change roles. To the world, most of the time, we are siblings; constantly at loggerheads, trying to get into daddy’s good books so that he may buy us a toy, or take us for a drive, or better yet, increase our allowance. Other times, we are like a divorced couple, sharing space, constantly bickering over who lost out in the settlement, unable to finally come to terms with the fact that we are no longer together. It seems the scars of our separation are still so ripe, so painful, that they can’t accept that we left, and we can’t accept that they let us leave. In an event like this, we only find solace in making sure the other is just as hurt as we are, so we put in our all our resources, our best efforts, to do exactly that.

I read today that India claimed they carried out a surgical attack in Uri. Ridiculous. I immediately read several, equally ridiculous Pakistani reactions; some hitting below the belt, others claiming that one shouldn’t expect more from mass murdering politicians, like the ones we have across the border. Somehow, suddenly, we are all too forgiving of our own ‘glorious’ politicians. It’s strange how quick we are to forget how much trouble governance is in, on both sides, when we jump up to point fingers.

I’m sure this news will leave me in a month’s time. What hasn’t left me is the news about a Pakistani Head of State’s arrival in Delhi for a test match, ultimately averting the threat of war; or an Indian politician putting his hand forward to greet his Pakistani counterpart, to curb tensions; or that time when Ganguly acknowledged that there’s no one greater than Wasim; or when Shoaib Malik married Sania Mirza; or that image of the guards in the most beautiful fraternal embrace I have ever seen, on Holi at Wagah Border. I suppose it’s because some of us look for peace, we hanker for it, while others, they look for war.

I suppose what I’m trying to say is, in 20 years’ time, Uri will be just another event in the text books. It will be labeled as yet another period in our collective histories when our ‘cold war’ with India almost turned into ‘hot war’. It will be just another opportunity for me to pick on my Indian friends or vice versa. It will be just another event our older uncles will discuss when they try to feel better about Pakistan’s failures and convince themselves that partition was the best thing that could’ve happened for us and that, without India, ‘we’re better off’.

What will never be ‘just another event’ is one we never address. The fact that we are now divorced; the fact that our separation is painful for both of us; the fact that where there is now hate, there was once unity and a common pride; the fact that we allowed an external power to come in and manipulate us, and we fell prey; the fact that no one will know us like we know each other, because after all, we were once but one.

It is comforting somehow, that when I messaged one of my closest friends across the border, expressing concern over the destructive megalomaniac tendencies of our governments, he responded and said, ‘It doesn’t matter what they do, you know I will always love you’. It is comforting somehow, that in 20 years’ time, if you look away from the textbooks, and turn to your ancient scriptures or your holy books, it won’t take you long to see that since time immemorial, there is only one message they are trying to convey, only one message we should be paying attention to; and that message is Love.”"

(Source: ThumpsUpOfficial/Twitter)
Beverages major Coca Cola India has dropped Bollywood superstar Salman Khan as brand ambassador for its soft drink ‘Thums Up’ after four years of association and the company is in talks with young star Ranveer Singh to replace him. It appears Salman Khan’s commitment to Bigg Boss was the reason for this change. In a joint statement, Coca-Cola India said, “Salman Khan was committed to an existing relationship with a daily TV show, which this year happens to be sponsored by a brand that competes with the Coca-Cola India product portfolio.”

“In light of this, both parties have mutually decided not to renew the current contract,” the joint statement by Salman Khan and the company said. A source said that the company is in talks with young star Ranveer Singh to replace Salman.
It seems more than Bigg Boss 10, the company’s decision to not to renew the contract with the 50-year-old actor is more to do with the image of Coca Cola, which is seen as a young brand, the source said. “That explains why Coca Cola is talking to a much younger star like Ranveer Singh,” the source added. Khan has been among the top celebrity endorsers reportedly charging Rs 5 crore per year per brand. Recently, he had courted controversy when he supported Pakistani artists saying “they were not terrorists” in the wake of a debate on whether they should be allowed to work in Indian movies after the Uri attack.
Coca-Cola India had roped in Khan as its brand ambassador for the second time to endorse its Thums Up brand in October 2012 replacing another Bollywood star Akshay Kumar. He had earlier endorsed the brand in early 2000s. At that time, Coca-Cola India had also signed an agreement with Being Human — The Salman Khan Foundation — to jointly promote, conceive and execute charitable and social activities."

INDIA Thursday said it would review the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status it granted to Pakistan based on security and trade interests, asserting that terror cannot be the commodity exported.
Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson Vikas Swarup also said the speech by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailing Hizbul militant Burhan Wani shows Pakistan’s complicity in terrorism directed against India and was “self-implicating”. Sharif had hailed Wani as “son of the Kashmiri soil” while addressing the joint session of Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday.
“Promoting shared prosperity with neighbours has been the government’s priority but terror cannot be the commodity exported. We will undertake a review based on our security and trade interests,” he said when asked if India will review the MFN status given to Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about the recent conversation between the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan, he said the Prime Ministers of the two countries had in January agreed that their NSAs will remain in touch and the details should not be made public. “India remains committed not to make it public,” he said.
Earlier this week, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz was quoted as saying by Pakistani media that India has agreed to reduce tension after their NSAs spoke over phone. This was the first such contact after the Uri attack and India’s retaliatory surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the LoC.
On the reports that Difa-e-Pakistan Council, a umbrella group of jihadi outfits, had organised a rally in Pakistan on October 28, Swarup said India has always voiced its concerns at the freedom available to such internationally designated terrorists in Pakistan to conduct and promote anti-India activities openly.
“It is up to the government of Pakistan to abide by its assurances that it will deny the use of its territory for such purposes,” he added.
Swarup also described as “inflection point” the recent cancelling of the SAARC summit after several countries of the eight-nation grouping pulled out over cross-border terrorism as till now some were only doing “lip-service” and not doing anything concrete."

Mounting a fresh attack, Congress on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to spell out the concrete steps to avert an Uri-type attack and that his election promises of tackling terrorism with an iron hand have turned out to be a “bluff”.
With the Prime Minister on Saturday issuing a blunt warning to Pakistan that the Uri attack will not be forgotten and that the sacrifice of 18 soldiers will not go in vain, Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said Modi’s speech failed to convey message on the steps to be taken to tackle terror.

“PM Modi’s speech failed to convey message on the concrete steps to tackle terrorism and avert Uri type attacks. Election promises were bluff,” Surjewala said in a tweet.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said in a tweet, “..Even Modi’s supporters disappointed with his speech, social media users said, sowed Modi, reaped Manmohan.”
Singh said Modi has “destroyed” Pakistan with verbal missiles.
In his first public address after last Sunday’s deadly attack by terrorists from across the border, Modi said yesterday in Kozhikode that India will mount an all out offensive to isolate Pakistan diplomatically to expose its activities in exporting terror, killing of innocent people and spilling blood.
Another Congress leader Manish Tewari raised questions on Modi government’s foreign policy over the presence of Russian troops in Pakistan.
“Russian troops are in Pakistan, China building CPEC Iran wants to join CPEC, Americans are in bed with Pak for Af-PAK which world does@narendramodi live in…,” Tewari tweeted."

Jagnarain Singh, 78, has been blind for the last 20 years.

The way terrorists slayed our soldiers, we should do the same,” said Jagnarain, father of Havildar Ashok Kumar Singh (44), who died in Sunday’s attack.
This is not the first such tragedy to hit the Singh family — in 1986, Jagnarain’s eldest son, Kamta Singh, a 23-year-old sepoy in the Indian Army, had died in a bomb blast in Bikaner. (click here to read more)

The last ones in Ballia’s Dubardha village to get to know about Lance Naik Rajesh Kumar Yadav’s death in the Uri terror attack were his wife Parvati Devi, who is eight months pregnant, and his ailing mother Simariya Devi, who is a heart patient.
The villagers, along with other family of Rajesh, pulled out all stops to avoid breaking the news to the two women.
“We erected barricades on the road leading to our house to ensure that no mediaperson or any relative could reach our house and talk about Rajesh’s death to my mother and his wife. We stopped everyone from visiting our house. But, some journalists managed to reach our home from the other side of the road and told about the death to Rajesh’s wife, Parvati, late in the afternoon,” said Rajesh’s youngest brother, Vikesh Yadav, who is a farmer.

A day after it promised “heavy retribution” for the killing of three of its soldiers — one of the bodies was mutilated — by Pakistanis who crossed the Line of Control in the Machil sector of north Kashmir, the Indian Army launched a fire assault Wednesday against Pakistani posts at different points along the LoC.
Pakistan said it lost three Army personnel, including a Captain, while nine civilians were killed and another nine injured when Indian fire hit a bus on the Neelum Valley road in the Dudhnial sector in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Pakistan Army named its three dead as Captain Taimoor Ali Khan, Havaldar Mushtaq Hussain and Lance Naik Ghulam Hussain.

India said Pakistan opened fire on civilian targets in the sectors of Machil, Keran and Gurez. Shells landed close to the Kishanganga dam project, forcing workers to take shelter in the tunnels there. The villages of Kanzelwan, Kufri and Malikpora, local officials said, too were hit, but there was no loss of life.
In the evening, the Ministry of Defence said Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), spoke to his Pakistan counterpart Major General Sahir Shamshad Mirza following a Pakistani request for unscheduled talks on hotline in the aftermath of the Indian Army’s “punitive fire assaults”.
Major General Mirza informed Lt General Singh about civilian casualties on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Lt General Singh expressed grief over the civilian casualties but said retaliatory firing by Indian troops only targeted locations from where Pakistan had initiated ceasefire violations. The Ministry said the DGMO conveyed concerns over casualties among Indian civilians and soldiers due to unprovoked Pakistani firing.
Raising the issue of infiltration attempts by terrorists and the mutilation of the bodies of Indian soldiers, Lt General Singh told the Pakistan DGMO to exercise strict control on his troops and refrain from nefarious activities. This would lead to return of normalcy along the LoC, the Ministry quoted Lt General Singh as telling Major General Mirza.
The Pakistan Army, in its statement, said it lodged a protest over the strike on the bus. It said an ambulance which approached the bus to evacuate the injured too was fired upon. The Pakistan DGMO, the statement said, conveyed to his counterpart that Pakistan reserved the right to respond at the time and place of its choosing.
Indian military sources said the bus had been hit by accident when it unexpectedly traversed a bend while troops stationed on the ridgeline above were bringing fire on the road to disrupt military traffic.
In New Delhi, Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner Syed Haider Shah was summoned by Gopal Baglay, Joint Secretary (in-charge of Pakistan) in the Ministry of External Affairs, who conveyed India’s strong reaction to continued ceasefire violations and mutilation of bodies of its soldiers.
On his part, Shah protested “the recent spate of unprovoked Indian firing and shelling” which, he claimed, had so far resulted in the loss of more than 50 civilian lives including women, infants and the elderly, besides several Pakistani soldiers.
The trading of shells on the LoC comes just two days ahead of the thirteen anniversary of a ceasefire that both countries agreed upon in 2003.
The killing of three Indian soldiers on the LoC were the latest in a series of violent clashes that have taken place since India raided terror launch pads following the Uri attack.
Figures obtained by The Indian Express show that violence has escalated sharply since the surgical strikes on the night of September 28, with 12 military personnel and 12 civilians recorded killed in 279 exchanges of fire recorded until November 15.
While official figures will be compiled after the month ends, government sources said the number of fire exchanges had edged past 300, and the number of military fatalities had risen to 17. No fatality had been recorded on the Indian side of the LoC until September 28, while just four exchanges of fire were reported — a record low after a steady uptick in violence which began in 2008.

PHF secretary Shahbaz Ahmed told the media that the junior hockey team would only travel to India if the government gives the green signal.
“Given the existing relations between the two countries we have asked the Pakistan Sports Board to get us clearance for the tournament,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The former Pakistan captain said that the Junior World Cup was a very important tournament for the future of Pakistan hockey but India’s reaction after the Uri attacks was not a very encouraging sign.
“We will go if the government says we can go but we are concerned specially after the way the Indians didn’t allow Pakistan to send its team for the ongoing Kabbadi Championship in Ahmedabad,” the PHF secretary said.
Hostilities between the two neighbours have escalated after India said last week it conducted surgical strikes in against militants in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (POK). The strikes came after alleged Pakistani millitants staged a deadliest attack on an Indian army base in Uri.
Relations between the hockey federations of India and Pakistan have not been cordial since the 2014 Champions Trophy when Pakistani players went overboard with their celebrations after winning the semi-final against India.
Hockey India, the national federation, has been demanding a formal apology from Pakistan and also threatened not to play any bilateral matches until then. Shahbaz said that the chapter was closed as the PHF officials at that time and even the head coach of the national team had expressed their regrets over the matter.
“We are now focusing on the Junior World Cup and the Asian Champions Trophy in Malaysia this month because in both events India is involved,” he said.
Pakistani Olympians have already expressed their disappointment at some of the statements coming from few Indian players about avenging the Uri attack by defeating Pakistan in the Asian Champions Trophy, starting October 20.
Shahbaz said that in the past Pakistan hockey teams had been regularly visiting India and faced minor issues but overall they were well looked after.
“If the government feels we can go and play there it is fine for us because security of our players and officials is responsibility of the FIH and host nation,” he added."

According to current international law, there are only two scenarios in which armed intervention by one state in the territory of another is permitted: With the authorisation of the UN Security Council or in self-defence. All other use of force is illegal. The Security Council’s authorisation comes in the form of a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter. Thus, the American intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 was legitimate since it had been approved by the Security Council whereas its invasion of Iraq in March 2003 was illegal since it did not have the UN’s endorsement.

As for the right of self-defence, it has been strictly defined in Article 51 of the Charter. This right is available only in the event of an attack by another state. It cannot be invoked in anticipation of an attack.
India’s surgical strike carried out in the early hours of September 29 is justified on two counts. It was clearly an act of self-defence after the Uri attack; the Charter does not say the right of self-defence must be exercised within a prescribed time limit. Secondly, it was not legally speaking, an armed action in the territory of another state. After the partition of the Subcontinent, Pakistan signed a Standstill Agreement with the ruler of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. India did not sign this instrument. Pakistan launched an invasion of Kashmir despite having signed the Agreement. The ruler asked for India’s help, but India refused in the absence of the ruler concluding the Instrument of Accession with India. Only after he did so did India rush troops to repulse the invaders. Thus, India’s military action in 1947 and all subsequent such actions, including the one on September 29, were within our own territory and hence not a violation of international law.

In an address on “India’s Foreign Policy” to the Indian Council of World Affairs on March 22, 1949, Prime Minister Nehru said about relations with Pakistan: “There is no doubt at all in my mind that it is inevitable for India and Pakistan to have close relations — very close relations sometime or the other in future, situated as we are, with all our past. We cannot really be just indifferent neighbours. We can either be rather hostile to one another or very friendly with one another. Ultimately, we can only be really friendly, whatever period of hostility may intervene in between”. Nehru’s conviction was understandable since he did not have to deal with another aggression by Pakistan after 1947-48.
What Nehru said in 1949 about hostility has been proved right. Unfortunately, his confidence that ultimately there have to be really good relations at some time in future has yet to be borne out after a 70-year history, mostly of hostility.
Many analysts have criticised the government’s “flip flop” policy towards Pakistan. Consistency is not necessarily a virtue in diplomacy; it might even indicate lack of adaptability to changing circumstances. Pakistan is consistent in its India policy; it is consistently hostile. But we, most of us anyway, genuinely wish for “non-hostile” relations with Pakistan. Hence, we need to be pragmatic, flexible and subtle in diplomacy. We also need to be realistic.
PM Modi was right to have tried the friendly approach by inviting Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration ceremony and also to drop in in Lahore to wish Sharif on his birthday. It is better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all.
Many Pakistan watchers believe that Nawaz Sharif genuinely wants better relations with India. Well, so far, he has given no evidence that he is unhappy with the military’s anti-India stance.
There was also a question about the wisdom of raking up the Balochistan issue. The government must have thought through the possible consequences and the end result that it might have in mind. However, unlike J&K, Balochistan is not on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
It was Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who had agreed to bring Balochistan into the bilateral agenda at Sharm el-Sheikh. The government has been careful in not calling for secession or independence for the Baloch people which will not get support from any other country. “Bangladesh” cannot be repeated in Balochistan. Perhaps the government has another objective in mind. Focusing on the hazardous security situation in Balochistan as well as in Gilgit Baltistan might give China second thoughts on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. At a minimum, it will slow down the pace of work on the Corridor. Already, China has asked Pakistan to ensure security for the projects which form part of the scheme.
The government’s campaign to diplomatically isolate Pakistan has succeeded at least beyond this writer’s expectations. In South Asia, Pakistan has been forced to postpone the SAARC summit. All other members of SAARC have condemned the Uri attack. Each of these countries has its own reasons for the decision. Nevertheless, the fact that they announced their non-participation so soon after India did suggests a solidarity with India. Internationally, all major powers have supported India. Pakistan’s effort to raise the issue in the Security Council has been rebuffed. Uri has had an impact the Pakistan establishment simply did not anticipate.
But this does not mean total isolation. Pakistan is a significant military power and has at least one reliable friend in China. The concern that some countries have expressed at the tensions and their advice to both countries to resume dialogue is legitimate and should not be taken as unfriendly to India. In this context, it is imperative for us to keep in close touch with those powers, not least with Russia.
Some political parties have expressed doubts about the army’s claim of having carried out the surgical strikes, quoting Pakistan’s denial as well as UN observers. We should dismiss the UN part of it since we do not recognise its jurisdiction. As for Pakistan, what else can one expect? The government is justified in not wanting to release the video of the operation. The Pakistan establishment is still smarting from 1971.
Releasing the video will add to their humiliation and make it impossible for them not to react in some fashion. Nevertheless, the government can and ought to take responsible politicians into confidence and arrange a private, confidential screening of the video to remove all doubts."

Till a year ago, actor Kangana Ranaut was supposed to star in director Ketan Mehta’s “heavily researched” dream project Jhansi Ki Rani: The Warrior Queen. Months later, the actor, however, moved ahead with the same character but a different filmmaker (Krrish), giving shape to Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, and leaving Ketan with a life-long lesson.
“Be careful before you trust,” the director tells indianexpress.com on being asked about the takeaway from the experience.
Ketan Mehta announced the film with Kangana Ranaut in 2016 and it was supposed to be produced by Kamal Jain. A year ago, however, the director learnt that Kangana and Kamal had gone ahead to make another film on Rani Laxmibai, Manikarnika.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ketan sent a legal notice to the actor and the producer last year accusing them of breach of trust.
Talking to indianexpress.com about the episode, Ketan had said, “She had confirmed her commitment to this project. Over this period of time, we shared all our material with her. We were planning for an international co-production for a global audience. We were planning on making this movie in Hindi and English simultaneously, to make the best advantage of a local audience as well as the global audience. That was the plan of action. And now we suddenly read in the newspapers that she is doing the same film with somebody else!”
“We had shared several drafts of the script, all the visual material and references of the film and designs over a period of time with her. We had already tied up with an international co-producer and we were looking out for an Indian co-producer. That’s when Kangana introduced us to Kamal Jain as a prospective co-producer. We shared all the information and the entire project with him. We had some meetings with him too. And then we suddenly hear that they (Kamal Jain and Kangana Ranaut) are doing the project together, independent of us. That came to us as a complete shock.” the director had added.
Kangana Ranaut is yet to address the allegation publicly. While she is gearing up for the promotions of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, Ketan is looking forward to the impending premiere of his film Toba Tek Singh. Based on one of Sadat Haasan Manto’s best stories, the film will premiere on the OTT platform ZEE5 tomorrow.
It stars Pankaj Kapur as the protagonist Bishan Singh, an inmate in a mental asylum in the newly-formed Pakistan. Singh has only one question on his mind and lips, “Where is Toba Tek Singh?” which is his native village. The film also stars Vinay Pathak.
The film was ready in 2016 but it took two years for it to see the light of day. The cause of delay wasn’t the usual absence of buyers.
Toba Tek Singh was a part of an initiative by Zee, which was green-lit in 2015 to promote peace across the India-Pakistan border. It included six filmmakers from India and six from Pakistan, who would develop films that will travel across two countries.
As the tension on the border resurfaced post the Uri attack in 2016, among many other things, the initiative also came to a standstill.
At Toba Tek Singh’s special screening, Ketan Mehta revealed that when everything was going fine, the film was supposed to air on Zindagi channel, an arm of Zee that introduced hit Pakistani dramas to Indian audience.
“Since, it was a Zindagi channel production, it was supposed to air on television. There was some kind of indication that they will try to release it theatrically as well. As a filmmaker, you always want to see your film on a big screen, larger than life. When this film was made, everyone was gung-ho about India-Pakistan friendship,” said the director, whose last big screen outing was Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer Majhi: The Mountain Man.
“By the time it was completed, the relations had soured completely and they haven’t improved since. It was supposed to be a gesture where films will travel all across Pakistan and India to give message of peace and harmony. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, because of the real politics.”
As for his future project, the filmmaker said that he is working on a script and the only thing he could reveal is that it will not be a historical. “I will take a break from history for a while and I am still writing a script. Very soon, you will get to know.”"

‘Surgical Strike’, a film based on 2016 Uri terror attack, is scheduled for a release in December. The film will feature Deepraj Rana, Mir Sarvar, Lakha Lakhwinder Singh, Jimmy Sharma, Sanjay Singh, Amit Pathak and Vedita Pratap Singh as army officers.
Last year, a terror attack at an army base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri killed 17 soldiers. The Indian Army retaliated with surgical strikes 11 days later. Under the banner of Crystal Movies, ‘Surgical Strike’ is directed by Suzad Iqbal Khan.
The film has been co-produced by Vijay Valbhnai and Sonu Jain. “It’s an honour to execute on this vision and what we believe is an engaging and thrilling story inspired by this true life incident,” Jain said in a statement.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Indian Army had many sub tactical strikes but this mission is one of the most successful ground mission till now. Apart from the thriller mission there is the basic life of these brave soldiers during the mission how bravely they made it possible and how strong the Indian Army is,” Valbhnai added.

Another film based on the same subject is in the making and is titled ‘Uri’. The film stars Vicky Kaushal in the lead role and is being directed by Aditya Dhar. ‘Uri’ is expected to release in September 2018. The film will be produced by Ronnie Screwala under his production banner RSVP.  Vicky Kaushal will play the role of the lead commander in chief in the film. Other than ‘Uri’, Vicky Kaushal is also prepping up for some other big projects like Meghna Gulzar’s ‘Raazi’ and the untitled Sanjay Dutt biopic."

The terrorist attack on Army unit in Uri has resulted in massive outrage among serving and retired military officers community on the social media who have been raising demands that the government should strongly retaliate across the Line of Control (LoC).
While many serving officers are on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter under pseudonyms, there are several who are using their real names and have not hesitated to put out their views. Pained by the loss of 18 Army jawans in the Uri attack, the comments range from demanding that the Indian Army be allowed to resume artillery fire across the LoC to mounting covert attacks against terror camps in Pakistani territory.
Some of the retired officers who are well known defence analysts have also adopted a hard stand after the Uri attack and have not minced their words demanding immediate retaliatory action from the union government. 

Brig Gurmeet Kanwal (retd), one such analyst who has commanded a brigade in the valley, tweeted that Pakistan Army posts which give support to the infiltrators into J&K must be pulverised. “Reduce Pak post through which infiltration took place to rubble,” he tweeted.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Brigadier Rahul Bhonsle (retd), another prominent defence analyst has also supported opening artillery fire on Pakistani posts besides recommending that the Indian Army should mount a special forces operations of the kind taken across the Indo-Myanmar border in Manipur against the rebels.

There have been voices of caution and reasoning too amidst the call for immediate action. Former GOC-in-C Northern Command, Lt Gen HS Panag (retd) has advised sober thinking. He tweeted, “Think at the strategic level and plan the end state even if initial response is tactical. Else the bluff will be called.” He also wrote that whatever be the action it has to be strategically thought through. Lt Gen KJ Singh (retd), who till recently was GOC-in-C Western command tweeted, “Experts will analyse and redress, fix blame. Do our bit to build capacities. Well thought out response at time and place of our choosing.”
Lt Gen Sampath Kumar (retd) advocated that Indian forces should not succumb to an immediate reaction. “Pak expects and is ready for reaction. Do not succumb. Hit at your choice of place and at time of your choosing. Surprise a key factor,” he tweeted. He also tweeted that the Indian High Commissiuoner in Islamabad should be withdrawn and the Pakistan High Commisisoner in New Delhi should be sent back.

India also named one of the four terrorists killed in the attack and their two handlers across the Line of Control. Eighteen soldiers died in the dawn attack on September 18.

He said one of the two guides, now in custody, had identified one of the four terrorists from photographs and said he too belonged to Muzaffarabad. The guide also named two Pakistan-based handlers.
Separately, India said it had also apprehended another person who confessed he had trained for three weeks with the Lashkar-e-Toiba and made donations to Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, a Lashkar front.
Jaishankar offered Pakistan consular access to the three individuals in custody. This was the second time since the Uri attack that the

Pakistani envoy has been summoned by the Foreign Secretary. He had earlier informed Basit about the recovery of several items from the terrorists — GPS, grenades with Pakistani markings, communication equipment, food, medicines and clothes made in Pakistan.
Vikas Swarup, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said villagers in the Uri sector apprehended two individuals on September 21 and turned them over to security forces. They acted as guides for terrorists and helped them infiltrate across the LoC, he said.
The two men were identified as Faizal Hussain Awan, 20, s/o Gul Akbar, resident of Potha Jahangir, Muzaffarabad; and, Yasin Khursheed, 19, s/o Mohammed Khurshid, resident of Khiliana Kalan, Muzaffarabad.
During questioning, Faizal told the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that they had guided and facilitated the border crossing of the group that attack the Army camp.

“In his preliminary statement, he identified as among the slain attackers one Hafiz Ahmed s/o Feroz, r/o village Dharbang, Muzaffarabad. He also revealed details of the two handlers of this operation — Mohd Kabir Awan and Basharat,” Swarup said.
On September 23, Pakistani national Abdul Qayoom, a resident of Sialkot, was apprehended in the Molu sector that faces Pakistan’s Sialkot sector. “The individual has confessed to undergoing three weeks of training with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba and donating substantial funds to Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, their front organisation,” Swarup said.
“We are willing to provide the Pakistan High Commission consular access to these three individuals apprehended in connection with terrorist attacks in India,” Jaishankar was quoted as having told Basit.
Referring to the earlier meeting between Jaishankar and Basit, Swarup said: “At that time, it was also conveyed that a number of items had been recovered from recent terrorist attacks that denote the involvement of organisations and individuals based in Pakistan. It was further communicated that if Pakistan wishes to investigate these cross-border attacks, Government of India is ready to provide fingerprints and DNA samples of terrorists killed in the Uri and Poonch incidents.”
“We would once again strongly urge the Government of Pakistan to take seriously its commitment not to allow terrorist attacks against India from its soil and territory under its control. Continuing cross-border terrorist attacks from Pakistan against India are unacceptable,” he said."

Army Chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag on Saturday said the attack on Uri camp in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district was a desperate attempt by militants to disrupt the democratic process in the state.
“It appears a desperate attempt to disrupt the third phase of elections. I assure the nation that these elements will not be allowed to succeed in disrupting the democratic process,” he told reporters here.
Gen Dalbir Singh, who arrived here on Saturday morning, also paid tributes to the slain security force personnel by laying wreaths on their coffins at a sombre ceremony at Badamibagh Cantonment here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He paid tributes to the slain soldiers, which included an officer of the Lt Colonel rank, saying their sacrifice will not go waste.
“I salute the brave soldiers who laid down their lives in the line of duty. Their sacrifice will not go waste. In fact, it will inspire each of us,” he added.
The Army chief reviewed the security situation in the state in the wake of the Uri attack that left 11 security force personnel dead, and other militancy-related incidents that saw two Lashkar-e-Toiba militants getting killed in an encounter in Srinagar while two civilians also lost their lives in a grenade blast in Tral town of south Kashmir.
The Army chief was brief by the top army officers of the Chinar Corps about the counter-insurgency and counter- infiltration measures in place."

A day after Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis brokered peace between MNS chief Raj Thackeray and filmmaker Karan Johar over the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, actor Shabana Azmi has slammed his actions in a series of tweets. The veteran actor wrote, “What a sorry state of affairs!CM brokers deal n buys patriotism for 5 crores!After Home minister had promised peaceful passage 4 #ADHM.”

MNS had banned the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in the aftermath of Uri attack as it starred Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. Yesterday, Thackeray said the ban has been lifted as Producers Guild has agreed not to work with Pakistani actors and filmmakers who have cast Pakistani actors have agreed to donate Rs 5 crore to army welfare fund.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Attacking Thackeray, Azmi wrote, “MNS will decide whether Im patriotic or not?I bow to d Indian Constitution Raj Thackeray does not.Whos patriotism needs questioning? (sic).” She also targeted the CM for bowing down to Thackeray’s demands despite Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh assuring a filmmakers’ delegation that Karan Johar’s film will be released without any violence in India.
“CM Fadnavis shows scant respect for Home Ministers assurance of safe passage for #ADHM. BJP better haul him up and demand explanation,” she wrote.

Shabana was supported on the issue by actor Naseeruddin Shah. While attending a book launch on Saturday evening, he slammed MNS for its unreasonable demands. “The film industry is an easy target. They (MNS) have as much fun targeting the industry as they would have while watching films made by Bollywood. We haven’t broken diplomatic ties with Pakistan, nor are we in the state of war, or have sealed our borders. Only artistes who aim to spread the message of love and peace are being attacked, he said.

Thackeray had on Saturday demanded that every producer, be it Karan Johar or Shah Rukh Khan, who has worked with Pakistani artistes should pay Rs. 5 crore to the army welfare fund as penance. They should hand over the cheque to Union Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar, click a picture and show it to the people, he had said. After submitting the cheque, they have to reveal the amount they have donated to Maharashtra CM and then to the MNS.
Fadnavis, meanwhile, has rejected the opposition charge that he has bowed down to MNS’ pressure. He said on Saturday, He rejected Opposition criticism that the government had shown its weakness by intervening in the matter. “If that were the case, we would not have cracked the whip against MNS activists who vandalised theatres. Nor would we go ahead with the release of the film on its scheduled date in theatres. From the very beginning, I have maintained that security will be provided to all theatres which are screening the film.”
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil will release on October 28."

Hits like Gully Boy, Uri: The Surgical Strike, Bharat, Mission Mangal, Manikarnika, Kesari and War prove that one surefire way of grabbing audience attention is to give them the adrenaline rush, or ‘josh’ to borrow from Uri’s ‘India-love’ lexicon. Phrases like ‘How’s the josh?’, ‘Surgical strike’ and the trusty ol’ ‘Jai Hind’ were on a new high in 2019. Indeed, such a trend shall continue until we exhaust all the patriotic possibilities that are in our arsenal. Now that Akshay Kumar has applied for an Indian passport, expect the game to be upped big time. Alright, that was a joke. (Or maybe, not).
Since Indianness was more than a passing buzz in Hindi films of 2019, we have a handful of them in our ranking, too. That’s purely because of their merit. Without further ado, here’s our list of 2019’s best Bollywood offerings. If you haven’t already seen them, a few are making the rounds on streaming sites.
Bala

Ayushmann Khurrana continues his winning streak — while maintaining his position as the chief exponent of the North Indian male identity crisis. Sorry, guys: whether it is about sex (his own in Vicky Donor and Shubh Mangal Saavdhan or his parents’ in Badhaai Ho), female voice (Dream Girl) or hair loss as in Bala, the exclusive right for modern Indian male anxieties have been sold to the highest-bidder, namely Khurrana. Directed by Amar Kaushik of Stree fame, Bala is a laughathon that looks at the impossible beauty standards set by India and the casual racism that has the power to give anyone a complex he/she isn’t likely to recover from easily. Honourable mention: superb performances by Bhumi Pednekar as Bala’s swarthy childhood friend, Jaaved Jaaferi as a Bachchan lookalike, Yami Gautam’s looks-obsessed Tik Tok star and the seasoned Seema Pahwa.
Gully Boyhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

India’s official entry to the Oscars, Zoya Akhtar’s answer to Slumdog Millionaire follows a Muslim rapper (Ranveer Singh as Murad) from Dharavi who has his own Eureka moment when he discovers poetry slam and music of the street. Despite his impoverished father’s (Vijay Raaz) resistance (“a servant’s son can only be a servant”), Murad’s fixation with rap can be the only thing that will redeem him. Surely, there are rap battles to be won — but also inner battles and personal conflict. Director Akhtar is a patron saint of coming-of-age, usually set among Juhu-Bandra’s dysfunctional fat-cats. But this is no rich boy’s angst. Murad is Akhtar’s poorest character, yet. Also her angriest and maybe the richest.
War

When was the last time you had so much fun at the movies? A pure popcorn entertainer that makes you want more? War is easily the sassiest and raciest thrill-machine Bollywood has seen in a while. The Siddharth Anand caper has a lot going for it. Trigger-happy Hrithik Roshan’s hot-bod, bronzed sexiness. Tiger Shroff’s lean-mean balletic energy. Yes, the duo also appear in a dance together and face-off against each other in exotic locales straight out of CNN Traveller spreads. Plot is simple: Kabir (Roshan) is an agent gone rogue. His protégé Khalid (Shroff) is on his tail. There are slick car and bike chases, Bond-inspired mano-a-mano on a speeding flight and other daredevilry. Plenty of talks about terrorist plots, double agents, surveillance, plastic surgery and national security — all of which is genuinely glamorous, in an old-world, ’70s-style manner. What’s more, given the sharp patriotic turn that Bollywood has taken in recent years, Anand finds a way to end the film with ‘Jai Hind.’
Section 375

Like War, Section 375 pits the mentor against pupil, this time in a courtroom. “Justice is abstract. Law is a fact,” quips old-hand Saluja (Akshaye Khanna), addressing a gathering of aspiring lawyers. At the film’s opening, the infamous Nirbhaya case is invoked. Shortly, Saluja finds himself defending a film director Rohan Khurana (Rahul Bhat), accused of rape. In the time of the contentious Me Too movement, Section 375 has the power to open a can of worms. Much of the film transpires inside a court as the judges hear the arguments and counter arguments from Saluja and public prosecutor and his former underling Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chhada). While the Me Too movement has generated sympathy in favour of women who are often the victims of male predation, director Ajay Bahl, it seems, wanted to upend this narrative. More than halfway into the movie, the audience is reminded that there may be a thin line between consent and culpability.
Uri: The Surgical Strike

Arguably the hottest property of the year (a toast of the industry as well as politics), Aditya Dhar’s war-fest shall be best remembered in the coming years as a symbol of a belligerent India. Or “new India,” as Govind Bhardwaj (Paresh Rawal) puts it. To avenge the 2016 Uri attack by a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit, Bhardwaj proposes a surgical attack on PoK launchpads. Bhardwaj is India’s wily National Security Advisor modelled on his real-life counterpart Ajit Doval. If Israel can carry out a similar retaliatory attack on Palestine without facing international sanctions, why not India on Pakistan? And so begins a covert operation to take down Pakistan’s terror dens. It’s apt that a character bearing more than a resemblance to PM Narendra Modi shows up to lead from the front, at the very top level. He’s played by Rajit Kapur, who persuades a reluctant Major Vihaan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) from near-retirement to serve his “motherland.” The metaphor couldn’t be clearer — Vihaan’s own mother (Swaroop Sampat) needs him. She’s suffering from Alzheimer’s. But Mother India beckons, too. He belongs on the border, as someone says in the film. Taut and twisty, Uri: The Surgical Strike recreates the operation with brutal precision and dramatic suspense, offering audiences a glimpse into India’s intelligence and military response. Think of edge-of-the-seat thriller like Zero Dark Thirty. But the mother motif at its heart makes it a quintessentially, dyed-in-the-wool Hindi film."

Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya took the fight against Anurag Kashyap to a different level on Sunday night when he asked how he dared question Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “insignificant Pakistanis”. He also threatened Kashyap that he will not be spared.
The singer wrote in a tweet, “ये हिम्मत ? तुच्छ दुश्मन पाक आर्टिस्ट के लिए तू @PMOIndia को question करता है, इतने गिर गए ? मगर #Indian तुम पाक प्रेमियों को छोड़ेंगे नहीं (How dare you? For insignificant Pakistani artistes you are questioning PM, you have fallen so low? You Pak lovers will not be spared).”

In an earlier tweet, Abhijeet said that after Karan Johar, they will be meted out the same treatment. The singer took to his official Twitter account to reply to Anurag’s tweet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which read, “@narendramodi Sir you haven’t yet said sorry for your trip to meet the Pakistani PM.. It was dec 25th. Same time KJo was shooting ADHM? Why?”
Abhijeet wrote to Anurag, tagging Mahesh Bhatt and Karan Johar in the same tweet along with PM Modi, “@narendramodi_in ne pehle baaton se manane Ki koshish Ki, ab unhe laat maara, aap kataar me hain, @karanjohar ke baad @MaheshNBhatt.”
In fact, earlier in the day, addressing PM Modi on Twitter, Abhijeet said that people like him will handle “anti India Brigade” and the Prime Minister can continue making India proud. This is not the first time that Abhijeet has spoken against Karan Johar. He has targeted Karan for casting Fawad Khan in his film a number of times.

In fact, Abhijeet is not the only one to take a stand against Anurag Kashyap, hours after the director targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking apology for his Pakistan trip in December last year. Madhur Bhandarkar also slammed Kashyap for his ‘protest’. When Bhandarkar was asked about his reaction on Kashyap’s statements, he said, “Whatever Anurag Kashyap said is wrong, Neither BJP nor the Government issued any ban, it has become a trend to protest against Modi Ji.”

While all of this is leading to a discussion on Twitter, Anurag decided to keep away from naming anyone and just said that he would directly speak to PM Modi. He wrote a couple of tweets, “I refuse to live in the fear created by blind fanatics that you cannot have a conversation with your PM or question him or expect from him.”
He continued, “I would rather ask my questions directly to the PM than trying to impress him by fake nationalism of banning what puts you in news.”

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was in the eye of the storm in the aftermath of the Uri attack that killed 18 Indian soldiers. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena threatened all Pakistani artists working in India to leave the country. Ever since, the debate on the ban of artists from the neighbouring country hasn’t died down. Recently, Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) announced that they would not screen Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Fawad Khan in four states, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa. A lot of people from the industry have come out in support of Johar, who will bear a lot of losses if the COEAI doesn’t change its decision on the movie that’s slated to release on October 28, just two days before Diwali."

Director Ayan Mukherjee has said that his close friend Actor Ranbir Kapoor is worried about the controversy surrounding the release of his upcoming romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Owing to its casting of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, the movie has drawn ire of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena which has threatened to stall its release in theatres, slated during Diwali on October 28.
More from the world of Entertainment:

“Ranbir is tensed, everyone is worried about how things are unfolding. He is hoping for the best,” Ayan told reporters here at the opening of 18th  MAMI Mumbai International Film Festival. Actress Richa Chaddha also voiced her support for the Karan Johar-directed film.
“If one film could finish terrorism, we could have banned many other films earlier,” she said at the event. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh today extended the Centre’s support to makers of the movie and assured security

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has been in the eye of controversy since the Uri attack last month, following which various sectors have been demanding a ban on Pakistani artists from working in India.
Last week, Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India announced it would not release movies featuring Pakistani artistes in four states of Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat and Karnataka.
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has become the first target of those who are against the inclusion of Pakistani artistes in Indian films after the September 18 Uri attack which killed 19 Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack was followed by surgical attacks that India conducted across LoC.
The subsequent bilateral unrest between India and Pakistan had a spill over in film industries on both sides of the border. While the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to quit India, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution asking producers to avoid working with talent from Pakistan."

The inter-ministerial task force, set up by Modi government to look into strategic aspects of Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, discussed ways to fast-track hydropower projects of 8500 MW-capacity in Jammu and Kashmir during its first meeting held here on Friday. Chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principal secretary Nripendra Mishra, the meet was attended by NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa and Water Resources Secretary Shashi Shekhar as well chief secretaries of Punjab and J&K.
“The issues of fast-tracking implementation of hydroelectricity projects in Jammu and Kashmir were discussed during the meeting. We discussed what will be the ways of financing and structuring of the projects,” top sources said. These projects including Tulbul Navigation, intended at developing India’s rights over both eastern and western

rivers, will require consent of government of Jammu and Kashmir, which is expected to get back to the task force next month on the issues discussed, they said.
“We will take it forward only when there is consent of the Jammu and Kashmir government. The state’s representative did not have mandate. So, the representative will speak to their Chief Minister (Mehbooba Mufti) and after that we can take the implementation forward,” they added. India has identified setting up hydroelectricity projects of a total of 18,000 MW capacity. Of these, 3000 MW have already been established.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
ALSO READ: Pause and effect: What newest twist in Indus Treaty tale means
The Centre now intends at further development of 1800 MW capacity projects including Ratle (850 MW) in the first phase. In the second phase, 5500 MW capacity projects are expected to be developed. “These projects are on both the Eastern (Beas, Ravi and Sutlej) and Western rivers (Indus, Chenab and Jhelum). We will develop capacities in accordance with our rights under the water distribution pact,” the sources added.
Meanwhile, on asked about the government’s meeting with World Bank expert to discuss Pakistan’s objection over Kishenganga (330 MW capacity) and Ratle projects being constructed in Jammu and Kashmir, the sources said a communique to this regard is “awaited”.
Pakistan had in September approached World Bank, flagging concerns that the design of the Kishenganga project was not in line with the criteria laid down under IWT. It had then demanded the international lender to set up a Court of Arbitration to look into the matter. Refuting the claims made by Pakistan, India had asserted that the project design is “well within parameters” of the treaty and urged the World Bank to appoint a neutral expert as the issue is a “technical matter” as suggested in the treaty.
The international lender had then set up two separate mechanisms of COA as well as the neutral expert, which India objected to. The mechanisms were then “paused” by the Bank in view of the objections. The inter-ministerial task force was formally formed last week, nearly three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on the 56-year-old water distribution pact with Pakistan in the aftermath of series of cross-border terror strikes including Uri attack.
In that meeting, it was also decided that India would exploit to the maximum water of Pakistan-controlled rivers including Jhelum. Under the Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 and to which the World Bank is also a party, the global body has a specified role in the process of resolution of differences and disputes."

Militants Monday morning attacked the head office of Jammu and Kashmir Entrepreneurship Development Institute (JKEDI) in the Pampore area in the outskirts of Srinagar. The attack is the latest among a series of attacks and ceasefire violations since the September 18 Uri attack in which 19 Indian security personnel were killed after four terrorists attacked an army camp in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir.

As IPL fever hits cricket lovers, veteran Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor chimed in with a wish to see Pakistani players in action in the 10th edition of the event. Kapoor took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the absence of the Pakistani cricketers from the event since 2008. Pakistani players were part of the inaugural season of IPL in 2007 and in 2008. However, after the 26/11 Mumbai attack, there were many controversies surrounding the players, coaches and even commentators from the neighbouring country.

Kapoor who is known for his active social media presence and unabashed takes on contemporary issues wrote, “IPL. You got world players. Afghanistan makes debut. My plea is please consider Pakistani players.Phir match hoga! Hum bade log hain.Please!”

The debate surrounding the ban of Pakistani nationals in sports and films have been looming over for many years now, particularly escalating to a great deal last year following the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The controversy stirred a national debate after MNS demanded a ban on Pakistani artists working in Indian film industry that majorly affected makers of ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’, a film in which Kapoor’s son Ranbir Kapoor was part of. During the controversy too Kapoor took a neutral stand on the ban and said, “Think. Why only Pakistani artists should condemn the terrorist attack?Whole of Pakistan should.After all they deny any hand in the Uri attack”

Twitterati from both India and Pakistan responded in a positive manner and echoed his thoughts. Many users too felt that sports should be kept away from politics and can be a tool to repair relationships and mitigate gap, however, there were many who did not agree.

This newspaper has revealed that the terrorists who attacked the XVI Corps headquarters scaled its wall simply by climbing a tree growing alongside the officer’s mess. The technique was almost identical to that used by terrorists in Pathankot, where they took advantage of Eucalyptus trees next to the boundary wall. Even though J&K Governor N.N. Vohra had ordered a security review of all bases after the Pathankot attack, the military experts who audited the Nagrota base were either careless or remiss. That terrorists wish to kill Indian soldiers does not surprise; the failure to address glaring problems, though, is shocking.
Lapses like these could be condoned if they did not involve the lives of women and men who serve the country — and if the means to protect them were not so easily available and affordable. In the wake of the Pathankot attack, the ministry of defence had tasked former army Vice-Chief Lieutenant-General Philip Campose with studying the problem. General Campose’s report recommended rectification of the training of base security teams, as well as acquisition of technologies like night-vision devices and movement sensors. These technologies were not purchased when the Uri attack took place; they were not available at Nagrota either.
In any other country, these failures would have sparked a national scandal. In India, the deaths of soldiers barely provoke concern — a silence passed off as patriotism. The country has not been told why there was no perimeter wall at Uri, though funds had been found to build a golf course there. In the absence of accountability, it ought to surprise no-one that neither the ministry of defence nor the army leadership feel any sense of urgency to rectify the situation. Thus, a toxic culture of mediocrity runs through the executive leadership of institutions that are India’s ultimate guardians. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar needs to let sunlight into the stables, and then set to work in earnest with shovel and broom."

INDIA HAS constituted a high-level task force under Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra to decide on measures to be taken to ensure full utilisation of its share of river waters under the Indus Water Treaty. This comes amid a fresh round of bickering with Pakistan over an old issue relating to a hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir.
Government sources told The Indian Express that India was not considering the option of walking out of the Indus Water Treaty in the near future, but was keen to ensure that all the water it was entitled to was fully utilised for development.
Watch What Else Is making News

The Indus Water Treaty of 1960 allocates the waters of three rivers of the Indus basin to India and of the other three to Pakistan. All the six rivers flow from India to Pakistan. India has full rights over the so-called eastern rivers — Sutlej, Beas and Ravi — while it must allow the three western rivers — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — to flow unrestricted to Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India can utilise water of western rivers for “non-consumptive” uses, in the manner prescribed in the treaty, but has not done so. Even the waters of the eastern rivers have not been exploited to their full capacities.
Following the Uri attack, the government had decided to take a hard look at the treaty, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi declaring that “blood and water could not flow together”.
The formation of the task force is another step by the government to assert its rights on the river waters in the Indus basin. The task force has NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa among its members. It is expected to hold its first meeting next week to review all projects and other ongoing activities on the six rivers on the Indian side.
The task force already has an emerging crisis to deal with. Pakistan has lodged a fresh complaint with World Bank over a run-of-the-river project on Kishanganga river in Jammu and Kashmir. It has also raised a dispute over construction of Ratle Dam over Chenab river. The World Bank, which brokered the Indus Water Treaty in 1960, acts as mediator in such disputes. Pakistan has complained that the Kishanganga project violates the treaty and demanded setting up of a Court of Arbitration.
India has opposed the need for a Court of Arbitration and has filed a separate request with World Bank, asking only for the appointment of a neutral expert to assess whether the design of the project conformed to provisions of the treaty.
The World Bank had earlier said it would initiate both proceedings but, following India’s objection, it announced Wednesday that it was declaring a ‘pause’ to allow the two countries to “consider alternative ways to resolve their disagreements”."

Popular Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan says the series of events that followed the September 2016 Uri attack were anything but good. He hopes the “bridge of love” between the two nations doesn’t snap, and god willing, he will perform in India soon. Ties between India and Pakistan rapidly worsened after the attack on the army base in Jammu and Kashmir. From a few Indian outfits imposing a ban on Pakistani artistes working in this country to some Pakistani theatres pulling down Indian movies, the entertainment industries on both sides of the border also felt the after-effects.
“I hope the issues get solved. But I would like to say that whatever happened in both the countries, it was very bad,” Rahat, who faced a backlash from some Indian celebrities for not condemning the Uri attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead, told IANS over the phone from Lahore. Rahat has now come up with a single “Saware”, a collaboration with Indian composer-lyricist Anupama Raag. Unveiled by Times Music on Friday, the song’s video features Bollywood actor Kunal Kemmu.

Earlier this year, Bollywood actress Ileana D’Cruz was criticised by some Indians for featuring in Pakistani singer Atif Aslam’s song “Pehli dafa”. Rahat’s “Yeh jo halka halka suroor hai” single last month, which had a video starring Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana, also didn’t go down well with some. So, is he also fearing a negative response to the new single? “I don’t think it will be criticised,” he said. Asked about the demand for a ban on Pakistani artistes from working in India, he said: “Artistes’ work cannot be stopped. We have always chosen the path of love. Sometimes, some elements try to damage the bridge of love. But the ones who want to use the bridge, they do.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The video of his track was shot in Lucknow in June, but took six months to get released. Was it due to the terror attack? He simply said: “It takes time in making a video. There is post-production and lots of other matters. That’s why it took a while to release it.”
Reminiscing the shooting days in Lucknow, which has various architectural wonders, he said: “I had visited Lucknow twice before that, for shows. But I shot there for the first time for ‘Saware’. I had heard a lot about its palaces and historical monuments… Finally got to see them. It was really hot though that time.”
Along with the response to the song, Rahat is looking forward to the tribute tour to his uncle and the late music maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who died on August 16, 1997.
“It will begin from April in North America.” Will the tour be his return ticket to India, where he has often performed and also had to face problems – be it his detention at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport for undeclared foreign currency or his deportation from Hyderabad?
Without revealing whether he will perform in India or not, he said: “Inshallah”. The singer, who has given many Bollywood hit numbers like “Teri meri”, “O re piya” and “Jag ghoomeya”, concluded the conversation on a melodious note by singing a few lines of “Chaahat”."

The initial investigation by the Army in the Uri attack that claimed the lives of seventeen jawans indicates the role of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan based terrorist group.
Speaking to media after the attack, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said that he has spoken to his Pakistani counterpart regarding the incident as weapons recovered from the slain terrorists had Pakistan marking.
“Foreign terrorists were behind the attack. Our initial reports indicate the role of JeM. Four AK 47, 4 Under Barrel Grenade Launchers and other war like stores were recovered from the four terrorists who were killed. All the weapons had Pakistan marking,” said Singh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh also said that the Indian Army is ready for a befitting response. “I assure you that Indian army is prepared for any evil design by the adversary and will give a befitting response,” said Singh.
He said that the terrorists had fired incendiary ammunition along with automatic fire of small arms that led to army tents and temporary shelters catching fire.
“There have been a total of 17 Army fatal casualties. Of these, 13-14 casualties have been due to these tents/shelters having caught fire,” he said.

Heavily armed militants stormed the rear office of an infantry battalion of the Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the terror strike in which four ultras were neutralised.
It was believed that the attack was the handiwork of a freshly infiltrated group of militants who could have entered along the Salamabad Nallah into the town.
The Home Minister has also called an emergency meeting to review the situation arising out of the terror attack"

In 1216, Genghis Khan sent envoys to Samarkand, the capital of Ala ad-Din Muhammad II, Emperor of Khwarezm, bearing gifts of gold, jade, ivory and cloaks spun from the hair of white camels. “I know your power and the vast extent of your empire”, his letter read, “and I regard you as my most cherished son. For your part, you must know that I have conquered China and all the Turkish nations north of it; my country is an anthill of soldiers and a mine of silver, and I have no need of other lands. Therefore, I believe I have we have an equal interest in encouraging trade between our lands”.
WATCH VIDEO | ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’

 
The imperial consensus was that Genghis Khan’s forces were too stretched to pose a threat—and Muhammad II decided to show the Khan what he thought of his peace offering. In 1218, the Khwarezm Shah killed 450 Mongol merchants, following it up with the execution of an ambassador.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Less than two years later, the Khwarezm disintegrated in the face of the Mongol assault. Genghis Khan, proclaiming himself “the flail of god”, built towers outside Samarkand’s walls with the skulls of his enemies.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just been delivered an unhappy lesson at the just-concluded BRICS summit in Goa: though nine-tenths of geopolitics is about bluff, the critical one-tenth is about knowing when to fold.
WATCH | Pakistani troops violate ceasefire in Jammu Kashmir’s Rajouri District

 
The Prime Minister proclaimed, in his closing statement at the summit, that BRICS member-states were “agreed that those who nurture, shelter, support and sponsor such forces of violence and terror are as much a threat to us as the terrorists themselves”. The BRICS 109 paragraph summit declaration, however, doesn’t have a single sentence reflecting this purported consensus—not even the words “nurture”, “shelter” or “sponsor”.
Worse, from India’s optic, the summit declaration calls for action against all United Nations-designated terrorist organisations which include the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad but names only the Islamic State and al-Qaeda’s proxy, Jabhat al-Nusra—both threats to China and Russia but not to India.
Watch What Else Is Making News

 
China’s President Xi Jinping, said success against terrorism made it imperative to “addresses both symptoms and root causes”—a stock-phrase Islamabad often uses to refer to the conflict over Kashmir. Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of terrorism emanating from Pakistan at all.
Add to this, the United States’ studied refusal to be drawn into harsh action against Pakistan and there’s a simple lesson to be drawn: less than a month after it began, the Prime Minister’s campaign to isolate Pakistan is not gaining momentum.
No one seriously disputes New Delhi’s right to punish cross border-terrorism—even Pakistan’s best-friend China offered no reproach when India struck across the Line of Control, and has been quietly counselling Pakistan to get its house-jihadists under control. However, there’s a big difference between quite counsel and public censure; Pakistan is far too useful to all the world’s big powers in a number of ways.
For one, both China and Russia, as well as Iran, see Pakistan as a potential ally in their anti-jihadist game. The Islamic State and al-Qaeda, now being slowly choked in Syria and Iraq, are likely to divert a significant portion of the resources to Afghanistan as the war against them proceeds. That means numbers of Uighur and Russian Muslim jihadists could be located close to their homelands’ borders. Beijing and Moscow will then need Islamabad’s cooperation.
Interestingly, both countries have already expanded their covert outreach to the Afghan Taliban, seeing them—rightly or wrongly—as a counterweight to the Islamic State.
Then, Moscow is increasingly skeptical about the US combatting Islamists. Last year, when Putin travelled to New York, he called for “a genuinely broad international coalition” to fight the Islamic State. His efforts to bring one about on Syria, though, have fallen apart—leaving Moscow persuaded that the United States’ war on terror is insincere and opportunistic.
Finally, New Delhi has no chips to cash in because of its dogged refusal to be embroiled in its allies’ wars. Given New Delhi’s indecision on participation in the war against the Islamic State, it is not in any position to ask Russia for a return favour on Pakistan. Nor can New Delhi credibly ask the US to jettison Pakistan when India remains, at best, a marginal provider of security in Afghanistan.
New Delhi has no real ability to project military power across its borders. Its economic influence is limited, compared to that of China or even Russia.
By contrast, Pakistan profits from being a nuisance. Its covert services have birthed toxic proxies, who can spawn savage small wars across the region. This doesn’t make Pakistan popular but it does give it influence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s failure to distinguish between performance theatre intended for audiences at home and the real business of power has caused India some embarrassment. This is a good time to learn lessons, time for a clear-eyed, unsentimental look at the problem—and for learning some painful lessons."

Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs, said that he would travel to India to attend the Heart of Asia Conference in December, asserting that his visit could be a “good opportunity” to “defuse the tension” between India and Pakistan. The conference is scheduled to be held in India on December 3 in Amritsar. Aziz would be the first senior Pakistani official to visit India since the September 10 Uri attack, blamed on Pakistan-based militants, that led India to pull out of the SAARC Summit in Pakistan in November.

“Unlike India, that had sabotaged SAARC summit in Pakistan by pulling out, Pakistan will respond by participating in the Heart of Asia being held in India,” Aziz told the media. “It’s a good opportunity to defuse the tension,” PTV quoted Aziz as saying.
Dawn reported that Aziz also said he himself will participate in the conference and will not repeat India’s blunder where it boycotted South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Aziz, however, said it has not been confirmed yet whether he will meet his Indian counterpart on the sidelines of the conference or not.
The Advisor also said that the US president-elect Donald Trump would deserve Nobel prize if he intervenes and succeeds in resolving the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan. “Trump would deserve Nobel prize if he helps resolve Kashmir dispute,” he said on a lighter note while responding to a question."

Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti is right — India and Pakistan must talk. Her statement in the J&K Assembly was an anguished appeal for plain common sense. Unfortunately, common sense seems to be in short supply. That is why she prefixed her plea with the assertion that she does not care if she is labelled “anti-national” for saying this. She knows better than anyone else that the situation in her state has deteriorated on three fronts. First, there has been a sharp increase in ceasefire violations on the Line of Control. Second, infiltration from across the border is continuing.
And third, neither attacks by militants nor even the number of militants has decreased despite police and security forces killing over 200 of them. When the PDP and BJP came together to form the ruling alliance in 2015, both parties agreed that India-Pakistan dialogue, and talks between all “internal stakeholders”, were essential for peace in Kashmir.
While the Narendra Modi government has steadfastly refused to hold “internal” talks, the Pathankot rebuff to the PM’s Lahore visit, followed by the Uri attack, has made even talk about talks taboo, at least for public consumption — as this newspaper has reported, the National Security Advisers have held regular meetings. But there are limits to how much secret talks between top security officials can do to alleviate the situation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The cutting off of all public engagement, as has been evident since the Mumbai attacks, is not just a policy of diminishing returns, it also robs India of a platform at which to present its concerns with Pakistan. It makes no sense that India should on the one hand stand firm that all issues between the two countries have to be resolved bilaterally, and on the other refuse to have talks. Sadly, the only conclusion from the government’s reluctance to make any effort towards dialogue is that the deaths on the LoC and the terrorism and militancy in Kashmir are less worrisome to it than the perceived political risk of talking to Pakistan. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has warned that “Pakistan will pay” for the Sanjuwan attack. BJP rhetoric after the Army’s well-publicised post-Uri strike across the LoC was that it had “taught Pakistan a lesson”, but events have arguably proved otherwise. A responsible government should be able to tell the people that war is not an option, as it will mean more destruction, more deaths of soldiers and people.
It is also unfortunate that the Minister Sitharaman should blame the “demography” of the neighbourhood around Sanjuwan for the attack. J&K is communally polarised, and Jammu has become more so in the last four years. The last thing the country needs is more divisions among the people."

Continuing his attack on the Opposition for questioning the February 26 Balakot air strike, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday asked people to recognise them as the “tukde tukde gang” and said the Air Force strike had surprised Pakistan, which “was expecting another surgical strike”.
Addressing a rally in Greater Noida, the Prime Minister accused the previous government of not responding to the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai: “These attacks (26/11) were linked to the country across the border. What did the previous government do? They changed the Home Minister and not their policy. You tell me, should they change their Home Minister or their policy?”
He said that some people continued to question the Balakot air strike across the border. “Pakistan is saying that Modi attacked. And here, people lost their sleep. They began at 7-8 am asking, is Balakot in India or Pakistan? Is it in PoK or next to our Kashmir? It has not even been investigated,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also praised the government for surprising Pakistan by changing tactics. “We answered the terrorists and their leaders in the language they understand, after the Uri attack. Will you accept a government which sleeps? Will you accept a chaukidar who sleeps? You need a chaukidar who is awake,” he said.
“Woh soch rahe the Modi ne pehli baar surgical strike kari, toh is baar bhi aisa hi kuch karenge. Aur isliye unhone kya kiya seema par bade tainati kar di. Tank laakar pata nahi kya kya rakh diya unhone saari sajawat kar di. Hum upar se chale gaye (They thought Modi will repeat the surgical strike like he did last time. That’s why they increased security at the border. They put tanks and what not. They put in all decoration, but we went in from above).”
Referring to Opposition leaders, he said that some politicians were making controversial remarks which were applauded in Pakistan. “Aise logon ko desh ki janta ne sahi raste par lana chahiye ya nahi? Aap karoge? Ye kaise log hain inko pehchaniye, ye tukde tukde gang kaisi hai (Should such people be shown the right way by the people of the country or not? Will you do it? Recognise such people for who they are).”
The Prime Minister was in Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park 2 to inaugurate the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology, an academic wing of the Archaeological Survey of India whose foundation was laid by Rajnath Singh in 2016. He also flagged off the 6.5 km extension of the Delhi Metro’s Blue Line from Noida City Centre to Noida Electronic City and laid the foundation stone for two thermal power plants, in Khurja and Bihar’s Buxar, on video conference.
Modi was accompanied by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma who is also the local MP from Gautam Buddha Nagar."

Watch What Else Is Making News

Pakistan had also approached the World Bank, the mediator between the two countries of the 57-year-old water distribution treaty, in August last year raising issues over Kishanganga and Ratle in Jammu and Kashmir. While there is no confirmation so far whether issues relating to these two projects will figure during the two-day meet as they are before the WB, the source said Pakal Dul, Miyar and Lower Kalnai may be discussed. “Pakistan has been raising concern over designs of the three projects for at least two-three years now.
“These issues may be discussed as there has not been any resolution yet,” the source said, but stressed “these projects do not violate the pact”. The three projects, being built on tributaries of Chenab river, are in the pre-construction/under-construction stages. Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai are being built in Jammu and Kashmir at cost of Rs 7464 crore (November 2008 price level) and Rs 396 crore respectively.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Miyar hydroelectricity project, located in Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul Spiti district, is estimated to cost Rs 1125 crore.
The commission, which has officials from both the countries as its members, was set up under the treaty to discuss and resolve issues relating to its implementation. It is mandatory for the commission to meet at least once in a fiscal, alternately in India and Pakistan. The PIC’s meeting, to be attended by India’s Indus water commissioner and MEA officials, will take place nearly six months after New Delhi decided to suspend talks on the pact in the wake of the Uri terror attack by Pakistan-based outfits. The PIC had last met in May 2015 here.
India had on Friday downplayed its participation in the upcoming meeting in Pakistan to discuss issues relating to sharing of Indus river water, saying it does not amount to resumption of government-level Indo-Pak talks. Declaring that “blood and water cannot flow together”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a meeting in September to review the treaty in the backdrop of the terror strikes, including the Uri attack. After the meeting, officials had announced that the government has decided to suspend further talks and increase the utilisation of rivers flowing through J&K to fully exercise India’s rights under the pact."

In the aftermath of Uri attack that killed 18 Indian soldiers, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena threatened all the Pakistani artists working in India to leave the country. Ever since, the debate on the ban of artists from the neighbouring country hasn’t died down. Recently, Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) announced that they would not screen Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Fawad Khan in four states, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa.

A lot of people from the industry have come out in support of Johar who will bear a lot of losses if the COEAI doesn’t change its decision on the movie that’s slated to release on October 28, just two days before Diwali.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Amid the long list is filmmaker Anurag Kashyap who took to Twitter to show his support. “The World must learn from us.. We solve all our problems by blaming it on movies and banning it.. #ADHM . With you on this @karanjohar” he tweeted on October 15.
However, earlier this morning, Kashyap tweeted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t apologised for his meeting with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 2015 when Johar was shooting for his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. “@narendramodi Sir you haven’t yet said sorry for your trip to meet the Pakistani PM.. It was dec 25th. Same time KJo was shooting ADHM? Why?” he tweeted.
But this tweet didn’t go down well with people on social media who criticised Kashyap for blaming Modi for the ban while it’s the decision of COEAI. Most of them trolled him asking to apologise for some of his films and one of the users even tweeted, “Introducing another AK who blames Modi for everything”.

Women activists of Jammu Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) today held protests against Pakistan accusing it of Uri terror attack and promoting terrorism on Indian soil. The protestors also accused the central government of failing to protest its citizens, to create an atmosphere of peace and security in the Jammu and Kashmir. Around 150 women activists raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and council of Ministers for failing to respond appropriately to Pakistan-supported terror.

They took out a procession from Press Club to Tawi Bridge and blocked the vehicular traffic.

“Pakistan has stepped up its nefarious activities in the last two years with increased support to separatist and anti-nationals in Kashmir and sending terrorists across the Line of Control (LOC) and international border (IB),” she said.
She alleged appeasement policy pursued by the Centre and the state had largely emboldened the anti-national forces in the Valley.
Asserting that anti-national movement in Kashmir has increased during the BJP rule, Singh said militancy-related incidents in the Kashmir Valley have increased and also border incursions and infiltration.
She said the situation which was normal prior to the last Assembly polls in J-K but it has deteriorated as BJP was toeing the PDP line."

Even though the 2008 credit crisis and the “treacherous recovery” of global economy has impacted growth among the BRICS countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday said the potential and the inherent strength of the five-nation grouping of emerging economies continues to be unchanged. Addressing the Business Council Summit here today, the Chinese President said the global economy is yet to fully recover from the 2008 credit crisis and is still struggling with a “treacherous recovery”.
WATCH VIDEO: ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’


Admitting that the crisis of 2008 has not only “slowed down BRICS economies” but they are still “facing challenges” even after eight years of the worst recession since the 1930s, Xi, however, stressed that the “potential and the strength” of the grouping is “unchanged” and they continue to remain positive from a long-term perspective.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said innovation holds “the key to leapfrog” development in BRICS countries and urged businesses to follow this path for a steady and sustainable economic development.
Even though the global headwinds exist, he said there are both challenges as well as opportunities in this new phase of partnership for the nearly two-decade-old idea of BRICS.
Xi urged the businesses to “seize” all the available opportunities, increase their investments and undertake actions which will boost the confidence of the markets, the public and as well as the international community.
The comments come at a time when the export-led growth model of the Chinese economy has been hit with lingering slowdown due to the crisis in the global economy.
Beijing’s decades of high savings and debt-driven investment push failed to create a large domestic market, which in the face of the global slowdown has scuppered the plans of the leaders of the Communist country.
Known for its decades of double-digit growth, the world’s second largest economy is also fending of a trillions of dollars of bad loans and corruption. The slowdown is so entrenched that many analysts have been warning of a Chinese hard-landing anytime now.
Brazil, the second largest constituent of the five-nation grouping, is also struggling with a near contraction in growth coupled with high inflation and lingering political troubles, while the resources rich Russia is associated with geopolitical risks as it fends for global sanctions following the annexation of the Crimea in Ukraine late last year and the lingering plunge in global crude prices.
Russia is home to one of the world’s largest oil reserves, but a near 55 per cent fall in crude and gas prices since the summer of 2014 has left its sanction-hit economy in tatters.
Xi underlined the need for “result-oriented” cooperation among the BRICS and also asked the Business Council to explore the idea of joint implementation of big projects.
The Chinese leader said the New Development Bank, which began operations in Shanghai last year, is the outcome of a similar result-oriented approach and affirmed Beijing’s commitment to fully back its activities.
Newly-appointed Brazilian President Michel Temer, who came to power after his predecessor Dilma Rouseff’s impeachment a few months back, said his administration will speed up economic reforms by creating more jobs in an anaemic economy and also affirmed his commitment to maintain the ecological concerns.
The largest South American nation will streamline its bureaucracy so that work get implemented faster, Temer said, and declared that his administration has identified as many as 34 projects in the roads, highways, ports and oil sectors to boost an anaemic economy which has been degrowing of late.
He claimed that the largest Latin American economy, which recently hosted the Rio Olympics, already sees signs of the recovery being underway.
Russian President Vladmir Putin said business plays an important role in both sustainability and accelerating growth and underlined that BRICS members are home to some of the most promising consumer markets in the world.
South African President Jacob Zuma said the activities of the BRICS Business Council over the past three years have reached a stage where it can play the role of a catalyst for growth.
Zuma, facing massive unemployment since the return to democracy around two decades back and nationwide students strife, also outlined the areas where partnerships are needed, including insurance and re-insurance, a BRICS seed bank, infrastructure including power generation and transmission, aviation and large scale manufacturing so that massive number of jobs can be created.
The largest African economy has an official unemployment level of 25 per cent while the actual joblessness is much higher."

Latching on to the Uri attack, comedian Tanmay Bhat, who has recently garnered reputation for commenting on every on-going political debate in his unique style, tweeted a school incident where he was asked to debate whether India and Pakistan should go to war over Kashmir. The comedian recounted how he had to argue against the motion and won the debate, but lost respect of his fellow mates.
He started narrating the incident describing how anxious he felt going up against a “bright kid” for arguing against the popular opinion. Bhat recounted how his opponent began with an anecdote that won over the audience. 
“The kid got onto stage and began narrating an incident. Genius, begin with an anecdote. Should’ve thought of that myself,” Bhat tweeted. By the time he was done narrating, the crowd joined him in chanting “Bharat Mata ki Jai”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He went on to write how he lost his fellow students respect when he successfully argued against the option of nuking Pakistan.

On Sunday, four terrorists carried out an attack at the rear office of the infantry battalion at an army camp in Uri, killing at least 17 army personnel. The security forces eliminated all the four terrorists in an encounter that ended a little after 8 am.
According to the preliminary investigations by the army, the militants belonged to the Pakistan-based militant outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. The attacks have been condemned by every leader of the country, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said that those behind the attack would not be spared.
The Uri attack has fueled the debate, once again, on what should India’s response be on constant acts of ‘terrorism’ from ‘one particular neighbouring country, with several leaders from India reiterating the demand for hard action. BJP leader Ram Madhav said that India should give ‘jaw for tooth’ to Pakistan, while Home Minister Rajnath Singh has declared Pakistan “a terrorist state”.

















The comedian was once again able to make a point on the on-going issue using his quirky humour."

Uri: The Surgical Strike director Aditya Dhar says its popular dialogue ‘How’s the josh?’, which has been invoked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers, comes from a childhood memory.
The film is based on the 2016 Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan as a retaliation for the Uri attack that claimed the lives of 17 army personnel. The film features Vicky Kaushal in the lead role.
Recalling the story behind the catch-phrase, Aditya told PTI, “I had some friends from defence background, so with them, I used to go to a lot of Army clubs. There was one in Delhi where we used to go for Christmas or New Year parties. There used to be a retired Brigadier who would line up all the kids in front of him and have a chocolate in his hand.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“He would say ‘How’s the josh?’ and we were to respond with ‘High Sir!’ The kid who was the loudest got the chocolate. Being a foodie, I used to be the loudest and always got the chocolate,” Aditya told PTI.

The phrase has acquired a life of its own, something that the director had never anticipated.
“I have heard very few Army people use the phrase. It is not something which is used extensively. What I did was I used the line in the right way in the film and now it has taken off to another level.”
When Aditya sat down to pen Uri: The Surgical Strike, he knew he had to include the line.
“The line was there right from the first draft. As a writer, we write according to our personal experiences, our memories. It is an amalgamation of everything. I had the line with me in my memory and this was the perfect film for it to come out.”

The film, which released on January 11, has emerged as a huge blockbuster, still running to packed houses and all set to enter the Rs 200-crore club.
For the first-time filmmaker, Aditya says the response has been “magical, beautiful” and the magnitude of love coming the film’s way was something the team never anticipated.
The film’s journey-and it’s eventual success-is stuff of legends for Aditya.
The director was working on Raat Baaki, which was supposed to feature Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead but Khan had to exit the project after Pakistani artistes were banned from working in India in the aftermath of the Uri attacks.

Aditya turned the situation on its head and made a different film, which has not only been a box office success but also taught him to use the unpredictable nature of the business in his favour.
“I learnt in this industry that whatever the adversity, you have to just push yourself and change the situation in your favour. When the surgical strikes happened and Pakistani artistes were banned, everyone was sad that our film won’t get made. I wanted to know what happened during the attacks because that sounded like a great story. That switch happened very fast. It is the only way to survive in this industry, it is difficult, you have to be mentally strong. No matter what, you’ve to always keep the josh high,” he said."

Speaking at a meeting on counter-terrorism in New York, Wu Haitao, China’s deputy permanent representative to the UN said frequent cross-border flow of foreign terrorist fighters has caused ever greater harm to international security and stability, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The report defined foreign terrorist fighters as individuals who travel to a state other than their states of residence or nationality for the purpose of participating in terrorist acts.
“The UN and the relevant international agencies should set up counter-terrorism data bases as soon as possible and share intelligence so as to create conditions for effectively curbing the cross-border movement of foreign terrorist nfighters,” he said.
Wu’s speech against the cross border movement for foreign fighters followed Beijing extending the “technical hold” on India’s pending petition to ban Azhar for his involvement in the Pathankot terrorist attack.
Announcing the extension of the technical hold on October 1, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, “China always maintains that on the listing matter, the 1267 Committee should stick to the principles of objectivity, impartiality and professionalism, base its judgments on solid evidence and decide upon consensus among the members of the Security Council”.
China, a veto-wielding member had put a technical hold on the move to impose a ban on Azhar six months ago in the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council (UNSC) comprising of 15 members of the council including the five permanent members.
China was the lone country which put the technical hold at the last minute which drew strong criticism from India.
However China’s stand against movement for foreign terrorists could raise eyebrows in Pakistan as both Azhar and Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed are Pakistanis.
India has been highlighting the cross-border terror threat emanating from Pakistan and tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad are on the rise since last month’s Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir which killed 19 Indian soldiers.
Last month, India and China held their first counter- terrorism dialogue."

As the Indian Army faces one of its biggest attacks on its units in recent times, the Uri terror attack, leaving 17 army jawans dead, has shocked many across the country. While the encounter has ended and four militants have been neutralised, combing operations are still underway. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has held a high-level meeting at his residence which was attended by MHA and MoD officials. Army Chief Dalbir Singh has arrived in Srinagar, while Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will visit Uri later Sunday. Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned the incident in the strongest of words.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the nation that the people behind the Uri attack would be punished. In a series of tweets, PM said the services of those martyred in Uri would never be forgotten. He also extended his condolences to the bereaved families. PM Modi also said that he had spoken to the Home Minister and Defence Minister adding that Parrikar would soon visit Jammu and Kashmir to take stock of the situation.

President Pranab Mukherjee took to Twitter to express his denunciation of the terrorist attack and wrote, “Strongly condemn outrageous terrorist attack on Army base in Uri; tributes to brave soldiers who made supreme sacrifice. Heartfelt condolences to families of those bereaved in Uri terrorist attack; prayers for speedy recovery of injured. India will not be cowed down by such attacks, we will thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their backers.”
Vice president Hamid Ansari expressed deep shock at the terrorist attack and blamed Pakistan for it without naming it. “My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those whose loved ones have been killed”, said Ansari. He said that such attacks were the “result of the use of cross-border terrorism by one particular country in our region. We shall deal with such provocations in a befitting manner.”
Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday slammed Pakistan, saying he was deeply disappointed with that country’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups. “Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolated as such. There are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped.”
Congress Chief Sonia Gandhi called the Uri attack an attack on national conscience. She also said that the perpetrators should be severely dealt with along with the forces behind them. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi expressed his condolences on Twitter saying, “Strongly condemn the militant attack on Army base in Uri. My heartfelt condolences to the families of the bravehearts martyred in the attack.” Speaking to news agency ANI,  Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that his party with the forces who are “the protectors of our nation who keep it united.” Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said that he was “shocked and distressed” by the Uri terror attack. “Salute the jawans.

Continuing their attack on the NDA government, Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh said, “When Pathankot airbase attacked,Parrikar was in Goa, Ordinance factory burnt He was in Goa,Uri Army base attacked he is in Goa.Will TV debate?” Another AAP leader Kumar Vishwas carried out a veiled attack on the government through a couplet posted on Twitter which read, “Bas bhaashan mein zor dikhaana swaabhiman nahi hota. Cake saney haathon se shatru ka sandhan nahi hota.” Loksatta party founder Jayaprakash Narayan said it was time to bury the hatchet and evolve strategy. He also said that Pakistan must choose between self-destruction and prosperity.
CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury issued a statement saying the party condemned the killing of 17 army jawans this morning. It also said that terrorism is not the solution to the kashmir issue and such acts would only compound the situation further. The statement also read: “Pakistan must stop aiding and abetting the extremist forces. Such activities are a big impediment to the peace process in region. The CPI(M) would like to reiterate that for a long withstanding solution of the Kashmir problem, the political dialogue with all stakeholders as advocated by the all Party delegation should be initiated without any further delay.”
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar released an official statement saying he is deeply saddened by the martyrdom

of 17 soldiers in the terror attack at headquarters of 12th Army Brigade near LOC in Uri sector in Jammu and Kashmir.  The statement also read: “Kumar hailed the valour and dedication of the soldiers towards service to the nation by laying down their lives in the terror strike. The country will always remember the supreme sacrifice made by those soldiers attaining martyrdom in the Uri terror attack.”
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also denounced the terrorist killing of 17 soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir and said “India cannot be cowed down by such attacks”. “I strongly condemn the cowardly attack at Uri in which 17 soldiers lost thier lives,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader tweeted. “My heartfelt condolences to the families of those martyred in Uri,” he added.
BJP leader Ram Madhav on Sunday asserted that days of strategic restraint are over and suggested that “for one tooth, the complete jaw” should be the policy after the Uri terror attack. “The Prime Minister has promised that those behind the Uri terror attack will not go unpunished. That should be the way forward. For one tooth, the complete jaw. If terrorism is the instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise,” said Madhav.
Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “We don’t believe that it is a terrorist attack, it is planned attack by Pakistan. No need to talk, now we should take some rigid actions. If it doesn’t stop now people will turn against the government.”
Speaking to reporters, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, “These are challenges to our security.  Pathankot and Uri (terror attacks) appear to indicate that these (fidayeen attacks) have restarted again. And I think this is a major challenge which I am sure our security forces will gear up to respond.”
He said that in recent years there had been an increasing reliance “on activities like stone throwing agitations” which were instigated from across the border. He said the terror attacks “have nothing to do with complexion of the governments in power at the Centre.” Replying to a question, he said, “such (like Uri attack) security situations are handled by security forces… on the basis of political statements, response is not given”. Asked about a recent statement of Pakistan Defence Minister that if the neighbouring country will need to use nuclear weapons for their survival they will, Jaitley said, “This is an irresponsible statement. Such statements are condemnable and the world also does not accept such threats.”
“Like PM Modi said that the ones behind these attacks will not be spared and brought to justice, in an international arena, Pakistan will be isolated if it continues to adopt such measures. It is clear that our neighbour is using terror to create menace in our country, which is also supported by some stone-pelters,” said Arun Jaitley.
NCP leader Majeed Memon on Sunday condemned the Uri attack and questioned the BJP-led NDA regime’s future course of action while dealing with the hostile neighbour. “This would just mean nothing short of external aggression. And I am sure that at this time of grief and test, all political parties and all leaders would stand together side by side along with the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. We would give a befitting reply to Pakistan and to the whole world would sure that how our liberal and flexible approach has been misused by our neighbour,” Memon said. He also said, “We expect that the Prime Minister without the loss of even an hour must come forward and make a very strong condemnatory statement and tell the world that how we have suffered at the hands of our neighbours.”
It is painful, now it is clear from military’s observation that the terrorists were trained in Pakistan. On the diplomatic level we have left the defensive policy and have adopted assertive policy. On the issue of terrorism, no country is standing today with Pakistan, even their trusted allies US is snubbing them. We have raised the issue of Balochistan, so from internal to international angle we have diplomatically cornered Pakistan. The Indian government is taking due consideration of all the aspects and will give a befitting reply to them,” said BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi."

President Vladimir Putin Sunday called on the US-led coalition to avoid civilian casualties in the battle to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State jihadist group.
“We hope that our American partners, and in this case our French partners as well, will act selectively and do everything to minimise — and even better, to rule out –civilian casualties,” Putin said in a televised news conference on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in India.

“We of course are not going to fan hysteria over this matter, like our partners in the West do, because we understand that we need to fight terrorism, and that there is no other way apart from active fighting,” he added. IS seized Mosul along with other areas of Iraq in June 2014, but Iraqi forces have since regained significant ground from the jihadists and — backed by a US-led coalition that includes France — are preparing for an assault to retake the city.
Meanwhile in neighbouring Syria, Russian airpower is currently backing up an offensive by regime forces on rebel-held eastern Aleppo that has sparked accusations of potential war crimes from the West.
More than 370 people, including nearly 70 children, have been killed in regime and Russian bombardment of east Aleppo since the regime’s assault began on September 22, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this week. The launch of the operation to recapture Mosul is expected to be announced soon."

Pakistani participation in the annual PITEX has been a regular feature of the event over the last 10 years.
Watch what else is making news:


This year, it will be held from December 8 to 12 amid a spike in tension following the Uri attack and the Indian “surgical strike” across the LoC, with Nagrota attack being the latest.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Immediately after the attack on the Uri brigade headquarters, Pakistani delegations either stayed away or their participation was cancelled at trade events in Delhi and Chandigarh.
PITEX will come close on the heels of the 6th ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia Conference which was held in this city.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and Sartaj Aziz, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan Prime Minister, were present together at the international conference in which over 40 countries took part. It was the first official delegation from Pakistan to visit India in months, but an anticipated India-Pakistan pull-aside did not happen. Earlier, India had refused to participate in the SAARC summit in Islamabad, leading to the cancellation of the event. But, trade between India and Pakistan has continued despite the escalation at the Line of Control spilling over into several aspects of the bilateral relationship.
“All SAARC countries participate in PITEX. Pakistan will also participate with the other member countries,” said Rathee, stating that there has been nothing so far to suggest that Pakistani traders will not take part this year. “The response from Pakistan traders is the same as it was in previous years,” he added.
The Pak delegates are expected to get their visas from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. “We have communicated to Pakistani traders that they have been cleared to approach the embassy for completion of visa formalities. The papers will be processed in one or two days,” said an official.
An Indian trader said as India-Pakistan trade across the Attari-Wagah border has continued without interruption since the Uri attack, there was no reason why a trade delegation should not visit India.
“Trade between India and Pakistan on Attari-Wagah border has not stopped for even one day after the Uri attack. So, there is nothing unusual if Pakistani traders come and participate at the PITEX. It is not the first time that there is tension between both countries. Show must go on,” said an Indian trader dealing in import-export with Pakistan."

A year that was defined by several judicial and political milestones, 2019 can be called a “watershed moment” in modern Indian history. The year saw scrapping of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcating the state into two Union Territories, Supreme Court order on Ram Temple-Babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya, crimilasing Triple Talaq and clearing the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, which led to massive protests across the country. The year also marked the return and dominance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections.
For the ruling party, the year that began with a campaign blitzkrieg for the general elections, that saw the BJP securing a clear majority on its own — a first for any party in three decades — ended by facing protests against the amended Citizenship Act and being unseated in Jharkhand.

A look at the events that defined 2019:
🔴 Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrike
In one of the deadliest attacks on Indian security forces, about 44 CRPF personnel were killed when an explosive-laden vehicle rammed one of the buses carrying the forces from Jammu to Srinagar on February 14. Following the template of the surgical strikes after the Uri attack in 2016, IAF conducted an airstrike at JeM training camps in Balakot before dawn on February 26.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

A day after the strikes, IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. He downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan before his plane was hit. Varthaman was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. The government had called it a “non-military pre-emptive strike” even as the incident led to further deterioration of ties with Pakistan.

🔴 Return of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister
Becoming the first non-Congress Prime Minister to return to power after a full five-year term, Narendra Modi cemented his image as a strong and decisive leader and a poster boy of Hindutva. The ringing endorsement of BJP and Modi can be gauged by the fact that the party won 303 of 542 seats — surpassing its 2014 numbers — and increased its vote share significantly, from 31 per cent to just under 40 per cent.
Modi’s message and relentless campaign on good governance, nationalism, fighting corruption, ‘teaching Pakistan a lesson’ seem to have echoed on the ground despite the fact that his government stuttered on matters of jobs and the economy. The result has led to further marginalisation of the Congress, the decimation of the Left Front — whose vote share plummetted to 8 per cent from 34 per cent in 2014 — and the decline in the influence of regional satraps.

🔴 Criminalising Triple Talaq
Fulfilling one of the core planks of the BJP, the Parliament passed the instant triple talaq Bill in July, two years after the Supreme Court set aside the practice, calling it un-Islamic. Calling it a historic step, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said passage of the triple talaq bill was a victory of gender justice and would further equality in society.
The Triple Talaq law makes giving instant oral triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence, with provisions of jail term up to three years. The woman is entitled to demand maintenance from her husband for herself and her dependent children under the Act. The Opposition parties, however, protested the bill in the House.

🔴 Scrapping special status of J&K under Article 370
The BJP on August 5 fulfilled another election promise of removing the special status for Jammu and Kashmir by diluting Article 370. Besides, the Parliament also passed the J&K Reorganisation Act, bifurcating the state into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh, which officially came into effect from October 31.
The decision was followed by unprecedented security deployment, detention of political leaders in their homes, including three former chief ministers and the snapping of communication links.
With J&K losing its special status, laws related to property, criminal laws to crucial central laws like Right to Information & Education will be among the many that will be applicable to the Union Territories. Permanent citizens of Jammu and Kashmir recognised as state subjects, cease to have special privileges.

🔴 SC order on Ayodhya case
A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the entire disputed land be handed over to a trust to be constituted for construction of a Ram temple and that Muslims be given five acres of either the acquired land near the site or at “a suitable prominent place in Ayodhya” for building a mosque.
“Today is November 9, the day when the Berlin wall was brought down. Today the Kartarpur Corridor was also inaugurated. Now the Ayodhya verdict, so this date gives us the message to stay united and move forward,” PM Modi said hours after the Supreme Court judgment.

🔴 Citizenship Act triggers protests, violence across country
The passage of the amended Citizenship Bill, that makes Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible for citizenship in India, triggered widespread protests across the country, leading to 26 deaths so far and prompting the government to downplay its narrative on a proposed National Register of Citizens.
Apart from Assam where the protests first began, Uttar Pradesh is the worst-affected state — where at least 14 of the 19 victims are Muslims who died of bullet injuries. The wave of protests began on December 15, when police stormed the Jamia Millia Islamia University campus, leaving over hundreds of students injured.

Following the Uri attack on September 18 and the unsuccessful diplomatic conversations between India and Pakistan, the Defence Ministry on Thursday confirmed to have carried out surgical strikes along the LoC. Reportedly, the military activity has led to significant casualties being caused to terrorists who had established themselves at launchpads along the LoC with an aim to infiltrate and cause terror strikes in Jammu and Kashmir.
This is of course not the first time that the dispute between India and Pakistan has erupted into an armed conflict. Since August 1947 when Partition led to the creation of these two independent countries, disputes, in particular with regard to the claim over Kashmir, have been a consistent feature of the relationship between India and Pakistan. On several occasions the conflict over Kashmir gave way to military attacks. The only other time when Kashmir was not the main issue causing an armed struggle was during the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971.

1947
The first instance of an armed conflict between the two countries was immediately after Independence and Partition in October 1947. The fear of Kashmir acceding to India was what had triggered the struggle. The Pakistani Army infiltrated Kashmir through tribal forces in an attempt to occupy Kashmir. This was followed by the Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh signing the agreement of accession to the dominion of India resulting in a full fledged war between India and Pakistan and the solidification of the Line of Control. Even though the war did not have a conclusive victor, India managed to claim two-thirds of Kashmir, while Pakistan got about a third of the territory.

(Express Archives)
The war of 1965 was a result of Operation Gibralter carried out by Pakistani armed forces to occupy Kashmir. The operation was given the codename Gibralter in an attempt to draw parallels with the Arab invasion of Spain from the port of Gibralter. However, poor coordination of the insurgency led to the failure of the plan and India responded with a full scale armed struggle that continued for the next 17 days. Large number of military vehicles and tanks were used for the purpose and the war saw casualties numbering in thousands by the end of it. The war ended only after the diplomatic intervention of the Soviet Union and the United States.
1971

The war of 1971 was unique in the sense that this time Kashmir was not the bone of contention. It occurred as a result of the ongoing war between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. While India gave full support to East Pakistan’s cause, it formally entered into war with Pakistan after it carried out strikes on forward airbases and radar installations of the Indian Air Force. Occurring over a course of 13 days the war saw the largest number of prisoners of war since World War II. The war resulted in the independence of East Pakistan and the creation of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.

The government is pumping around Rs 1,000 crore in a multi-layered security infrastructure to plug cross-border infiltration on the western front. Not just on land but under water, too.
An indigenous sensor technology that can detect infiltrators under water will be part of an anti-infiltration technical grid that will also include laser walls, ground sensors and thermal imagers at various riverine gaps on the border in Jammu and Punjab, according to Home Ministry officials.

The move is expected to complement massive repair work the government is undertaking of fences on the Punjab border, and assumes significance following the Uri attack on September 18, believed to have been committed by four terrorists who crossed over from Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The security establishment believes that underwater infiltration is a clear possibility as India strengthens its fences and other terrestrial defences, said an official. He said that training on water, including swimming in swift rivers and diving, is part of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) training module and that divers could be used to infiltrate in future.
“Last year, there was an instance where a consignment of heroin was sent from across the border stuffed in a tube and covered with hyacinth. Had it not been for prior intelligence, it would have crossed the border under water,” said the official.
Officials said that the Home Ministry has already sanctioned many border projects while others are under consideration. Some of them, such as the laser walls and underwater sensors, are being developed at the Border Security Force’s Tekanpur facility, they said.
The BSF facility is also working on replacing laser technology with infra-red rays with enhanced capabilities. “Laser rays are visible, infra-red provides a stealth option,” said an official.
“At the moment, they (infra-red rays) are able to cover gaps of only about 100 metres. The BSF is working on increasing it to 500-700 metres so that areas where rivers stretch to more than half-a-kilometre can be secured,” said the official.
The ministry has also sanctioned repair-work on fences and floodlights, which came up in the 1980s, on the Punjab border, the official said. “The repair of about 250 km of the 550 km of border-fencing has been sanctioned. The quality of material chosen for fencing is also better. The existing fencing is made of wrought iron, which is prone to rusting. The new fencing would be of galvanised metal,” said the official.
The ministry has also sanctioned the concretisation of over 800 posts on the border that would grant BSF personnel greater protection from snipers and during ceasefire violations. These posts will also have accommodation facilities.
According to officials, the border posts project alone would cost about Rs 100 crore, while each laser wall would cost about Rs 20,000.
Installing ground sensors would cost about Rs 1 crore per km. With about 750 km of the western border to be covered, the multi-layered technical security infrastructure is likely to cost in excess of Rs 1,000 crore.
Following the Pathankot attack in January, the ministry had ordered an increase in the number of troops on the Punjab border, from 15 to 20 battalions, officials said."

IN A bid to showcase its soft-power diplomacy in war-torn but cricket-loving Afghanistan, the Ministry of External Affairs has decided to invite proposals from filmmakers for a documentary on two of that country’s most popular cricketers: Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi.
Under the working title ‘Afghan Cricketers: The Rising Stars’, the Ministry wants the short movie to be made in English in three formats — a 10-minute complete version; a shorter 5-minute version; and, a 2-minute promo.
Officials said the movie will target the international and domestic audience, and showcase the journey of young leg-spinner Rashid Khan and veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi from the national team to the international platform and in IPL 2017.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
During the IPL auction in February, Nabi became the first Afghan cricketer to enter the Twenty20 league after he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for his base price of Rs 30 lakh. Then, Khan hit the headlines after he was roped in by the same team for Rs 4 crore.
“The treatment and storyline should be fast paced, engaging to watch, cohesive and creatively presented. Narration or an anchor-driven approach may be chosen without long monologues,” an official told The Indian Express.
Officials said the film “should briefly introduce the life of cricketers and after that their rise in cricket, their participation in the IPL auction and selection”.
“It should also showcase the journey of these cricketers from the streets of Afghanistan to the international platform with their excellent performance,” an official said.
“This film will be shot during IPL… video clips from cricket matches and interviews of various cricketers, and the two players and their families, will be included in this film,” the official said.
With archival footage and music score, South Block officials want the rough cut from movie-makers by May 10. “We want to showcase Afghan talent during the IPL season…It means a lot for Afghanistan and India’s relationship,” said the official.
Sources said the government wanted to showcase the “good neighbour” story from Afghanistan.
“The subtle message is to Pakistan…that Pakistan exports terrorism, and that is the reason their players have not been allowed to play in Indian domestic cricket. Whereas Afghanistan, which has suffered terrorism, has exported talented players, and the Indian people and the government are welcoming their participation,” an official said.
Sources said Afghanistan’s ambassador Shaida Abdali; former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Amar Singh, who is now secretary (economic relations) in MEA; current Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Manpreet Vohra; and, official spokesperson Gopal Baglay, who was joint secretary Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were among the key officials who came up with the idea.
The diplomatic and political backdrop of this venture is also relevant since Afghanistan has been supportive of India on isolating Pakistan after the Uri attacks.
Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani was one of the first to call for a boycott of the SAARC summit in Islamabad last year. Ambassador Abdali had also endorsed India’s surgical strikes across the LoC.
“They are Afghanistan’s young brand ambassadors… when people think of Afghans, they don’t just think of Taliban and terrorism, they should think of good cricketers like Rashid and Nabi. And India is helping us create that brand image,” said an Afghan diplomat."

Two Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists posing as guides in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir were arrested by the Army on Saturday, according to NDTV.
According to reports in ANI, in a joint operation by the Army and Border Security Force (BSF), two PoK nationals were apprehended on September 21. During the investigation, the individuals have revealed their identities as Ahasan Kursheed @ DC, s/o Mohd Kursheed of Khaliana Kalan and Faisal Hussain Awan s/o Gul Akbar of Pottha Jahangir both in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.
The duo was recruited two years ago by the JeM and was guiding terrorists to infiltrate across the line of control.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The details provided by them are being examined and corroborated by the concerned agencies.
This development comes seven days after deadly attacks by terrorists in Uri which killed 18 soldiers. The heavily armed terrorists targeted the rear administrate base of a unit at Uri, Kashmir. Four militants were also killed in the encounter.
The relations between India and Pakistan took a hit after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, but the relations reached an all-time low following the Uri attack."

It seems like there is no end to the controversy brewing around the ban on Pakistani actors demanded by the MNS in the aftermath of Uri attacks. At the Bridge Talks held in New Delhi on Saturday, ace choreographer and director Farah Khan, in a conversation with The Express Group’s Executive Director Anant Goenka, said she would “prefer having someone from my country in my movies.”

The Bridge Talks is a new initiative by The Caravan to facilitate conversations on some of the most pressing issues of our times. While talking on gender empowerment, Farah said it would be unfair to ban films such as Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (starring Fawad Khan) and Raees (with Mahira Khan in lead), which have already been finished. However, said Farah, from now on the industry should focus on working with actors from our own country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I think there are a handful people, not even handful but may be two people we are talking about. They are not important in the scheme of things. When they did those movies, it wasn’t illegal to have Pakistani actors working in Indian movies. The movies were shot at considerable expense and hardwork, I don’t think it is fair to ban those movies. I think from now on, if you are saying we should not work with them, I say we have enough talent in our country and we should work with people from our country. What do we don’t have that they have? I think we are far better. So, we would work with our people. I would definitely prefer to take somebody from my country for my movies,” Farah said at the event.

Earlier, Nana Patekar also voiced his opinion on the Pakistani actors ban. He said, “I don’t know anything else other than my country. An artiste is very small in front of a country. As artistes, we don’t have value when it comes to country,” said Patekar during an interaction with the media earlier.

MNS chief Raj Thackeray had earlier raised a similar point, demanding to know if India had a short supply of artistes and what is the need of Pakistani artistes to work in Indian films. “I don’t understand. Jawans are fighting for us at borders.What’ll happen if they decide to put down their weapons? Who’ll guard our borders? Salman Khan? These artists should realise ‘Nation first’. If they have so much problem, we will ban their movies too,” he said.
At least three major films, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Fawad Khan, Raees starring Mahira Khan and Dear Zindagi with Ali Zafar are slated for release over the next few weeks. The MNS objection has reportedly created a huge hurdle in terms of pre-release promotional activities, cinema hall bookings and related issues."

At 26, Sepoy Harinder Yadav supported a family that included his wife, two sons, parents, four elder and a younger brothers and their families. He was the only one with a government job.
“Our four elder brothers work as labourers in Rajasthan and other places,” said Nagendra, the youngest brother. “I stay at home. Harinder’s wife and children also live in the village. Though our family is large, he always tried to keep us together. He had given me his ATM card a few years ago.” The family owns six bighas agricultural land.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Nagendra last spoke to Harinder Saturday. “He had called around 1 pm and asked how everyone in the family was. He said he will be going to the mountains and will not be able to talk for a few days. He asked me to check the account balance on September 22 to get money. On Sunday, we got a call that he had been killed,” he said.
Harinder had joined the Army in 2007 and got married in 2011. He is survived by two sons, Rohit, 4, and Raj, 2.
Nagendra said that Harinder had been trying to get him recruited in the Army and he had appeared for physical tests four times."

Saying that the days of “restraint” are over, two senior BJP leaders associated with J&K on Sunday called for a decisive response to the terror attack in Uri.
“For one tooth, the complete jaw,” wrote Ram Madhav, the BJP general secretary and the party’s pointsman for the state, on his Facebook page.

“The Prime Minister has promised that those behind the Uri terror attack will not go unpunished. That should be the way forward. For one tooth, the complete jaw,” Ram Madhav wrote.

Asserting that “the days of so-called strategic restraint are over”, he said, “If terrorism is the instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise.”
BJP president Amit Shah said India’s fight against terrorism had reached a “decisive stage” and the Modi government was moving in the right direction. “Pakistan is trying to cause instability in India by constantly trying to lend support to terrorism and terrorist outfits. India has been constantly fighting against terrorism and this fight is now at a decisive stage,” he said in a statement.

Shah also lamented “the martyrdom of the brave sons of India” and said he prayed for their souls to rest in peace.
Calling the Uri terror attack “a disturbing moment and a moment of introspection”, MoS Singh said, “We have known long enough who are behind sponsoring terrorism against India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. I think the time has come to call their bluff and give them a befitting reply… I am not one bit in favour of responding with cowardice… I think simply calling it an act of cowardice does not suffice, because not responding would also be cowardice… Those who tend to put India’s security or India’s confidence to test would be given a befitting response.”

Both Madhav and Singh refrained from naming Pakistan in their statements. Refusing to specify what a “befitting” response would be, Singh said, “I don’t have to spell out that in public. I am sure the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs would come out with an effective strategy.”

Federation of Western India CIne Employees (FWICE) on Sunday released a statement, advising Indian artistes to follow its non-cooperation directive against working with Pakistani artistes. The film body warned that violators would be subjected to disciplinary action.
Since the Uri attack in 2016, FWICE, along with many other film bodies, imposed a ban on Pakistani artistes. Since the lockdown, there have been a few cross-border online collaborations among artistes.
In its press release, FWICE cites a collaboration of some Indian artistes (without naming them) with Pakistani musician Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are pained to inform all members that despite being fully aware that FWICE has issued a total non-cooperation circular advising all members not to work in any manner whatsoever with all Pakistani artistes, singers and technicians.
“Some members are blatantly violating the non-cooperation circular by working in various mode and media of Entertainment like a recent instance in which our musicians have worked online with singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan of Pakistan which is being seen online and we have been informed that more such entertainment products and songs are being planned and made,” the statement read.
The press release said that while the whole world is united in its fight against coronavirus, Pakistan is “busy killing our soldiers on the border”, and the Indian artiste community should not forget it.
“We have to strictly inform all the members of our affiliates to kindly note that the Non- Cooperation Circular is valid and subsisting and anyone found cooperating or working in any manner with any Pakistani artistes, singers and technicians, in any mode or media of Entertainment will be subject to strict disciplinary action initiated by FWICE which everyone may please note.
“One should also realize that while the entire world is fighting against the coronavirus, Pakistan is still busy killing our soldiers on the borders. Kindly note no violation of this circular will be allowed and we are sure all members will follow our advice in their own interest,” the statement concluded."

The audacious terror attack on a brigade headquarters in Uri in the early hours of Sunday, September 18, that resulted in the death of 17 Indian soldiers and injured over 20 troops is a very serious operational lapse. That four armed terrorists could kill so many soldiers in a fortified army camp is an illustration of the asymmetrical advantage that has progressively accrued to the adversary.
The loss of uniformed personnel in this manner against a determined and opaque adversary in the proximity of the LoC (Line of Control) draws attention to two interlinked issues: The complexity of the proxy war that Indian security forces have been dealing with in Jammu and Kashmir for 26 years and the chinks that the enemy is able to periodically exploit with impunity.

The Uri attack follows Pathankot in January 2016 and the Indian security establishment will have to conduct the most rigorous internal review to identify tactical lapses that may have led to attacks of this nature. In both cases, armed terrorists/covert troops were able to enter fortified military camps. If some degree of insider collusion is established, then the nature of the challenge gets that much more tangled for the security forces. In relation to the Sunday attack, Uri, it may be noted, is about 20 km inside the LoC and hence the army will have to introspect candidly to introduce the necessary correctives.
The Indian response to the Uri attack has followed a familiar pattern of anger against the adversary, the state-sponsored terrorist — and the “deep state” represented by the Pakistan military. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has castigated Pakistan, called it a “terrorist state” and imprudently canceled his visit to the US and Russia. PM Modi has assured the nation that the perpetrators of this “despicable attack” will be punished. The dominant question that has been deliberated upon with anger and anguish across the audio-visual medium and in social media over the last 24 hours is: “When?”

Delhi’s response to the proxy war that began in January 1990, when Pakistan embarked upon its strategy of low-intensity-conflict (LIC) against India by supporting terror groups, has been tenaciously defensive. Operationally, this posture is inherently disadvantageous and costly, as the last 26 years have demonstrated. The adversary who is committed to audacious offensive initiatives has to succeed occasionally to claim victory, while zero-error in “defending” against every covert terror attack, or its variant, is a statistical oxymoron.
India’s strategic culture has been one of defensive diffidence despite the emphatic military victory of 1971, and the regional geo-political orientation has been exploited to the hilt by Pakistan. Consequently, the prevailing politico-diplomatic context wherein Rawalpindi, the GHQ of the Pakistan military, receives varying degrees of support from the major powers, constrains Indian options.

The US, even while being a victim of Pakistani perfidy, continues to pay treasure to Rawalpindi and in an inexplicable policy contradiction, the Pentagon is willing to be paid back in the blood of American troops. But as Delhi knows to its chagrin, US policy in relation to Pakistani support of terror groups will only go that far and the White House continues to turn a blind eye to the kind of transgressions that led to the US war against Iraq in 2003: A deviant regime using nuclear weapons as a shield to enable terror.
China’s uncritical support to the Pakistan military and the depth of the strategic cooperation is unprecedented in recent history. No other state has been enabled in such a manner in the acquisition of nuclear weapon know-how and missile technology and China has been inexplicably generous to Rawalpindi. Beijing’s reluctance to censure Pakistan in relation to terror has already been demonstrated in the UN and this is unlikely to change — unless China becomes victim to its own 9/11 trauma.

It is this global politico-diplomatic tilt in its favour that allows Rawalpindi to act with the impunity and audacity associated with its actions — from Kargil in 1999 and Mumbai 2008 to Uri now. Furthermore, the August 15 Modi initiative over Balochistan has clearly encouraged Pakistan to intensify the three-pronged offensive against India. Delhi will have to internalise the lessons learnt (or not learnt?) over the last three decades and find the most effective harmonisation of resolve and restraint in the face of such sustained provocation.
Uri is the military illustration of the Pak offensive and in all likelihood, the long drawn out proxy war will enter a phase of more such attempts that will have to be thwarted — each time. The second strand — the diplomatic offensive — has been revived, and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif will go hammer and tongs at the UN General Assembly to project Kashmir as a victim of Indian oppression and Pakistan as the victim being intimidated for providing “moral support” to the “freedom fighters”.
The third prong of the Pakistani offensive is the narrative-cum-perception about India and Kashmir that has been assiduously irrigated at every global forum. In today’s politico-military environment, while ensuring an operational military advantage is imperative, winning the “story” is equally if not more important — especially in LIC and proxy war exigencies. Here, India has a chequered track record in relation to how it has dealt with the Kashmir issue over the years — and the political management of the Burhan Wani-related violence and turmoil in the Valley have not helped matters.
Post Uri, and the righteous national anger that is palpable, India will need to avoid the temptation of falling into the trap of impulsive indignation whenever Pakistan plays the terror card. The pressure on the Modi government to act decisively “now” is visible but this should be tempered by objective cost-benefit operational analysis.
Politically, India must acquire the steely resolve to increase the cost to the adversary and the need for political consensus on such national imperatives is critical. Uri should not be allowed to become a divisive issue in the domestic debate and the Modi government must also demonstrate that its recent initiatives in relation to Pakistan have been well thought through — and that all likely exigencies have been anticipated."

Sport and politics should not be mixed in an ideal world but in reality it can’t happen in certain cases, feels champion shooter Abhinav Bindra amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of Uri terror attack.
“At the end of the day, it is the decision of the government. It takes the final call on whether a team can play (against Pakistan) and that call has to be respected,” Bindra told PTI today.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
So does he feel that politics and sport should be kept separate?
“It is a very difficult question. One would hope for that to happen (that sport and politics is not mixed). It is a nice thought it should be separated because that is the Olympic values as well that sport should be free from politics. But today, in reality, it doesn’t happen sometimes. One has to take a call from situation to situation and the government’s decision has to be respected,” said India’s only individual Olympic gold medallist.
The Indian government has stepped up its efforts to isolate Pakistan globally on all fronts post the Uri attack and it has also impacted the sporting ties between the two neighbours with the BCCI outrightly ruling out resumption of cricketing ties and Pakistan’s Kabaddi team not taking part in the ongoing World Cup in Ahmedabad.
Bindra, here for the Franchise India Expo, also spoke about his life post Rio Olympics in August, when he ended his glorious career with a fourth place finish.

The 34-year-old has not touched the rifle since the 10m Air Rifle Final in August. He is busy trying to earn a living, as he often puts it these days, and is excited about his business venture of micro high performance centres across India.
The first centre, that helps athletes prepare for mental and physical aspect of their sport, was opened in Mohali earlier in the month.
Is he liking his post retirement life and does he intend to ‘hobby shoot’ once in a while?
“I was already a hobby shooter the last five years so no more of that. I am quite busy actually, trying to earn a living. I go to work every day, it is a different life but it is fine. I like it,” said Bindra.
He has been openly critical about issues plaguing Indian sports. In a column analysing India’s dismal performance in Rio, he had suggested drastic steps for the nation to become a sporting power.
Not much is known about how India plans to prepare for the future Summer Games other than the announcement of a task-force for the next three Olympics. Bindra is open to being part of the task-force though he is yet to be approached for the job.
“It is a tough question for me now (where does India stand right now). Simply because I am not involved in sport anymore on a daily basis. When I was an active athlete, I would see it from a different eye. I was more into it. Since Rio, I am not an athlete anymore so I don’t know what exactly is happening on the ground,” Bindra said.
“It will be unfair of me to comment on it and I can only hope that there is a lot of action happening. That we are progressing towards athlete development, towards not just Tokyo 2020 but we must already look at 2024 and beyond, set structures and processes in place which would create a feeder line of athletes,” he said.
He was very clear that Indian sport won’t improve unless a legislation is passed in the parliament.
“I have said this before. In India for things to change, the change will have to be mandated. Unfortunately nobody likes change, there is a lot of resistance to change. But change is necessary. I think in the structure of sport in India, if it is mandated, that is the only way forward. For that to happen, a legislation in sport is important,” he said referring to the proposed Sports Bill.
Asked whether the Sports Bill will be a reality anytime soon? “I am not in charge of that so I can’t say (when it will happen). I can only take a guess and it would be no,” Bindra said on a lighter note.
Drawing a parallel from the current happenings in Indian cricket, which could change forever if the Lodha panel’s recommendations on the governance of the game are implemented, Bindra was asked if Supreme Court intervention would also help streamline other sports bodies.
“At the end of the day, you have got to have the right person for the right job. If a politician can bring an X amount to the table and do well for the sport, he is more than welcome in my view. Running sport is a full time job, it requires a lot of effort, it requires an efficient set up. If a politician can deliver (on all fronts), more power to him. It all boils down to efficiency, performance and accountability,” he concluded."

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj won accolades and appreciation in India for the fiery speech she delivered at United Nations General Assembly on Monday. Leaders across the party lines and also the Indian media lauded her for sending a clear message to neighboring Pakistan that it cannot continue with its policy of supporting terrorism and also reiterating India’s stand on Kashmir.
However, media in India and Pakistan has been reporting the incidents and exchanges between both the countries since the killing of Burhan Wani and escalation of tension in Kashmir, in a rather contrasting manner.

If we look at how Pakistan dailies covered Sushma Swaraj’s UNGA address on Monday, it is found that most of them decided to not give it enough attention as PM Narendra Modi’s review meeting on Indus Waters Treaty made headlines on front pages of most newspapers.
Apart from that, General Raheel Shareef’s statement in which he claimed that India’s intelligence agency R&AW was involved in ‘spilling blood of innocent citizens’ also grabbed space.
India’s move to take Indus Waters Treaty – brokered by World Bank – in consideration seems to have created ripples in Pakistan. Here is how the Pakistani media covered it:

The Express Tribune targeted PM Narendra Modi and his attempts to pressurise Islamabad post Uri attack and said: “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reaction post-Uri assault has been full of flip flops. Now he is threatening to undo the only achievement that has withstood periods of tensions and conflict between the two arch foes.”

“Modi’s threat to run Pakistani rivers dry shows his utter desperation and naivety,” it added.

The Pakistan Observer stressed on the fact that Indus Waters Treaty could not be altered with or scrapped by any one nation unilaterally. “The Indus Waters Treaty signed between Pakistan and India and brokered by World Bank in 1960 is a sacred document and India cannot even change comma, full stop and hyphen unilaterally as big economies are guarantors of treaty,” it said.
The paper also gave ample space to General Raheel’s statement on RAW, running it as second lead on the front page of newspaper.

Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday took a strong exception to some politicians raising questions about the surgical strikes against terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) after the Uri attack.
Speaking at a book release function in New Delhi, Naidu said that it is unfortunate that some politicians are speaking the language of Pakistan about the surgical strikes carried out by the brave Indian Jawans.

“We saw today some political leaders speaking the language of Pakistan. Such politicians don’t realise the consequences of their irresponsible talks, it shows their lack of confidence in our jawans,” he said.
He said, such type of irresponsible talks only reflect their lack of confidence in Indian security forces.
The Union Minister said India needs to stand united against the forces disturbing socio-economic fabrics of the country.
“The nation needs to stand together. It is not fair to ask our jawans to show proof of their operations against terrorists,” he said.

Left behind in the rubble at Nagrota, the detritus of a fidayeen: An assault rifle, ammunition, injectable painkillers, and, incongruously, a small bottle of cheap, yellow ittar. The terrorist who carried these things, we know from the testimonies of others, would have risen early that morning, bathed, prayed, and shaved himself from head to foot. He’d have darkened his eyes with kohl, like a traditional bridegroom, and then perfumed himself, so he did not stink of war when the houris he had been promised greeted him inside the gates of heaven.
The mother of one such fidayeen, Imran Majid Butt, wrote this poem: “I wait for the day, O’Allah, when you will call out: ‘Who is the mother of this blood-drenched rose?’”

Ever since September’s strike on the 12th Brigade’s headquarters in Uri set the Line of Control ablaze, and brought India and Pakistan closer to war than they have been since 2002-2003, the cult of the fidayeen has seared itself on our public discourse as never before. India, it’s been claimed, is facing a grim new kind of war. Facts, though, tell another story: Fidayeen warfare is, in fact, a sideshow, militarily ineffective and strategically marginal to the jihadist insurgency in Kashmir. The cult of the fidayeen is about dying, not killing. The hysteria we now see, both in the media and among policymakers, is precisely the end it is intended to secure.
The Lashkar’s fidayeen war began in 1999, soon after the end of the Kargil war: To the jihadist movement, it signalled that Pakistan’s military defeat was not a reason to lose heart. That July, a single Lashkar fidayeen entered the Border Security Force’s sector headquarters at Bandipora, and proceeded to hold off an assault involving the elite, but tactically unsound, National Security Guard for three days. In November, that year, two Lashkar fidayeen stormed the 15 Corps’ headquarters in Srinagar’s Badami Bagh, killing eight soldiers.
“I announce the breakup of India, inshallah,” Lashkar chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed said soon afterwards, addressing an ecstatic crowd of over 250,000 people at the terrorist group’s annual congregation in Muridke. “We will not rest until the whole of India is dissolved into Pakistan”.
Even though the fidayeen became emblematic of the post-Kargil insurgency in Kashmir — a campaign that claimed the lives of more Indian soldiers than the war itself — its actual impact was less-than-spectacular. From 1999 to 2003, the most intense phase, fidayeen attacks claimed some 200 of the over 5,000 lives lost in Kashmir. Less than half of those fatalities were of security force personnel, a small percentage of the over 1,300 soldiers and police personnel who laid down their lives during those years.
Little has, in fact, changed. This year has seen dramatic losses to fidayeen strikes: Thirty five security force personnel killed — in comparison, 12 terrorists claimed to have been shot dead. However, the bulk of those losses came at Uri, where an official investigation has shown that most of the casualties were caused not by the attack, but by carelessly-stored fuel. In Pampore, where eight Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed inside a bus, the major fatalities were caused by ill-trained men shooting their comrades in the back. These incidents, the data shows, were outliers: Overall, from 2005 to now, fidayeen attacks have claimed just 107 of the 1,044 soldiers and police personnel killed, while 77 attackers lost their lives. Last year, 13 fidayeen were killed for the loss of three security force personnel.
It’s hard to say precisely what led so many young men to volunteer to die for the Lashkar’s cause. Few, we know, were ethnic Kashmiri; the bulk came from Pakistan’s Punjab. Their backgrounds were diverse: while the 26/11 attacker Muhammad Ajmal Kasab never went to secondary school, Imran Butt graduated from a college in Sialkot. In one of the few empirically robust studies of the Lashkar’s cadre, C. Christine Fair concluded the average Lashkar operative was better educated and less steeped in conventional religious learning than the population as a whole.
Anecdotal evidence exists that many of the fidayeen had past records of criminal behaviour: Through the sacrifice of their lives, they may believe that their lives acquired redemption. The scholar Ayesha Siddiqa has suggested jihadism might be one of few means for young men in rural Pakistan to find agency and self-respect, however perverse, in otherwise meaningless lives. “I met some young boys from my village near Bahawalpur who were preparing to go on jihad,” she wrote. “They smirked politely when I asked them to close their eyes and imagine their future: ‘We can tell you without closing our eyes that we don’t see anything’”.
In the camps, the fidayeen were taught to to see themselves as angels of vengeance. “Today,” Imran Butt wrote in a parting letter to his mother, “the kafir tests our self-respect by humiliating us, by tearing down our mosques. The kafir plays with the honour of our mothers and sisters while we silently watch. I find it intolerable. I want to cut open the kafir’s jugular to quench my anger. I want to keep doing so until the day comes when my Master cools my breast and makes Islam victorious.”
C.M. Naim, in a superb essay on the Lashkar’s propaganda, noted that while these atrocities were indeed part of Jammu and Kashmir’s reality, “the jihadi concern with sexual exploitation of Muslim women by non-Muslims has a history too. It is the obligatory motif in their literature in South Asia, invoked with reference to both Muhammad bin Qasim’s attack on Sindh (eighth century) and the jihad of Syed Ahmad of Rae Bareli (19th century) against the Sikhs”.
Late in the 11th century, the mystic Hassan Ibn al-Sabbah set up the first fidayeen order, to wage war on the Seljuk empire. The historian Amin Maalouf has perceptively noted that their killings were “intended primarily as a twofold lesson for the public: First, the punishment of the victim and, second, the heroic sacrifice of the executioner.”
The fidayeen war is performance theatre, each act competing with the last to gain our attention through acts of ever-increasing terror."

It was a sombre Dussehra celebration this year than what we usually witness. Before the celebrating the triump of good over evil, those who had gathered at the Sector 46 ground paid homage to the martyrs who lost their lives in the recent Uri attack. Soon after that, Tricity’s tallest Raavan installed at 85-feet went up in flames on Tuesday.
Not only in Sector 46, Dussehra was celebrated at 37 locations in the city, the major ones being at Sector 17, 27,32,29 and Manimajra. Festive spirit engulfed the city as people thronged the venues in large numbers to have a glimpse of the effigy burning ceremony. Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore who was the Chief Guest at Sector 46, also attended three other celebrations at Sector 17,46 and 48 in Chandigarh and exchanged greetings with people and organisers.
To mark the festival, four drones were arranged which showered flowers at the guests and visitors. Not only this, TV sets were arranged in the markets so that people who could not come to the venue could witness the event being aired live on some channels. Around Rs 80 lakhs were spent to mark the festival in the Tricity. Amid all this, the government’s ‘Swachh Bharat Campaign’ too took a backseat as revelers busted crackers and threw litter at the venues. Meanwhile in sector 27, the effigies were set on pyre through a remote control.Chandigarh NewsTika Utsav concludes, Punjab fails to hit its daily target even onceSukhbir promises Dalit deputy CM if voted to power, BJP the CM post3,329 fresh cases, 63 more deaths in PunjabClick here for more

Amid growing strain in Indo-Pak ties, government is planning to fast-track four projects in Indus river basin to increase irrigation area in Jammu and Kashmir by nearly 2.05 lakh acres, weeks after India decided to “exploit to the maximum” the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per Indus Water Treaty (IWT). Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last month chaired a meeting to review the 56-year-old IWT in the aftermath of the Uri attack, asserting that “blood and water cannot flow together.”

Of these four projects, three –Tral Irrigation Project in Pulwama, Prakachik Khows Canal in Kargil and restoration and modernisation of main Ravi Canal in Jammu’s Sambha and Kathua– are expected to be completed by this fiscal. The fourth project of Rajpora Lift Irrigation is planned to be completed by December 2019.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While the first three projects will help irrigate around 1.45 lakh acres of land. The Rajpora Lift Irrigation is expected to help irrigat around 59,305 acres of land. All these works are expected to cost Rs 117 crore for which money will be raised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).
“Until now, as per the J&K records, seven lakh acres of land is irrigated in the state. This is a very small number. So, the government is trying to complete work on these projects to increase the size of total irrigated area in the state,” sources said.
The sources said technically India can irrigate up to 13 lakh acres of land in Jammu and Kashmir. This target, they said, can be achieved when optimum storage capacity is achieved in the state.
“The projects are being developed well within rights of India and in no way will affect flow of water to Pakistan,” they said.
Taking a tough stand in the aftermath of Uri attack by Pakistan-based terrorists, the government had on September 27 decided to “exploit to the maximum” water of Pakistan-controlled three Western rivers — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum –as per the IWT at the review meeting headed by Modi.
It was also decided to set up an inter-ministerial task forces to go into the details and working of the Treaty with a “sense of urgency” apart from agreeing to review the “unilateral suspension” of 1987 Tulbul navigation project in 2007 by India.
However, sources maintained that the projects were part of government’s efforts to irrigate larger swaths across the country by completing small/medium 99 irrigation projects under ambitious Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKYS) and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) and have nothing to do with the Uri incident and aggression along LoC.
“These (projects) were already worked out. But we do want to bring optimum land under irrigated area as per the deadlines worked out,” they said.
Asked if the tense situation in the state, especially after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani and ensuing protests, has affected pace of the works, the sources said, “The deadline may vary here and there a little. But the government hopes to complete the project works on time.”
The Union Government had launched the PMKYS last year with an aim to enhance physical access to water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc through major and minor irrigation projects.
The AIBP was launched in 1996-97 to provide central assistance to major/minor irrigation projects in the country with an objective to accelerate implementation of such programmes. Since its inception, 143 projects have been completed under AIBP."

(Express photo)
BJP national General Secretary Ram Madhav on Sunday claimed that the footprint of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack on an army camp in North Kashmir’s Uri town was clear and the days of strategic restraint were over.
“The footprint of involvement of Pakistan in the attack is clear. Pakistan has become a problem not just for India but for the entire world,” he told reporters here condemning the attack. “We feel that time for strategic restraint is over. We need to tackle this menace with a firm hand. We need to take proactive measures and that is why our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has said that the perpetrators behind the attack should not go unpunished,” he said.
The BJP leader said, “Terrorism is the policy of cowards. In this case, the footprint of involvement of our neighbour is there. They have been using terrorism as a state policy. I am confident that the issue will be taken up seriously in the upcoming UN General Assembly. Countries all over the world are realising that most of global terrorist attacks are from the soil of Pakistan.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Later, addressing a seminar ahead of the three-day BJP National Executive Council Meet, schedule for next week, he said the Prime Minister has promised that those behind the attack will not go unpunished.
“We are more proactive wherever it is possible. We are no longer strategically restrained,”, he said. “Under Modi’s leadership, we have a foreign policy which is pragmatic. Our Prime Minister does not believe in reforming but transforming our nation as a world power.”
“Our interest forms part of our foreign policy now. Earlier, it was government to government or government to business relations. But this government added some more pillars to the foreign policy,” he said. It was the duty of the government that the dignity of India and every Indian was respected everywhere in the world, he said.
“Today we realise culture has a role to play in international relationships. Culture as a diplomatic tool is what we added to India’s foreign policy,” the BJP leader said."

In the aftermath of the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army along the LoC, there has been an escalation in ceasefire violation by Pakistan and terrorist attacks have taken place in several districts in Jammu and Kashmir. India conducted surgical strikes against the terrorist launch pads along the LoC in response to the Uri attack which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers.

Here’s a ready what all has happened after the surgical strikes:
June 27, 2018: Video clips of the September 29 operation were broadcast on several TV channels on Wednesday, for the first time. These clips showed some terrorists being killed, besides destruction of bunkers and other military constructions. TV channels claimed these videos, which they had accessed from official sources, were taken by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Thermal Imaging (TI) cameras used by the Army to monitor the operation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
October 21, 2016: Seven Pakistani Rangers were killed by the Border Security Force, in retaliation to the ceasefire violation by Pakistan at the International Border in Kathua, J&K. The security personnel also neutralised a terrorist trying to infiltrate across the border. One BSF Jawan was injured in firing from Pakistan side earlier in the afternoon.
October 20, 2016: Three days after killing an Indian Army jawan in snippet fire from across the Line of Control in Tarkundi area of Balakote sector in Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistani troops resorted to intense mortar shelling and small arms fire on the Indian side on Wednesday evening.
October 18, 2016: An Army jawan was killed as Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire and mortar shelling in Balakote and Nowshera areas Sunday. The firing from Pakistani side took place after a lull of nearly 10 days. The dead jawan was identified as Sudesh Kumar, who was deployed at Tarkundi in Balakote area. Sources said that he was hit by sniper fire from across the Line of Control in the evening.
October 16, 2016: Pakistan troops violated the ceasefire in Nowshera town of Jammu and Kashmir. According to news agency ANI, no Indian casualties have been reported so far. Reportedly, a gunbattle is underway along with intermittent firing from Pakistan’s side.
October 3, 2016: Pakistani troops resorted to mortar shelling at Shahpur on Indian side of the Line of Control in Poonch district on Monday. The mortar shelling which started around 11.15 am was continuing.
October 3, 2016: Terrorists launched attack near a camp of the 46 Rashtriya Rifles in Baramulla late on Sunday night. A BSF jawan was martyred while another has been injured in the attack. The army and J&K police’s Special Operations Group personnel conducted search operations in the area around the army camp. “Terrorists tried to enter the camp but our forces retaliated and the terrorists fled, search operations continue,” IG BSF (Kashmir) Vikas Chandra said.
October 2, 2016:  In another ceasefire violation, Pakistani troops launched firing and shelling on forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Pallanwala sector of Jammu district Sunday evening. “Firing and shelling from across LoC has started at 1915 hours in forward areas in Pallanwala belt along the LoC. It is intermittently going on,” a Police officer
September 30, 2016: Pakistani troops resorted to mortar shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) in Pallanwalla sector of Akhnoor, J&K during the wee hours of Saturday. Pointing out that these villagers had been staying at their native places despite heightened tension along the borders, sources said that the mortar shelling started around 3 am and it continued till 8 am. However, there had been no loss of life or damage to property on the Indian side.

September 29, 2016: Pakistani troops resorted to small arms fire at Chapriyal and Samwan under the jurisdiction of Jourian police post along the Line of Control (LoC) in Akhnoor sector late on Thursday night. The firing, which started around 12.30 am, lasted for an hour. However, there had been no loss of life or property.
The strikes invited reactions from within the country and from the international community and affected the course of many events. Here is a break up of all that was affected by the surgical strikes conducted by India.

In India
Leaders from various parties supported the Centre with Congress president Sonia Gandhi saying her party stands with the government on the strikes. AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi said his party stood in solidarity with armed forces and the country in the wake of the “surgical strikes”.
Lauding the armed forces and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “surgical strikes”, BJP leaders maintained that it was a preemptive strike for defence in an area “where India has every right to defend.” BJP president Amit Shah said the strikes indicated the rise of a “new India”, as the country has given a “clear response” to militants.
The strikes rang in with a wave of happiness across the country, with many prominent figures condoning it, emphasising how it was the need of the hour and the best action against terrorists. Families of some Uri martyrs also condoned the attack, saying their martyrdom has been honoured.
In Punjab and Kashmir, villages falling within ten kilometres of the International border were asked to vacate their homes soon after the strikes. in view of the escalating situation. All border schools have been shut for the time being even though military experts termed the action premature.
Villagers had to leave their crops which was especially crucial for them as the time to harvest them was near. The villages have also been evacuated in order to plant land mines in the area for any infiltrators who may come in from across the border. The Aam Aadmi Party also alleged that the evacuation was only causing panic among the villagers and not doing anything fruitful.
After the surgical strikes, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association also passed a resolution to ban Pakistani actors from the industry in the wake of the Uri attack.
Geopolitical tension got the better of the market as the Sensex plunged over 465 points — the biggest single-day fall in 3 months — after the strikes. The intra-day plunge was even higher at 573 points, but some bargain-buying at lower levels helped the index settle higher than the day’s low of 27,719.92. The rupee too was caught in the crossfire, sharply down 39 paise against the US dollar, at 66.85.
In Pakistan
Pakistan, in response, vehemently denied India’s claims of the strike, calling it a ‘farce’. Pakistan also informed UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon that the news of surgical strikes is false. It has, however, not condemned the Uri attack in spite of being prodded by US and UN.
Internationally
The SAARC summit which was to be held in Islamabad has been cancelled after many nations chose to back out of it. The backing out started with India and was followed by Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan. Pakistan eventually postponed the summit and on Sunday, Nepal, the current chair of the SAARC, cancelled it."

With India and Pakistan ready to become members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif expected in the Kazakh capital Thursday, New Delhi and Islamabad, The Indian Express has learnt, will be taking steps towards a one-of-a-kind cooperation by committing to “joint military exercises” under the rubric of counter-terrorism cooperation. While Indian and Pakistani military officials have served together under the United Nations flag, this will be a rare occasion — when that happens — to conduct joint military exercises along with other SCO countries — China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. By joining the SCO, the two countries will be part of the Tashkent-based Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) which conducts such exercises.
READ: PM Narendra Modi leaves for Kazakhstan to attend SCO summit
Iskander Akylbayev, senior research fellow at the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies in Astana, and one of Kazakhstan’s leading experts on SCO, told The Indian Express: “There are certain concerns, specifically how India and Pakistan will cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism. Both states have a long tradition of mistrust and rivalry on diverse array of issues… limited counter-terrorism cooperation under the SCO umbrella is possible… yet both states will prefer multilateral rather bilateral form of military exercises.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Parallel to the Bishkek Summit, the first SCO military exercise Peace Mission-2007 was held in the southern Urals. The militaries of all SCO members participated in this nine-day exercise which focused on counter-terror operations. It involved 6,500 soldiers, including some 2,000 from Russia and 1,700 from China, smaller company-size units from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, a special police platoon from Kyrgyzstan, and a team of 20 Uzbek military officers. About 500 combat vehicles and 80 combat aircraft from China and Russia were also deployed.
Opinion: India should utilise Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, but it must sidestep ambushes by China and Pakistan
“The dominance of Russia and China was evident in the exercise,” said Meena Singh Roy, a senior fellow at Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). A similar exercise took place again in 2009 under Peace Mission-2009.
Both Modi and Sharif are expected to land on Thursday and then attend a banquet hosted by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The rivalry between the two countries is a talking point that is bothering both experts and officials.
Alexander Lukin, who is Director, Center for East Asian and SCO Studies, MGIMO-University (Moscow State Institute of International Relations under the Russian Foreign Ministry), said, “India and Pakistan are going to join. This will seriously transform the organisation. It will be much more representative, the largest regional organisation in the world. One would not be able to describe it as Russia and China dominated or a club of dictators. There is also a hope that a new push will be given to economic cooperation which is not very active at the moment, as well as to solving the problems of Afghanistan.”
With all eyes set on a possible pull-aside between Modi and Sharif in this gleaming 20-year-old capital of Kazakhstan, Lukin discounted the rivalry affecting the regional grouping, “There is a lot of rivalry at the grouping already. I hope that, on the contrary, it will provide a new and important platform for India-Pakistan dialogue.”
While Indian and Pakistani officials said there has been no request for a meeting from either side so far, nobody here is ruling out the possibility. Many remember the sudden meetings between them in the leaders’ lounge in Paris at the Climate Change summit in November 2015. That image of both sitting on a sofa, breaking away from protocol, is still fresh.
P Stobdan, who has been India’s envoy to Kyrgyzstan and a senior fellow at IDSA, said when Russian President Vladimir Putin and Sharif had an informal meeting in Beijing recently during the Belt and Road Initiative summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping had also joined at the end. “Putin and Xi supposedly had offered to play a mediatory role between Sharif and Modi at Astana,” Stobdan told The Indian Express.
While that may be easier said than done, since positions have hardened in the last year or so — from the Uri attack to Kulbhushan Jadhav, ties have plumbed new depths.
According to Stobdan, Sharif is said to have conveyed in advance that a meeting would be useful only “if India assures cessation of hostilities against the innocent people of Kashmir.” That kind of redline, many feel, could be a non-starter.
But whether Modi and Sharif meet or not, one of the most valuable takeaways from joining SCO is that India is ready to cooperate fully with the Regional Anti Terrorism Structure (RATS) of the SCO for exchanging information and working out a common strategy for combating terrorism, Indian officials said.
Meena Singh Roy said, “Ever since its creation in 2004, RATS has focused on collective counter-terrorist training and has coordinated with member-states specifically over the Winter Asian Games in Astana in 2010 and during the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The main objective is to establish a mechanism of communication between the SCO member-states in order to facilitate greater coordination between each state’s internal security organs. It organises regular meetings of border agencies to discuss effective means to tackle the existing challenges. It has prevented 600 terrorist attacks. Last year, 400 terrorists were arrested and more than 100 extradited. Over 900 anti-terrorist personnel have been trained till 2014.”
An observer country at the SCO since 2005, India applied for full membership in 2014. The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic and military organisation which was founded in 2001 in Shanghai by the leaders of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
On Thursday, a bilateral meeting between Modi and host Nazarbayev is planned, followed by dinner. Officials said that a bilateral meeting between Xi Jinping and Modi is also being worked out over the next two days, their first after the Belt and Road Initiative summit last month, which was boycotted by India."

In the aftermath of the Uri attack, Pakistan now seems to be flexing its muscles preempting a strike from India to destroy terrorist targets in Pakistan. During the last few days, Pakistani Air Force has increased air exercises. There are now regular instances of fighter aircraft landings on major highways, closing of civilian airspace, cancelling of civilian flights for F-16s flying sorties over its capital Islamabad and air force using civilian airports for their operations.
On Thursday night, Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir posted pictures of an F-16 fighter flying over Islamabad. Prior to that, Pakistani fighter aircraft were seen landing on highways. Although Pakistani officials said these are part of a regular exercise called ‘High Mark’, the timings suggests otherwise.
Watch what else is making news

According to reports, Pakistani fighter aircraft carried out multiple take-off and landing exercises on a six-lane motorway connecting Islamabad with Lahore, close to the India-Pakistan border and another highway connecting Islamabad with Peshawar. Reports also mentioned that flights from Islamabad to Gilgit, Chitral and Skardu were cancelled and the situation will remain like this for the next few days. Reports also suggested that local airports in the region are being used by the air force.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The move appears to be defensive posturing. Islamabad looks to reiterate its preparedness to stop any offensive from India on Pakistan territory. It is also important to its response strategy as the country has failed to gain any support against India on the diplomatic front during the ongoing 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly.
After the terrorist attack on Indian Army’s Uri camp that killed 18 Indian soldiers, India stepped up pressure on Pakistan to act against terrorists behind the attack and other outfits operating from within its territory. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government promised befitting action against the perpetrators of the attack. Considering the possible collateral damage in various retaliatory options, Pakistan may have calculated that India would prefer carrying out surgical strikes and air raids across the border to neutralise known terror camps and terrorists.
Nawaz Sharif raised the issue of Kashmir at the UNGA and tried to divert the issue of Uri attacks to Indian Army’s alleged excesses in the state. However, after considerable dialogue the international community is coming out and acknowledging Pakistan’s role as an international terror sponsor. In the past, after every attack on Indian territory, India’s primary response used to be generally non-military and ending of dialogues. This new aggressive stance posed by PM Modi seems to have rattled India’s western neighbour and now it seems that it is trying to show its readiness and resolve to counter India on the military front in case India launches any sort of military or covert strike."

Express Photo by Prem Nath Pandey
A RESOLUTION proposed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at the special session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly Friday, backing the ‘surgical’ strikes on terror launchpads across the Line Of Control, turned into a back and forth between the AAP and BJP-led opposition.
While Kejriwal carefully worded the resolution “backing the surgical strikes” as a “befitting reply” to “enemy forces” following the Uri attacks, Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta settled for nothing but “praise” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts.
What started out as the AAP’s efforts to set aside political differences and “stand united in the face of enemy forces”, was swept aside by Gupta. Responding to the resolution, Gupta said, “Even the Army Chief has praised the political leadership… One line should be added to the resolution praising the Prime Minister. While we are discussing all this, I also want to say that just three hours before the surgical strikes, the CM had tweeted ‘Excellent article. On Uri, rather than Pak, India seems to be getting isolated internationally’… this is not good for the morale of the people. I urge him to delete his tweet.”
Watch What Else Is Making News:https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Relieving the tension, Water and Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra responded, “When the Indian cricket team wins, of course credit should also be given to the BCCI chief.” Mishra continued, “Baar baar hamara sar neecha hota tha… when Pathankot attacks took place, the ISI was invited to join the investigation. Isse bada kala din hamare desh mein kabhi nahin aaya hoga. Bharat Mata isse zyada sharminda kabhi nahin huyi hogi, phoot phoot ke royi hogi (That was a Black Day for us. Mother India must have been humiliated and cried)… Uri attack ke baad paani sar se upar nikal gaya tha aur agar ab bhi kuchh nahi hota toh Kashmir se Kanyakumari tak pratishodh hota. (After the Uri attacks it became too much to endure, if nothing was done people from Kashmir to Kanyakumari would have gotten up to take revenge).”
Labour Minister Gopal Rai also said, “Isse poore desh ko tasalli mili hai. India should not come under pressure from the United States or China to take on Pakistan…” As Speaker Ram Niwas Goel proceeded to put the resolution to vote, Gupta stood up to clarify the amendment.
“So are you amending the resolution and adding that one line or not? Just say yes or no. We should know,” he said. Kejriwal nudged him, following which he said: “We would like to thank the Prime Minister, the Defence Minister and all the chiefs of the Armed Forces also. Let us add this to the resolution.”
On the ‘surgical strikes’, Kejriwal warned Pakistan to “desist from repeating such incidents”. “I urge upon the government to proactively take all necessary measures to ensure that our military installations are fully secured, so that tragic incidents such as Uri and Pathankot do not happen again…,” he said.
Even as the assembly moved on to discuss the “failures of the MCD” in curbing vector-borne diseases, Kejriwal brought up the issue of the Centre-state tussle. “There have been false cases against 16 of our MLAs, one even on me, which was later called a typing error… Now that there are issues at the LoC, we will sort out our differences later…,” he said."

The list of security personnel martyred in a terror strike at an Army base in Nagrota, near Jammu was released by the Army late Tuesday evening. Among the seven dead, two of them were officers. Three terrorists were also killed in Nagrota, the biggest terror strike since the September 18 Uri attack.
Under the cover of darkness, according to one eyewitness account, terrorists, dressed in J&K Police fatigue, stormed the XVI Corps headquarters around 5 am. They scaled the wall surrounding the 166 Medium Regiment premises and hurled grenades before firing indiscriminately at the sentry post. The terrorists entered the residential quarters meant for majors, but a hostage situation was averted by troops.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the public on Saturday in Kozhikode for the first time ever since the Uri attacks. He started his address in Malayalam and said, “When we think of Kerala, we think of God’s Own Country, it has an impression of purity and holiness.” He addressed the nation at the backdrop of a three-day BJP conclave which is ongoing in Kozhikode. PM is on a two-day visit, where he will participate in the National Council meet.
In a terse message to Pakistan, PM Modi slammed the country for exporting terrorism across the world and said, “While India exports software, Pakistan exports terrorism across the world.”

India Thursday said it will welcome Pakistan’s participation at the Heart of Asia (HoA) conference to be held in Amritsar on December 4 although it has not received any official confirmation from it so far.
“We are yet to receive an official confirmation from Pakistan and also the level of participation,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said, when asked whether there will be a Indo-Pak bilateral meeting as Pakistan’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has already announced his country will attend the conference.
He also said HoA was a ministerial-level meeting and a multilateral conference to discuss peace, development and economic cooperation for the prosperity of Afghanistan. “We will certainly welcome all countries to Amritsar because we are totally committed to peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. HoA process is a very important process for taking that particular narrative forward….and how international community can partner…https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We will welcome the participation of Pakistan,” he said, while noting that, India was expecting more than 40 countries and organisations to attend the meet.
Last year in December, the meeting of the HoA process was hosted by Pakistan and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had attended it after which she had a bilateral talks with Aziz. The two sides had also announced resumption of Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue (CBD), which never took-off due to terror strikes, including Pathankot attack by Pakistan-based elements.
India had recently boycotted the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit which was scheduled to be held in Islamabad. Citing continuous cross-border terrorism from Pakistan following the Uri attack, India had said, “in the present circumstances” it was unable to take part in the SAARC summit."

Two days after he promised tough action against any attempt to stall the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, a Karan Johar film starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis buckled under pressure. Fadnavis mediated talks Saturday between MNS president Raj Thackeray and Johar after the producers gave in to the MNS demand not to cast Pakistan artistes in future and to pay Rs 5 crore as ‘prayashchit’ (penance) to the Army welfare fund.

The MNS had earlier threatened to stall the movie’s Diwali release. The Chief Minister’s intervention — the meeting was held at his official residence Varsha — triggered a political storm in Maharashtra. The Opposition and ally Shiv Sena slammed the BJP, especially for letting Raj Thackeray walk out of the controversy claiming a victory.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the meeting at Varsha — it was held a day after Union Home Minister Rajnath’s Singh’s visit to Mumbai to attend the western council meeting of chief ministers and other officials of Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat — Fadnavis said the Film and TV Producers Guild of India was justified in taking the decision to ban Pakistani actors in Indian cinema in wake of the border developments and overall public sentiment.
“I told them I appreciate your desh bhakti and informed them about various welfare schemes undertaken by the Indian Army where they can help. They can take up the welfare cause ahead by talking to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar,” Fadnavis said.
“The film producers told me that the decision to cast the Pakistani actor was taken long ago and was part of the initiative of the previous government to promote cultural exchange and man-to-man contact. However, after the attack against India, coupled with the Pakistan ban on airing of Indian content on television and radio, there cannot be any justification to support Pakistani actors,” he said.

Stressing the fact that the dispute over Ae Dil Hain Mushkil has been resolved, he said, “Maharashtra’s law and order is my responsibility and utmost concern. I have to deal with an iron hand and also send a strong message that it can never be compromised at any cost.”
He rejected Opposition criticism that the government had shown its weakness by intervening in the matter. “If that were the case, we would not have cracked the whip against MNS activists who vandalised theatres. Nor would we go ahead with the release of the film on its scheduled date in theatres. From the very beginning, I have maintained that security will be provided to all theatres which are screening the film.”

Later, speaking in Manthan, a programme organised by Aaj Tak, Fadnavis said: “I do not think that what Raj Thackeray was demanding and what the producers guild voluntarily offered was something different. The producers guild had already said that they had wholehearted support for our Army men and wanted to do something for them.”
Asked why he gave so much importance to call and meet an outfit which forced producers to pay “hafta”, he said, “These two stakeholders needed a mediation and that’s what I did and came out with an amicable solution.”
Earlier, at the CM residence, Johar arrived for the meeting accompanied by Film and TV Producers Guild of India chief Mukesh Bhatt, filmmaker Sajid Nadiadwala, UTV motion pictures CEO Siddharth Roy Kapur, and Fox Star Studios CEO Vijay Singh. Raj Thackeray was accompanied by his party’s film wing chief Ameya Khopkar and MNS general secretary Shalini Thackeray.

While Raj Thackeray agreed to withdraw the protest against the movie’s release during the meeting, the BJP appeared to have given him a respectable exit.
Soon after the meeting, the MNS chief claimed victory. “It was the Chief Minister who had approached me for a compromise,” Thackeray said. He went on to suggest that his party had withdrawn the protest only after Johar and the Producers Guild had agreed to all the riders that he had put forth.
According to the compromise formula, Johar has agreed to contribute Rs 5 crore to the Army welfare fund. The MNS has claimed that the rider also extends to two other films — Shahrukh Khan starrer Raees featuring Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, and Alia Bhatt starrer Dear Zindagi featuring Ali Zafar, both of which are in post production stages.
Mukesh Bhatt said, “I have assured the CM that the producers guild won’t work with Pakistani artistes in future films. A resolution to this effect will be passed soon.”
Johar, meanwhile, has agreed to display a slide paying tribute to the martyrs of the Uri attack at the start of his film.
Thackeray called the donation to the Army welfare fund a ‘prayashchit’ (penance) by the filmmakers.
Incidentally, the compromise was struck at a time when some MNS men were arrested for threatening cinema hall owners against screening the film. While the MNS claimed victory, it needed an exit route out of the controversy, especially after its workers were detained. The Chief Minister appeared to have shown the MNS chief a way out.
Following the meeting, Shalini Thackeray said: “We will also allow the screening of Raees and Dear Zindagi provided the producers guild passes the resolution on banning Pakistani artistes and submits it to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry.”
With Fadnavis under fire for his flip-flop, Maharashtra BJP chief Raosaheb Danve Patil came out in his support. “As the CM, one has to ensure there is law and order across the state, above everything else. This can’t be seen as caving in to the MNS demand or pandering to it. The CM deserves credit for resolving the matter,” he said.
The makers and team of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil have decided to contribute a portion of the film’s revenue to the Army welfare fund. The movie will now release on October 28 as scheduled."

The entire issue surfaced in the aftermath of the recent Uri attack which snowballed into a major conflict between the two nations. “We gave a 48-hour deadline to Pakistani actors and artists to leave India or MNS will push them out,” said Amey Khopkar, MNS Chitrapat Sena.

Khopkar threatened to beat up Pakistani artists, including even the filmmakers who cast them in their productions. “Pakistani kalakaar toh maar khaayenge hi, saath mein jo yahan producer/director hain unko bhi peetenge (Pakistani artists will be beaten up and so will the producers and directors),” he said.

As soon as the news calling for a ban on Pakistani artists reached the internet, Twitter trends like #SayNoToPakArtists, #BoycottPakOrNot and #KickOutPakis started doing the rounds. While there are some people who find it absolutely unnecessary to ban the artists because that’s not going to solve the problem of terrorism, there are some who fully support it and believe it’ll be a lesson to the country.
Zindagi is an Indian Hindi-Urdu entertainment television channel and runs syndicated content from countries such as Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey.

(Source: File Photo)
With India-Pakistan ties facing continued turbulence after the deadly terror strike in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 17 Indian soldiers were killed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s presence in the SAARC summit in Islamabad this November remains doubtful. According to sources, no decision has been taken as yet on the Prime Minister’s participation at the SAARC summit meet in Islamabad.
Following the terror strike on the Army base in Uri, India lashed out at Pakistan holding it responsible for the attack. Branding Pakistan a ‘terrorist state’ and stating that it should be identified and isolated as such, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said there are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped.
“I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,” he said in a series of tweets. Meanwhile, condemning the terror attack as well, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the nation that those behind the ‘despicable’ attack will not go unpunished.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,” the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets. Hinting at the Jaish-e-Mohammad’s role behind the Uri attack, India’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh also asserted that the evil designs would get a befitting reply.
However, Pakistan has flatly refused New Delhi’s claims of Islamabad’s involvement in Uri terror attack, stating that said that pointing fingers on them has become a traditional tendency of India after each terrorist attack. “Pointing fingers at Pakistan has become a traditional tendency of India after each terrorist attack,” the Dawn quoted Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria as saying.
“In the past many Indians were involved in the terrorist acts for which India had blamed Pakistan,” he asserted. At least 17 soldiers lost their lives and 19 others injured post the terror strike on an army camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla district. All four terrorists have been killed in what has emerged as worse than the attack on the Pathankot air base earlier in January this year, in which seven army men were killed."

A day after the Uri terror attack claimed the lives of 18 Army personnel, New Delhi has decided to up the ante against Pakistan on the global stage — much like it did after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.
The government has decided to field External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is likely to raise the terror attacks in Uri and Pathankot in her speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Sources said she is likely to deliver her address — on behalf of the government of India — on September 26.
The speech will not be the only diplomatic move to corner Pakistan. Sources said the Indian mission to the UN will also set up bilateral meetings with a host of foreign ministers and other leaders representing various countries at the UN — in a bid to highlight Pakistan’s role in terrorist activities in Kashmir and other parts of India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said India’s Permanent Representative at the UN Syed Akbaruddin will take this up with his counterparts at the UN in New York, where world leaders will descend for the annual UNGA session.
“This global outreach will be in a proactive manner, much like India’s outreach post 26/11,” a South Block source said.
Within hours of the Uri attack, Indian envoys in capitals across the world were asked to get foreign governments to condemn the attack.
This prompted the Indian envoy in the UK, Navtej Sarna, to set up the first phone conversation between UK’s foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Swaraj, in which he said that UK “condemns all forms of terrorism and stands shoulder to shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism, and in bringing the perpetrators to justice”.
On Monday, several foreign governments and leaders issued public statements condemning the attack.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon asserted that the perpetrators of the attack would be brought to justice and all stakeholders would meet their responsibilities to maintain peace and stability.
Sources said the Indian envoy in France, Mohan Kumar, also dialled the French Foreign Ministry, following which Paris issued a statement: “France most firmly condemns the terrible terrorist attack perpetrated against an Indian Army camp in the region of Kashmir.”
“France remains at India’s side in the combat against terrorism. It calls on every State to fight effectively against terrorist groups operating on their territory or from their territory against other countries,” it said.

France also recalled the importance it attaches to bringing a peaceful settlement of disputes in Kashmir region, a French Foreign Ministry statement said.
The country also called for decisive action to be taken, in accordance with international law, against terrorist groups targeting India, particularly the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.
During a press briefing in Paris on Monday, the Deputy Spokesperson for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development said, “After Pathankot earlier this year, this attack reminds us that India, like France, is a victim of terrorism… As underscored by the President of the French Republic during his India visit in January this year, all countries must effectively combat terrorism emanating from their territory or from territories under their control.”
As Joint Secretary (Americas) Munu Mahawar, who was a Joint Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office till a few months ago, liaised with the American and Canadian governments, acting High Commissioner for Canada to India Jess Dutton condemned the Uri attack.
“We are appalled by these attacks and stand with the Government of India in the fight against terrorism,” Dutton said.
While US ambassador Richard Verma and State Department official John Kirby had condemned the attack on Sunday, Verma on Monday came out in solidarity with the Indian Army and tweeted about the Indo-US joint exercise. Russia and China also came out with statements by Monday evening — which meant that all P-5 countries had condemned the terrorist attack, although their language differed.
In New Delhi, Afghanistan’s Ambassador to India Shaida Abdali said that countries that use terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy should not only be isolated but also held accountable for taking innocent lives.
Stressing that his country, which has been a victim of terrorism for a long time, can “share the pain”, he said it was high time that the international community chalks a new course of action to “effectively and actively” deal with countries which use terrorism as state policy.
In Geneva, India once again raised the issue of Pakistan’s “illegal and forcible” occupation of Indian territory in J&K and added that the “fundamental reason for disturbances in Kashmir is cross-border terrorism promoted by Pakistan”. This was in response to Pakistan’s statements on the Kashmir turmoil.
India’s political counsellor at its mission to the UN in Geneva, Alok Ranjan Jha, who made the statement on behalf of the Indian government, also highlighted the “human rights violations in entire Pakistan”. “The human rights violations cry for the world’s attention: the people of Balochistan, amongst other provinces, have been waging for decades a bitter and brave struggle against their daily abuse and torture,” the Indian statement at the UN Human Rights Council said.
“Various international organisations have documented how enforced disappearances continue with impunity, particularly in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, where members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement are routinely abducted and unlawfully killed. Selective but extremely opaque and high-handed use of force by Pakistani authorities has affected civilian populations on a large scale. More than one million people remain displaced as a result of the current and past armed conflicts in the northwest of Pakistan,” Jha said.
Given this state of affairs, he said that Pakistan will be well-advised to focus its energies on setting its own house in order and acting against the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on its neighbours instead of ritually raking up alleged human rights violations elsewhere.
“We, once again, ask Pakistan to stop inciting and supporting violence and terrorism in any part of India and refrain from meddling in our internal affairs in any manner. We call upon the Council to urge Pakistan to fulfil its obligation to vacate illegal occupation of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,” he said."

The actor shared,” India’s response to every terrorist attack-Kadee Ninda, Condolences, High Level Meeting. Kab tak aisa chalega sir @narendramodi ? #UriAttack.” On the other hand Riteish Deshmukh wrote,”Deepest condolences to the families of #UriAttack martyrs who laid down their lives fighting for their motherland.”
Director Madhur Bhandarkar wrote, “Saddened to know about the cowardly militant attack at Uri. My salute to the bravehearts martyred and condolences to the families #UriAttack.”
In one of the worst casualties suffered by the Indian Army in recent times, a fidayeen attack left at least 17 soldiers dead at the rear base of an infantry regiment in Uri. The early morning attack was carried out by four terrorists, all of whom have been neutralised.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a high-level meeting attended by top ministers and other officials over the deadly terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Army Chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag besides other senior officials attended the meeting.

The Defence Minister and the Army Chief had visited Kashmir after the terror attack on Sunday.
Heavily armed militants from Pakistan-based JeM had on Sunday stormed an army base in Uri in Kashmir, killing 17 jawans.
India had reacted strongly to the deadliest attack on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir that sparked an outrage with the Prime Minister strongly condemning it.

“We strongly condemn the cowardly terror attack in Uri. I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished,” Modi had said.
The Home Minister, who had on Sunday called an emergency meeting in Delhi, had pointed a finger directly at Pakistan, saying it is a “terrorist state” and should be isolated while BJP leader Ram Madhav said days of strategic restraint are over and suggested that “for one tooth, the complete jaw” should be the policy after the attack."

Shah Rukh Khan starer Raees is scheduled to hit the screens on January 25 and a few days prior to the launch, and old video of Pakistani actor Mahira Khan who’s playing the role of Shah Rukh’s love interest in the film has surfaced on the Internet. The video is being massively shared on social media because Mahira can be heard talking ill of India.
Participating in a chat show and sitting opposite comedian Omar Sharif, Mahira said, ““Aapko India se inspire nahi hona chahiye. Bilkul nahi. Hum Bollywood nahi hain (We should never be inspired from Indians. We are not Bollywood).” The two can be seen talking about how they should make Pakistan strong and talk about ‘Pakistaniyat’. Sharif, in the video, also makes a light comment on how Bollywood is a ticket to Hollywood.
The clip, which was captured over five years ago, hasn’t gone down well with many on the Internet especially before the release.

Pakistan on Sunday refuted as “unfounded and premature” India’s charge that it was behind the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri that killed 17 soldiers, with its army demanding “actionable intelligence” to support New Delhi’s accusation.
Following the dawn attack, India blamed Pakistan for the latest attack on the Indian Army. Home Minister Rajnath Singh directly attacked Pakistan saying it was a “terrorist state” and should be isolated.
Pakistan army spokesman Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa said that following the attack Director General of Military Operation (DGMO) of the two countries discussed the situation along the Line of Control through hotline.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Refuting the unfounded and pre-mature Indian allegation, Pakistani DGMO asked his counterpart to share any actionable intelligence,” Radio Pakistan reported citing an ISPR release.
Bajwa reiterated that no infiltration was allowed from the Pakistani soil because of “water-tight arrangements” in place on both sides of LoC and the Working Boundary.
Heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the strike in which four ultras were neutralised."

It has been 10 years since the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack happened, the dark memories of shooting and killing of innocent people by terrorists still flicker alive. The Hindi film fraternity on Monday paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.
Producer Ronnie Screwvala and makers of upcoming film Uri, based on the Uri attack of September 2016, showed their respect to all those martyred on that day by observing silence across 300 radio stations all over India on Monday morning.
On the tenth anniversary of the attack, Bollywood celebrities like Abhishek Bachchan and Varun Dhawan paid tribute to the victims and martyrs and said it’s a day that can’t be forgotten.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

A day after new Army chief Mukund Naravane warned Pakistan that New Delhi reserves the right to “preemptively strike” at the source of terror, Pakistan Wednesday rejected his statement, terming it “irresponsible”.
Reacting to Gen Naravane’s remarks, the Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement said, “We reject the new Indian Army Chief’s irresponsible statement regarding ‘pre-emptive strikes’ across the LoC” inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”
“There should be no doubt about Pakistan’s resolve and readiness to thwart against any aggressive Indian move”, inside its territory or PoK, it said. “No one should forget Pakistan’s befitting response to India’s Balakot misadventure,” it added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours escalated following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in Kashmir last year. About 44 CRPF personnel were killed when an explosive-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses carrying the forces from Jammu to Srinagar. Following the template of the surgical strikes after the Uri attack in 2016, the IAF conducted an airstrike at JeM training camps in Balakot before dawn on February 26.
In an interview to news agency PTI barely hours after taking charge of the 1.3-million strong force, Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane had on Tuesday said India reserves the right to “preemptively strike” at sources of terror. He asserted that a “new normal” in the country’s response mechanism to acts of cross-border terrorism has already been “emphatically” displayed.
“If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to preemptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation,” the Army Chief said in New Delhi, in a stern warning to Islamabad.
Reacting to Gen Naravane’s remarks, the Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement said, “We reject the new Indian Army Chief’s irresponsible statement regarding ‘pre-emptive strikes’ across the LoC” inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
Naravane replaces General Bipin Rawat as the new Chief of Army staff. Rawat, who retired from his former position Tuesday, has been appointed India’s first Chief of Defence Staff."

India has never said no to a dialogue with Pakistan but it will be about stopping terrorism rather than on Jammu and Kashmir, a top official in the government told The Indian Express today amid reports from Islamabad that “contact has been established” between the National Security Advisors of both India and Pakistan.
According to a Press Trust of India report, India’s NSA Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Nasir Janjua spoke over the phone — the first such chat after the Uri attack and the surgical strikes — and discussed ways to reduce tension, said Sartaj Aziz, Advisor on Foreign Affairs to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

When asked about the phone call, the top official neither confirmed nor denied these reports.
The political and security establishment here are waiting to see how Pakistan responds to the strikes which, according to New Delhi, inflicted heavy casualties on Pakistan. Islamabad denies the strikes, saying it was a case of cross-border firing.
Sources said that going public with the strikes has given New Delhi new — and more — room to manoeuvre in its interaction with Islamabad. It has also somewhat levelled the playing field, the official said, because Pakistan has been told that “every Uri will see some kind of a reaction along the border”.

That’s why India is unlikely to scale down, any time soon, its “talk-only-terror” stand.
When asked if India would respond positively to Pakistan if it offers to have peace talks, the top official responded by pointing to a TV screen which was showing last night’s attack in Baramulla saying: “Is this their offer of peace talks?”"

Two days after he reached out to the people of Pakistan and urged them to wage a war against poverty, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told top officials, who had gathered Monday to review implementation of the 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, that “rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta” (blood and water cannot flow together).
Moving to mount pressure on Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack, the government decided that the meeting of the Indus water commissioners of the two countries can “only take place in an atmosphere free from terror”. This means that the meetings of the commissioners, held twice a year, stand suspended with immediate effect. Since 1960, the water commissioners have met 112 times.

New Delhi also decided to maximise the potential of India’s use of water on the three western rivers — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — in the areas of hydro-power, irrigation and storage, and agreed to review the “unilateral suspension” of the Tulbul navigation project on the Jhelum in Kashmir. The project was suspended in 2007 as a goodwill gesture after Pakistan’s objection.
The government decided to “move expeditiously” on the three power projects on the Chenab river — Pakaldul which is under construction, and Sawalkot and Bursar which are in advanced stages of planning.
“The message which we want to convey is that don’t take India for granted,” sources said. Asked whether abrogation of the treaty was discussed at the meeting, sources said, “We can tell you what has been agreed upon.”
Meanwhile, India’s Indus water commissioner and officials from the Ministry of External Affairs left Monday for Washington to attend a meeting with the World Bank that brokered the Indus treaty.
Officials said the visit related to discussions on the Kishanganga hydel project in Kashmir over which Pakistan had dragged India to the International Court of Arbitration. That case was decided in India’s favour, but Pakistan has again sought the help of the World Bank. Pakistani officials are also travelling to Washington.
Sources said though the visit was planned much before the Uri attack, it would not be surprising that the latest developments come up for discussions at the meetings in Washington. “This was not the agenda, but how can you now avoid it,” an official said.

Kishanganga is one of the three major disputes between the two countries on the treaty, the other two being the Baglihar dam on Chenab and the Tulbul project on Wullar lake, both in Jammu and Kashmir. Baglihar also required World Bank mediation and was settled in India’s favour.
Monday’s meeting by the Prime Minister comes in the wake of demands for the government to walk out of the Indus Waters Treaty.
The treaty gave India full rights over the waters of the eastern rivers, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. In return, India had to let the western rivers — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — flow “unrestricted” to Pakistan. India could use the waters of western rivers as well, but only in a “non-consumptive” manner. It could use it for domestic purposes, and even for irrigation and hydropower production, but only in the manner specified in the treaty.
After the meeting that lasted an hour and half, it was agreed that the Indian side needed to exploit the full potential of the western rivers according to provisions of the treaty. “India must use its rights to the fullest,” sources said. To underline the seriousness, the government also decided to set up an inter-ministerial task force which will comprise all relevant stakeholders. “It will be taken up with a sense of urgency,” sources said.
Reasoning that the beneficiaries of maximum use of the rivers will benefit the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially farmers of the state, sources cited a debate in the J&K assembly more than a decade ago when almost all political parties had called the treaty as unfair to the state. According to sources, estimated losses from the “unfair water-sharing” amount to Rs 6,000-6,500 crore annually.
Detailing the low use of water from the three western rivers by India, sources said that under the treaty, India can use waters that can irrigate land up to 13 lakh acres. But it has been only using water that can irrigate up to 8 lakh acres. So, sources said, this use can be scaled up to irrigate another 5 lakh acres.
For hydro-power, sources said that the three rivers have the potential of generating power upto 18,600 MW. However, it is currently producing only 3,034 MW. And, power projects of 2,526 MW are under construction, while another 5,846 MW projects are under advanced stages of approval.
“So, if you add all, we are either using or planning to use water that generate power up to 11,406 MW. That allows us to scale up till 18,600 MW — another 7,000 MW power can be generated,” sources said.
And for storage, sources said, India can store upto 3.6 million acre feet of water from these three rivers. But India has no storage capacity so far. “This storage capacity can also be built,” sources said.
Water is a hot-button issue for Pakistan and Islamabad has always raised the issue of “unfair water-sharing” from India in its dialogue. While India claims that it has always honoured its commitments under the 1960 treaty, Islamabad claims the opposite. The theme of water was put as part of the dialogue process at the insistence of Pakistan.
However, in this case, New Delhi said that they have only decided to follow the treaty and increase usage as part of its share. Sources said"

INDIA AND Singapore Tuesday agreed to step up cooperation in countering threats of rising terrorism, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi terming cross-border terrorism and increasing radicalisation as “grave challenges” endangering the very fabric of the two societies.
Modi, who held comprehensive talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on ways to enhance cooperation in key sectors, including trade and investment, said defence and security cooperation is a key pillar of strategic partnership between India and Singapore.
Addressing a joint press meet, Lee condemned terrorism and offered condolences to the families of the soldiers killed in the Uri attack. Emphasising that the “rising tide of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalisation are grave challenges to our security”, Modi said, “They threaten the very fabric of our societies.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Watch what else is making news:


He added, “It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace and humanity need to act together against this menace. Today, we have agreed to enhance our cooperation to counter these threats, including in the domain of cyber security.”
Modi also noted that as two maritime nations, keeping the sea lanes of communication open and respect for international legal order of seas and oceans was a shared priority. The two countries also inked three pacts, including the one dealing with intellectual property rights, to facilitate greater business-to-business exchanges and collaborations. Describing trade and investment as the bedrock of bilateral relationship, Modi said India has embarked on a path of strong economic growth and transformation, and it regards Singapore as a key partner in this journey.
Agreeing to expedite the second review of Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, the two leaders also welcomed the issuance of corporate rupee bonds in Singapore which was a step forward in mobilising capital for India’s large infrastructure development needs.
“I have been informed that Singapore is leading the world in putting driverless cars on the road. But, I rest assured, we all rest assured, that one of India’s strongest well-wishers, Prime Minister Lee, is in the driving
seat for Singapore and for our bilateral relationship. Excellency Lee, you are a friend of India,” Modi said.
Lee said they also discussed furthering Singapore and India’s strong economic ties, for instance, by setting up a finance dialogue between the finance ministries of both the countries. On the Singapore side, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will be appointed for the task and India will appoint Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to find “win-win outcomes” for both countries, he added.
The Singapore PM also said, “Singapore remains a firm believer in India and we will continue to contribute, where we can, to India’s remarkable development story.”
Referring to the inking of two MoUs, Modi said a skill development centre for the Northeastern states in Guwahati would be set up under it. He also welcomed the inauguration of the Centre of Excellence for Tourism Training in Udaipur in cooperation with the Rajasthan government."

Days before its release on Friday, another roadblock before Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (ADHM) seemed to have cleared with the Pakistan Film Exhibitors Association (PFEA) hinting at a climbdown from its earlier position of banning the release of Indian films in Pakistan.
At a meeting of its members this afternoon, the PFEA discussed the matter in the wake of Indian Army’s statement slamming the MNS’s demand for a donation of Rs 5 crore to the Army fund as a tribute to the soldiers who died in the Uri attack.

“India is allowing the release of ADHM and that too without editing Fawad Khan’s role. And the statement by the Indian Army also assures us that the attempt is to resolve issues, not escalate them,” said Zoraiz Lashari, head of PFEA. The decision, he admitted, is also an economic one. “No one stands to gain by banning films. It will hurt the film industries on either side of the border,” Lashari added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, he said the decision to lift the self-imposed ban was not final.
“We will have one more meeting tomorrow, because the Indian film industry’s ban on working with Pakistani artistes still stands, but things look positive as of now,” he said.
If PFEA decides in favour of releasing Indian films in Pakistan, ADHM and Shivaay will hit Pakistani screen this Friday, alongside India.
As a reaction to the PFEA’s softening of stand, the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI), too, is considering releasing ADHM in its theatres. Nitin Datar, president of COEAI, told The Indian Express that the matter seems to have been largely resolved, which is prompting the members to consider releasing the film in their theatres."

Mahesh Bhatt has often been slammed for unearthing talent from Pakistan and giving it a platform in Indian filmdom. But the filmmaker, who has worked with artistes like Atif Aslam, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Sara Loren from across the border, believes there is no glory in war. He says problems, including between India and Pakistan, should be solved through peaceful means without firing a bullet.
Be it a warning by a regional political party in the wake of the Uri attack in India last year or criticism from members of the film fraternity, Bhatt has been targeted for working with artistes from Pakistan despite India’s strained bilateral ties with the nation.
Talking about such attacks on him, Bhatt told IANS in an interview: “We are on the brink of doom. We need to pause and realise that there is no glory in war. There is glory in peace.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Those who see glory in war must go to the soldiers whom they pretend to worship… or even to their families, and ask them what they think of war. After awards are given to them and they get five minutes of focus in the media, they have a life ahead of it.”
He stressed on the fact that human history, which is “soaked with blood”, has painfully realised that there is no glory in war.
“We should solve problems through dialogues and peaceful means, without a bullet being fired. This is my position on the issue of India-Pakistan or for other neighbouring countries.”
He knows that when the winds of hatred blow, the talk of peace will be laughed at. Irrespective of that, he is willing to extend the hand of friendship.

 
Doesn’t he fear for his life?
“Everything has a price tag. If you take a position, you have to be able to face the consequences. When winds of so-called ‘peace’ blow, then everybody talks about the joy of co-existence, etc. But it is in the darkest night that you need to light a candle,” said the “Saaransh” helmer.

As of now, he is extremely proud of his latest production “Begum Jaan”, set against the backdrop of India’s Partition in 1947. Though the Indian audience can catch the film, which hit the screens on Friday, the same can’t be said about moviebuffs in Pakistan.
“I wish they (Pakistan’s censor board) had given my film a viewing and then taken this decision of not granting the permission to be screened in Pakistan,” said Bhatt, who described the film as a “milestone” in his Vishesh Films banner’s journey.
Since it’s such an important film to him, didn’t he wish to direct it himself?
 

 
“Srijit Mukherji (director of Begum Jaan) has an original voice. I would have been jealous had I been competing for this job,” said Bhatt, who last directed the film “Kartoos” in 1999.
Begum Jaan is the Hindi adaptation of Mukherji’s hard-hitting 2015 Bengali movie Rajkahini. While the director was retained for the Hindi project, why was actress Rituparna Sengupta replaced by Padma Shri awardee Vidya Balan?
“The film (Hindi version) is completely different. The story moved away from the east to the west. We changed the milieu and the cultural space. It has a north Indian narrative. It has moved far beyond Rajkahini’,” he clarified."

The Uri terror attacks on September 18 saw 19 soldiers of the Indian Army being martyred. Since then, the country has been simmering with anger and disappointment. Though India responded through “surgical strikes” on terrorist launch-pads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), the bloodshed of innocent soldiers have continued.
Meanwhile, many including soldiers have taken to social media and are using the space to express their anger and hurt at the state of unrest that has resulted in people losing lives.

He then begins to recite his poem, through which he tells everyone that he is ready to do anything for the country, for the people of the country who can sleep peacefully back in their homes, knowing that there are BSF soldiers to guard the borders.

Marking a radical departure from the past in its response to cross-border terrorism, India Thursday announced that its Army had carried out “surgical strikes” in the early hours of the day to destroy seven launch pads along the Line of Control where teams of terrorists had positioned themselves.
This is the first time New Delhi has officially acknowledged a military strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) — cross-LoC operations in the past have never elicited any official response.

The public announcement by the Indian Army also signalled rapid deterioration in New Delhi’s ties with Islamabad in the wake of the September 18 Uri attack which left 18 soldiers dead, and which saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi promise that it would not go unpunished.
The Army said “significant casualties” were inflicted among the “terrorists and those providing support to them” but gave no count of the dead.
In a statement, the Pakistan Army said two of its soldiers had been killed in firing “on the LoC in Bhimber, Hotspring, Kel and Lipa sectors. Exchange of fire which started at 0230 hrs after midnight continued till 0800 hrs”.
Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), told reporters in New Delhi: “The operations were focused on ensuring that these terrorists do not succeed in their design to cause destruction and endanger the lives of our citizens.” The operations, he said, have since ceased and the Indian Army does not have plans for further continuation.

The announcement was made after an urgent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by the Prime Minister, Thursday morning.
Sources said the military operation was led by the Special Forces which had been kept ready for the past one week for such an action, with extensive rehearsals of various contingency plans.
The operation, which commenced past midnight, was successfully completed by 4.30 am. But the Special Forces soldiers had been positioned into the forward bases along the LoC by helicopters around 2 pm Wednesday.
The final go-ahead for the operation, sources said, was given at a meeting Wednesday evening at the PMO between the Prime Minister and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. The three service chiefs had briefed Parrikar before his meeting with the Prime Minister.

To confuse and distract the Pakistan Army, sources said the Indian Army started shelling at various points across the LoC around 9 pm Wednesday before the Special Forces soldiers moved on foot at two points in Kupwara and Poonch sectors to target the launch pads.
The Pakistani forces, sources said, were taken by surprise, and responded closer to dawn by shelling on Indian posts on the LoC. The operation was officially called off at 8 am, sources said.
The launch pads targeted in the operation had been kept under extensive surveillance for the past one week, sources said. The operation was launched, DGMO said, on “receiving specific and credible inputs that some terrorists had positioned themselves” at these launch pads.
“During these counter-terrorist operations, significant casualties were caused to terrorists and those providing support to them”, Lt General Singh said. He did not provide an exact count of the terrorists killed in the action.
The DGMO said he had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart and informed him of the military operation. “We cannot allow the terrorists to operate across the LoC with impunity and attack citizens of our country at will,” he said.
Army sources said forces on the LoC continue to remain at the highest alert. Commanders at all levels on the LoC had been empowered to retaliate strongly to any Pakistani shelling or firing in the coming days.
Before the ceasefire on the LoC came into force in November 2003, limited cross-LoC operations by the Army’s Border Action Teams (BAT) were a regular occurrence. Targeting launch pads over an arc of 250 km on the LoC, Thursday’s operation is much bigger in scope and extent than the earlier BAT operations.
Following the Uri attack, the government launched a diplomatic offensive to isolate Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi urged Pakistan to wage a war against poverty and the government, as part of a calibrated response, mounted pressure on Islamabad with a series of steps including a meeting to review the Indus Waters Treaty. Last Tuesday, India announced it would boycott the SAARC summit in Islamabad in November."

Sepoy Javra Munda, 35
Merla village, Khunti (Jharkhand)
For three generations, Merla village in Jharkhand’s Khunti district, 40 km from Ranchi, has seen a number of its residents joining the Army as young men, with the oldest having gone on to retire. On Monday, Merla awaited the arrival of its first martyr.
Sepoy Javra Munda, 35, was one of the 18 killed in the Uri attack. He had been posted in Kashmir for three years and been expecting a transfer.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“As far as I know, the entire unit was to be transferred to West Bengal and they were supposed to go to Uri for one last time,” said Francis Pardia, a 1971 war who retired in 1984, and whose father had been an Indian member of the British Army.
Yakriyash Topno, another veteran, said, “There were three or four of us who retired after serving in the Army. There are another three in the Army. Our heart bleeds today because Javra is the first martyr.”
Villagers are preparing to set up a memorial to their hero at the spot he is buried. “He will be buried in his own land and we will build a memorial there,” said Kashi Nath Mahato, overseeing the preparations.
Jhavra’s brother Daud Munda, 18 and a BA student, wants to join the Army. “There will be a recruitment rally in October in Ranchi. If I get through, I will join the Army. I have to take care of my Javra’s wife and three daughters. Also, I want to avenge my brother’s death,” he said.
Salmi Dhanwar, Javra’s mother, told villagers, “It is sad I have lost my son but I am also proud he given his life for the country.”

Javra’s wife Jingi often fainted and had to be given medical attention.Their eldest daughter Sandhya, who is in class VIII, came to know of his death after she returned home from school. “Only our uncle is there to take care of us,” she said, choking on her words, while relatives consoled her sisiters Sushma and Shilpa.
It was only on Sunday that power was restored to the village after a month, having been disconnected thanks to a defunct transformer. “We watched TV and I got concerned because I knew the attack was in Uri. But there was no way to confirm it. So rather than spread panic, I did not tell anyone,” said veteran Topno. Javra used to work in a cement godown before he joined the Army in 2005."

Needling Narendra Modi over the Uri terror attack, Shiv Sena on Monday said the situation has become worse than that under the previous Congress regime and if the Prime Minister is unable to strike Pakistan and eliminate terrorists, his exercise of building a global image will prove futile.
The Sena also called for dissolution of the government in Jammu and Kashmir and imposition of martial law in the state to sternly deal with the terrorists and pro-Pakistan elements.
Striking a hawkish posture, Sena said Pakistan has waged an open war against India with this attack and our attempt to gather proof of its involvement will yield no result internationally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“One has to accept that the situation today is worse than what was during the Congress regime. At a time when pro-Pakistan sloganeering is on in Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistani flags are being hoisted there, the Centre should dissolve the state government and impose ‘martial law’ there as President’s (Governor’s) rule wouldn’t suffice,” Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
“Pakistan has waged an open war against India now, while we cannot do anything except issue warnings. The probe into the Pathankot terror attack too did not result in any action against that country,” it said.
“Why are we searching for proof of Pakistan’s involvement in this terror attack? This proof has no value at the international level. If you (Modi) do not have the courage to strike Pakistan like the US did to eliminate Osama Bin Laden, there is no use of building an international image,” it added.

Stating that foreign nations would not do anything to help India on the issue, it said that if Pakistan could use four terrorists to wreak havoc why India cannot use its security forces to strike Pakistan.
The Sena said that merely decorating coffins of martyred soldiers or accepting condolences from foreign nations would not serve the purpose. Instead, giving credence to our security forces is the need of the hour.
“Terrorist attacks have become regular in Jand K. Whose failure is this? Modi may continue to issue warnings but the question is how much and when would Pakistan pay heed to them?” the Sena said.
Heavily armed militants suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM had yesterday stormed an army base in Uri in Kashmir, killing 17 jawans.
India had reacted strongly to the deadliest attack on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir that sparked an outrage with the Prime Minister strongly condemning it."

(Source: AP)
It was not long ago when he funded and organised a cleric-dominated Defence of Pakistan Council “long march” of cars from Lahore to Islamabad to protest the government’s getting lazy on Kashmir, fortified by the presence of ex-ISI chief General (retd) Hamid Gul riding in one of the Prados. On January 31, Hafiz Saeed of Jamaat-ud-Dawa was “house-arrested” under Section 11-EEE(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1977, and asked to live in his well-appointed Al Qadisiya headquarters before being shifted to the even more comfortable environs of Johar Town in Lahore.
Did Pakistan get scared of President Donald Trump, who may put Pakistan on the blacklist of countries in the International Cooperative Review Group (ICRG) and impose trade sanctions? No, an army spokesman said, the decision was taken in “national interest”, not under UN Resolution 1267 which lists Hafiz Saeed as a terrorist. Maverick TV host Shahid Masood appeared on the anti-government BOL TV channel to opine that Hafiz Saeed was, in fact, respectfully asked to accept security against planned attacks, coming, according to intercepted messages, from Afghanistan — read Taliban, funded by India — to get rid him. Michael Kugelman of the Woodrow Wilson Center wrote in Dawn (February 1) that it was really China that wanted Saeed in the jug, fearing his mindless vituperation against India might jeopardise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
In the early 2000s, Saeed was asked to temporarily stay at home by the-then ruling General Pervez Musharraf, a request Saeed didn’t like; today, Musharraf is in exile, running away from a treason trial in Pakistan. And Saeed is today the most powerful man running charities and educational facilities all over Pakistan. He has networks in 260 cities across the country; his Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) — declared terrorist by the US — is the largest NGO

in Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Karachi headquarters of Jamaat-ud-Dawa is spread over 2.5 acres of land worth billions of rupees. Guarded by armed men, the complex is located opposite the Safari park at University Road. Saeed employs 245 professors, 523 doctors and 1,942 members of paramedical staff associated with the FIF, to say nothing of the manpower in his colleges and kindergartens, topped by a university in Karachi. The foundation is running 35 different operations across the country. It includes hospitals, dispensaries, disaster management, ambulance services, medical camps, food management, coffin carriers, fire tenders, first-aid rescue, water rescue, water projects, blood banks, a blood donor society, vaccination programmes, laboratories, save vision, distribution of sacrificial meat, distribution of clothes, blankets and bedding, prisoners’ programmes, technical courses and rescue and training workshops.
The team of FIF volunteers was the first to reach the site of the recently crashed PIA aircraft near Abbottabad. It is present in the Tharparkar desert, digging wells for a thirsty Hindu community, and in Balochistan’s terrorist-haunted districts. Jamaat-ud-Dawa has 2,00,000 men ready to obey all commands and one wouldn’t be far wrong in surmising that he could run Pakistan better than the politicians — and win all the wars with India.
Anyone who has visited his headquarters on old Lake Road in Lahore would note the name he’s given to the place: Masjid Qadisiya, insultingly, after Qadisiya where Islam defeated Iran in the early days of the faith. Hafiz Saeed is Ahle Hadith, or Wahhabi in common parlance, educated in Saudi Arabia — some say he has a Saudi wife — and is supposed to have met up with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda’s founder Abdullah Azzam there. When the two shifted to Peshawar to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Saeed opened his own Dawat wal-Irshad jihadi office next to their office. (Later, Irshad morphed into Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is now a terrorist outfit still killing people in Afghanistan.)
Confessions by Ajmal Kasab — the boy from near Lahore who was one of the 10 terrorists who attacked Mumbai in 2008 — dubbed Saeed as the mind behind the 26/11 assault that killed over 160 innocent people. The UN declared Lashkar-e-Taiba as a terrorist organisation, but Saeed changed the name and got the Lahore High Court to declare its newly named version — Jamaat-ud-Dawa — as kosher because of “lack of evidence”. Pakistan was, however, forced to prosecute Hafiz Saeed’s most important lieutenant Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi as the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, only to let him walk because of “lack of evidence”.
The latest outrage was the terrorist attack last year in Uri, which, India determined from the GPS found on the killers, had emanated from a camp inside Pakistan and was carried out by Jamaat-ud-Dawa. As Pakistan denied it, Praveen Swami of The Indian Express published the photo of a poster in October 2016 by Jamaat-ud-Dawa, announcing the funeral in absentia of the “martyr” of the Uri attack, at Gujranwala.
It said: “We will pray for Muhammad Anas alias Abu Saraqa who killed 177 Hindu soldiers at Uri and the janaza will be addressed by killer-of-pagans Hafiz Saeed.” Pakistan can’t dump Hafiz Saeed because he is too big organisationally and funding-wise. His outreach is comparable to Fethullah Gulen who controls the Turkish mind, but Saeed went one better — successfully running stealth courts handing down punishments, 5,500 cases in Lahore alone, and he takes on India while the politicians are quaking in their shoes."

Pakistan violated ceasefire yet again on Thursday in Arnia Sector of Jammu and Kashmir’s RS Pura, hours after it bombarded the same area with heavy mortar shelling, news agency ANI reported. BSF is retaliating, as per reports.
Earlier in the day, Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy mortar shelling in Arnia and R S Pura sectors. Sources told the Indian Express that maximum damage was done to Muslim Gujjars and some houses in the area were also partially damaged. The sources added that the Pakistani Rangers were firing 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells.
On Wednesday, an Army soldier was killed and two others were injured in firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC) in Keran sector of Jammu and Kashmir. “An army man identified as sepoy Rajesh Khatri sustained bullet injuries in the Pakistani troops firing. He was airlifted to army hospital in Srinagar, where he succumbed to injuries,” the official was quoted as saying.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ever since the Army carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC), there has been an increase in the casualties suffered by the security forces, the number of militants killed and a sharp rise in the ceasefire violations. According to government data, 110 militants were killed by the Army between January and September last year (the surgical strikes took place on the morning of September 29, 2016).
On September, 2016, the Army’s Special Forces carried out “surgical strikes” on terror launch pads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to the Uri attack by militants that left 17 soldiers dead."

He confirmed and said that the channel would be going for serious revamp in its broadcast now. Following the recent Uri attack which snowballed into a major conflict between the two nations, the film workers association of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had on Friday asked all Pakistani artists working in India to immediately leave the country.  “We gave a 48-hour deadline to Pakistani actors and artists to leave India or MNS will push them out,” Amey Khopkar of MNS Chitrapat Sena had said. Khopkar had also threatened to beat up Pakistani artists, including those filmmakers who cast them in their productions. This was with major reference to Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan. “Pakistani kalakaar toh maar khaayenge hi, saath mein jo yahan producer/director hain unko bhi peetenge (Pakistani artists will be beaten up and so will the producers and directors),” he said.

Pakistani artists including Fawad Khan, Mahira Khan, Atif Aslam, Ali Zafar and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan are the main target of MNS. While Fawad will next be seen in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, apart from a Dharma Productions’ film opposite Katrina Kaif, Mahira is set to make her Bollywood debut in SRK’s Raees. Other artists also keep travelling to India for work. As soon as the news calling for a ban on all these artists came out, Twitter got divided into two groups. Trends like #SayNoToPakArtists, #BoycottPakOrNot and #KickOutPakis also started doing the rounds. While there are some people who find it absolutely unnecessary to ban the artists because that’s not going to solve the problem of terrorism, there are some who fully support it and believe boycotting Pakistan will be a lesson to the country."

For all those who’ve been missing Pakistani heartthrobs Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan on the Indian screens, this might quench your thirst. The two stars might not be working together in a film anytime soon, but they have been captured in the same frame after a long time, and hence making headlines. After her grand debut in Bollywood opposite Shah Rukh Khan in this year’s Raees, Mahira’s next project is Pakistani film Hoh Mann Jahaan which will have its world TV premiere on March 23. And like many of her industry friends, even Fawad is promoting her film.

It is needless to say that Mahira and Fawad made the best onscreen pair in their blockbuster TV show Humsafar, which did wonders in both India and Pakistan. The two actors have been captured together yet again. Mahira took to Twitter to share a picture with Fawad, with the caption, “#Homannjahaan 23rd of a march on ARY. Tune in y’all.” Other Pakistani actors Adeel Hussain and Sheheryar Munawar are also seen in this click.

Fawad Khan recently made news when pictures of his new beefed-up look broke the internet. One of the pictures was shared by Pakistani actor Mikaal Zulfiqar on Facebook too. Fawad’s next project is Pakistani action-drama, Maula Jatt 2, and as per Mikal’s caption, the actor has worked really hard for this role. He has hit the gym and undergone a physical transformation for the role.

Mahira and Fawad share a close friendship and have been spotted at several events. The two became a household name in India as well, after their drama Humsafar aired on Zindagi channel. Both were lauded for their natural performances and looks. However, the strained relations between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of Uri attack made it impossible for the two to work in Bollywood. Fawad, who was last seen in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, in an interview said that he is still in touch with his Bollywood friends."

Days after cricketer Gautam Gambhir said the martyrs of Uri attack deserve a biopic rather than any cricketer, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story director Neeraj
Pandey says a filmmaker should talk about every issue. Gambhir recently posted a tweet that the 17 soldiers who were killed in the terrorist attack in Uri deserved a biopic as they are the best inspiration of those who laid their lives for the country.
More from the world of Entertainment:

 
The cricketer also uploaded a picture with a quote taken from an earlier interview, criticising making a film on the lives of cricketers. When asked about this, Neeraj told reporters, “I’ve made films on both. We make stories. It’s not that every film should be of a particular genre or anything like that. I think as storytellers we need to talk about everything.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“This story is about the hero in us. It’s a very motivational inspiring story. That can come from anyone. And MS (Dhoni) is a serving Lt Colonel in the Indian Army. So that should answer your questions,” he said. Actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who plays the titular role in “MS Dhoni: The Untold Story”, feels it all depends on

whether a story is worth telling or not.
“Films are made on stories. I’ve played an engineer five times in the theatre. The story wasn’t on an engineer, but the inherent story. If the story is worth telling, then you can play anything,” he said. The duo was speaking at the launch of “Har Gully Mein Dhoni” song. The “Baby” helmer said the idea behind the special music video was to celebrate the film and give an ode to Dhoni.
Neeraj also said that Dhoni has seen the film and liked it. “We both were silent for about ten minutes after we had seen the film. That goes to say he must’ve liked it. There was nothing to say,” he said.
The film is set to release on September 30.

Stepping up the pressure in the wake of the Uri attack, the Congress on Monday asked the Centre to cut down the strength of the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi and scale down New Delhi’s presence in Islamabad as well. It also asked the government to convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the security situation and to declare Pakistan a terrorist state.
“Extreme situations demand extreme decisions,” said Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi. Stating that the Centre’s response has been unsatisfactory so far, he said: “By now, Pakistan should have been declared a terrorist state. We demand that a special one or two-day session of Parliament be called to discuss the security situation and, more particularly, to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. We demand near absolute economic sanctions against Pakistan… We demand the considerable scaling down of Pakistan High Commission in Delhi and vice versa of our mission there.”

The Congress adopted a hawkish approach on the Indus water treaty too. The party said that while Article 62 of the Vienna convention provides for withdrawal, there are methods that are “short of withdrawal also”. Singhvi said India can construct more dams, which are allowed under the treaty and which can affect Pakistan, within the permissible limits of the treaty. “There are a menu of options… all we are saying is that we cannot be silent spectators to muscular jingoism every day with zero action on the ground,” Singhvi said.
“India is looking weak… the nation wants concrete action against the rogue state of Pakistan, flourishing both under the government and military of that country… Aimless political strategy is not a synonym for strategic restraint… strategic restraint in the face of grave provocation should not mean the absence of a strategic response… the Prime Minister’s speech itself demonstrates strategic ambiguity and not strategic response,” he said. “We do not want this to lead to strategic confusion, making India a laughing stock of the world or of Pakistan.”

The Congress also asked the government to embark on a course of “vehement lobbying” across the world, with every major power which provides aid or has economic cooperation with Pakistan, and withdraw the Most Favoured Nation status accorded to Pakistan. “Why is there delay in considering and finalising the asylum request of Baloch leader Brahumdagh Bugti. Why keep it hanging? If you have reason not to grant it, reject it. But otherwise, why keep it hanging?” said Singhvi."

(PTI Photo)
In a first, India and the European Union (EU) have named three globally proscribed terrorists — Hafiz Saeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim — in their joint statement and shown convergence in views to combat terrorism. While Saeed and Lakhvi are accused of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, Dawood is accused of the 1993 Mumbai blasts.The announcement was made following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting European Council President Donald Franciszek Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the 14th India-EU summit here.
Naming of the three terrorists, who have conducted terror attacks in India leading to hundreds of deaths, is being perceived as a significant takeaway from the India-EU summit. A separate joint statement on “cooperation in combating terrorism” said, “The leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation to take decisive and concerted actions against globally proscribed terrorists and terror entities, including Hafeez Saeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar-e-Tayibba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, Haqqani Network, Al Qaeda, ISIS (Da’esh) and their affiliates.”
During the 13th India-EU summit in March 2016, the joint statement had only mentioned the terror outfits. Addressing a joint press event with the EU leaders, Modi said, “We have agreed to strengthen our security cooperation and work together against terrorism. We will not only further strengthen our bilateral cooperation on this issue, but will also increase our cooperation and coordination in multilateral fora.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tusk said, “We have adopted a joint declaration on counter-terrorism in which we agreed to counter violent extremism and radicalisation, particularly online, and to deal effectively with the threat by foreign terrorist fighters, terrorist financing and arms supply.” After the muted response to the Uri attack last year, the joint statement made amends and mentioned the “recent terror attacks in Pathankot, Uri, Nagrota, Anantnag (Amarnath Yatra), Srinagar, Paris, Brussels, Nice, London, Stockholm, Manchester, Barcelona, Turku, and other terrorist attacks”.
It said that “recalling the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, the leaders called for the perpetrators of these attacks to be brought to justice. They further called for greater unity, stronger international partnership and concerted action by the international community in addressing the menace of terrorism.”
There was, however, no major headway on the much-delayed free trade pact. Juncker said, “It is the time for a Free Trade Agreement between India and the European Union — (but) once the conditions are right, and only when the conditions are right, we resume (talks). Today’s summit is an important step in the right direction.”

He said that chief negotiators from the two sides will chart the way forward in the coming days. The joint statement said the leaders expressed their shared commitment to strengthening the economic partnership between India and the EU. It noted the ongoing efforts of both sides to “re-engage actively towards timely relaunching negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial India-EU Broad Based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA)”.
On the issue of Rohingyas, the joint statement said India and the EU expressed “deep concern” at the recent spate of violence in the Rakhine state of Myanmar, which has resulted in the outflow of a large number of people from the state, many of whom have sought shelter in Bangladesh.
“Both sides took note that this violence was triggered by a series of attacks by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militants, which led to loss of lives amongst the security forces as well as civilian population,” the joint statement said. “Both sides recognised the need for ending the violence and restoring normalcy in the Rakhine state without any delay.”"

After days of speculations about when will Fawad Khan open up about the lingering issue around the ban of Pakistani artistes in Bollywood, the actor has spoken up! In an official post on Facebook, the Pakistani heartthrob explained his sudden departure from India and why he has so far remained silent on the entire matter. He has also thrashed all recent reports which claimed that Fawad has given a disappointing statement against India on his return to Pakistan. Fawad was among a list of Pakistani artistes, who were targetted by the MNS in the aftermath of the Uri attack. MNS had demanded a ban on Fawad along with Mahira Khan, Atif Aslam and Ali Zafar in Bollywood and even threatened them to go back within 48 hours.

Fawad had flown back to Lahore few days back, as his wife Sadaf was expecting the couple’s second child. Sadaf gave birth to a baby girl late on Tuesday. Fawad’s manager had confirmed the report to Pakistani media. Now, sensing that Fawad has got some time out from his family stuff, he has taken to Facebook to post his statement. He wrote:
I’ve been in Lahore since July as my wife and I had been expecting our second child. I’ve received numerous requests from the media and from well wishers worldwide asking me for my thoughts on the sad incidents that took place in the past few weeks. As a father of two little children, I pray and wish like many others that together we can build and live in a more peaceful world. I believe we owe it to our children who will shape our tomorrow. This is the first time I have spoken on the matter. Please disregard any other words attributed to me during this time because I have not said them. I thank all my fans and fellow artists from Pakistan, India and people in general all over the world who have shown continued support for their belief in love and understanding to unite a divisive world.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Check out the post here.

Fawad’s statement comes a day after two other Pakistan artistes — singer Shafqat Amanat Ali and actor Mawra Hocane, condemned the Uri attacks and showed concern over the rising terror strikes on the border. While Fawad’s post talks about peace, without supporting any nation in specific. But he does make a point!"

(PTI Photo)
Twenty years after granting Pakistan the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status in 1996, India now proposes to review it in response to the September 18 Uri attack in which 18 soldiers died. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting on Thursday with senior officials from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of External Affairs to weigh India’s options on trade-related relations with Pakistan, official sources said.
The proposal to review the MFN status comes close on the heels of a similar meeting called by the Prime Minister Monday on the Indus Waters Treaty between the two countries. At that meeting, he told officials “rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta” (blood and water cannot flow together).
Watch What Else Is Making News

The MFN status, contrary to what the name suggests, does not accord any special treatment to Pakistan. By granting MFN status, India just committed itself to non-discrimination; in other words, it committed to treat Pakistan the same way as it would treat every other WTO member country in terms of tariff being imposed on goods. In fact, each WTO member treats all other members equally as “most favoured” trading partners.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pakistan has, however, not reciprocated and has resisted granting India the same MFN status, on the pretext that trade normalisation takes away the leverage Islamabad has during the composite dialogue between the two countries.
The issue of Pakistan not granting MFN status has long been raised at bilateral discussions between the two countries. In fact, a deal was almost clinched in 2012 during the visit of the then Minister of Commerce and Industry, Anand Sharma, to Pakistan. However, domestic political developments in Pakistan and opposition from radical elements had held back the government from announcing it.
India-Pakistan trade has been much below potential despite the signing of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement in January 2004 when NDA-I was in power and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister. In the last 10 years, two-way trade has crawled to $2.7 billion in 2014 from $600 million in 2004. In 2015-16, India exported merchandise worth $2.17 billion, making up just 0.82 per cent of its total exports. Imports from Pakistan were $441.03 million, or 0.11 per cent of India’s total imports.
In fact, India enjoys a favourable trade balance with Pakistan. In 2015-16, India had a trade surplus of $1.73 billion. Principal exports from India include vegetables and raw cotton. Indian traders claim while Pakistan may have nothing to lose if trade is blocked, it will cut off a big alternative market for Indian farmers, especially from Punjab."

With 10 days having elapsed since the terror attack on the army camp in Uri, the surgical strikes by the Army along the LoC on Thursday came at a time when India was least expecting it. A military action was least expected from the government which so far seemed to be looking for diplomatic options to tighten the noose around Pakistan. But the Army stood by its word and gave Pakistan a reply “at the place and time of our choice”.
Though the Indian Army didn’t elaborate much on the attack of release pictures or videos, the contradicting statements from Pakistan made it clear that they had indeed been on the receiving end of strong military action from the Indian forces. In the morning, Pakistani media flashed news about two of their soldiers being killed by India in violation of the ceasefire. Though it was seen as a regular hue and cry by Pakistan, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, the Director General Military Operations (DGMO), told the media about the Army’s overnight operation on terrorist launchpads.

Congratulatry message to the Army and pictures of celebrations from across India were seen across social media platforms, but many remain unsatisfied seking concrete evidence of the type American showcased after the strike that killed Osama Bin Laden in Abotabad. Well, considering the nature of the strike, there might not be an videos of the action and expecting Pakistan to acknowledge the damage is pointless.
At first, Pakistan rubbished the reports of surgical strike as fabrication of truth, news agency ANI later quoted prime minister Nawaz Sharif as saying he condemned the strike by Indian forces. So condemnation and contradictions came almost in a span of a few hours. Then came the denouncement of Pakistan government by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairperson Imran Khan who vowed to give a befiting reply to Narendra Modi, something which Sharif couldn’t. Khan said he will show his prime minister Nawaz Sharif how to react to such aggressions. This made even Pakistani media confused what had actually happened. Very soon Sharif called for a meeting of federal cabinet to discuss the growing tensions between India and Pakistan, making the picture clear.
Back in India, people living within 10 kms of the border with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab were asked to shift to safer places and schools ordered to be shut anticipating retaliation by Pakistani forces in the wake of surgical strike. The ‘Beating Retreat’ ceremony at Attari-Wagah border in Amritsar in Punjab was also cancelled and tourists told to return.
But what added sheen to the success of the strike was the Opposition’s reaction. From Congress to Left and regional parties, all hailed Army’s surgical strike and priased government’s action to “protect the country’s security and deal with the menace of terrorism from across the border.” The action taken by the government will surely have its repercussion in the coming days, but it has certainly calmed the outrage after the Uri attack."

People of four villages in Maharashtra turned up in large number to share the grief of the families of four bravehearts from the state, who were among the 18 jawans martyred in the Uri terror attack.
Sandip Somnath Thok (24) from Nashik district, Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati, lost their lives in yesterday’s attack.
Villagers of Jashi in Mann tehsil of Satara district made a beeline to the house of Galande ever since the news of his killing reached the village. Galande’s brothers Manjya Bapu and Keshav are also in the armed forces.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The family has a home on the outskirts of the village, where the slain soldier’s wife and two children live.
Now, villagers are waiting for the mortal remains to reach Jashi by road, after being flown to Pune.
At Khandagali village in Nashik district, the family of armyman Sandip Somnath Thok, killed in the Uri attack, is mourning for the soldier, who was a bachelor.
Sandip is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters. Somnath, father of the 25-year old, is an onion farmer.
Sandip had joined the Army in 2014, after repeated attempts to join the armed forces. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces.
Villagers are awaiting the arrival of the martyr’s mortal remains for the last rites.
Purad Nerad in Wani tehsil of Yavatmal district is mourning the death of Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe.
Vikas, who joined the Army in 2008 and was transferred to the camp at Uri six months ago, had got married two years back. He is survived by his wife Sneha (23), his four-month old daughter, younger brother and parents.
His body would be flown from Delhi to Nagpur tonight and would be taken to his native village by road.
Meanwhile, the mortal remains of Vikas Janrao Uike is being brought to his native Nandgaon Khandeshwar town in Amravati district for funeral.
Uike, who joined Bihar Battalion at Chandrapur in 2009, had served in Assam and Bengal, before being posted in Jammu-Kashmir three months ago. He leaves behind his parents, a brother and a married sister.
His father Janrao said, they were planning to marry him off soon. “We had planned to solemnise the engagement in Diwali, but all our plans have been shattered,” he told reporters.
The grief-stricken residents of Nandgaon Khandeshwar town observed a spontaneous bandh today and even burnt a Pakistani flag."

On Wednesday, as my phone crackled almost endlessly with people asking for my assessment of what was likely to happen between India and Pakistan, I was reminded of a conversation I had in 1994 with Hizbul Mujahideen’s Syed Salahuddin. He was then of the view that India and Pakistan must have a war. When probed further about such an evil wish his response was that a war would weaken both countries but it would facilitate his HuM to fight a weak India. Salahuddin was probably an earlier version of Dr Strangelove. There are newer versions out there who happily talk about a nuclear war scenario in which the presence of nuclear deterrence weakens New Delhi’s resolve to launch a surprise attack on Pakistan. It is the understanding amongst the security community in Islamabad that New Delhi has far more to lose in risking an attack even on suspected terror camps inside Pakistan.
Despite such confidence, the military did not leave things to fate and increased the threat level. Apparently, a section of the Peshawar-Islamabad motorway was blocked to practice landing fighter aircraft and troops from Corps I, II and XXXI were ordered to move to the borders. The objective: To stall a possible Indian retaliatory attack targeting territories inside Pakistan. The Pakistan Army takes India’s Cold Start doctrine very seriously and believes that its counterpart may try to strike territories inside Pakistan in response to some terrorist attack. Thus, instead of waiting for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to send a message, it was the army chief, General Raheel Sharif, who promptly announced that: “The armed forces of Pakistan are fully prepared to respond to the entire spectrum of direct and indirect threats.” However, none of this excitement was visible in Islamabad or other cities in Punjab such as Lahore and Muridke that have major centres for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)/Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) network. Similarly, there wasn’t a sense of panic in Bahawalpur, a city that has the headquarters for Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). It was days after the Pathankot attack that a couple of JeM sites were shut down and people relocated elsewhere. Striking the right target would require precise intelligence and the capability to safely carry out a hit-and-run operation. But as Pakistan’s military establishment believes, “Pakistan is not Afghanistan and India is not the US”. It is expected that despite heating up the rhetoric, PM Modi would not use a military option. Despite using fashionable decision-making tools like war gaming, neither side has correctly calculated how the escalation spiral will work and what would be the best place to put the lid back on, once the Pandora’s Box is opened.
This is a battle which will have to be fought diplomatically and internationally. Both sides will try to convince the world that they are actually the victim and not the aggressor. Within days after the Uri attack, the conversation amongst some in the diplomatic circle in Islamabad was that Pakistan indeed did not have a reason to carry out an attack especially a few days before the UNGA session. Why would Nawaz Sharif lose a wonderful opportunity to draw international attention towards India’s gross human rights violations in Kashmir by facilitating such an attack? Although Delhi would have to make an effort to come up with the right evidence to convince the world, some of the more rational minds in Pakistan were indeed worried. Three senior retired ambassadors, for instance, were quick to write an analysis pleading with the government to de-link itself from the various terror groups that continue to operate inside the country. If Pakistan’s intent is to raise the Kashmir issue at international forums and fight the battle diplomatically, it stands little chance as major power centres are not convinced that Pakistan is nothing but a hapless victim of terror. Recently, an EU delegation asked Raheel Sharif about why, in his view, the world was not entirely convinced of Rawalpindi’s efforts. Notwithstanding the fact that the question left him humming and hawing, he believes that the country can survive in such a diplomatic battle by seeking out newer alignments and non-Western allies. China is now the Pakistan army and its security elite’s revived romance, which they believe, would conveniently fill the gap of an ever-weakening love affair with Washington. To put it in the words of a popular tweeter: The old equation of the army, America and Allah determining life in Pakistan is now replaced with a new one — China, COAS and Cashmere.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
There is also little likelihood of a pressure build-up domestically. As life goes on as normal there is little awareness of what may happen in case of escalation of tension. The media on both sides of the border seems to be telling its own story and reporting imagined gains made internationally. While in India it may seem that Pakistan is about to be condemned internationally as a terrorist state and face sanctions, Pakistan’s rhetoric is regarding how successfully the state is drawing the attention of the international community towards Indian atrocities in Kashmir. Such deliberate reporting and analysis has far-reaching effects as it retards the formation of any strong lobbies inside the country that would advocate peace instead of war. Perhaps, the only increasingly ineffective lobby remains the present civilian government that was never part of aiding or abetting terrorism and remains innocent of doing so. The problem is that the prime minister is too weak to control other institutions of the state that consider the escalation of tension to a point where it raises worries of a limited war escalating to a nuclear war as manna from heaven. This means drawing international attention towards the Kashmir issue and making the international community realise that South Asia may be a more peaceful place once the issue is resolved. While the Pakistani state is in violation of human rights in Balochistan, the understanding is that India’s pleading the case will not matter, as all states violate human rights. However, Kashmir is also a bilateral dispute and conflict around it has a better chance of catching the world’s eye. The generals are not likely to deviate from this standpoint even for the sake of the economy. Islamabad is a comfortably aid-dependent capital. Economic growth is part of the political government’s longer-term wish list, but in the short term, it only hopes to win the 2018 elections. Such an equation means that it is happy to remain aid-dependent and is insulated from the fear of major setback to the economy. The real Sharif, as General Raheel Sharif is referred to by some in Pakistan, is not likely to be deterred by the argument regarding economic pressure or an impending meltdown.
Sadly, in both India and Pakistan, war and peace are used to make political gains. The reality is that it is a losing battle for both. Perhaps there is a need for Pakistani generals and Indian politicians to think carefully about an out of the box approach to resolving the unresolvable."

In the wake of escalating tension between India and Pakistan after the Uri attack, activists have been running campaigns on roads and on social media platform to boycott products from ‘Pakistan’s friend’ China.
A trade body has ascertained that there has been a 30-40 per cent impact on goods like decorative lights which records huge sales during Diwali, whereas a slight impact has also been felt on China-made electronic goods.
“In an internal survey, we found that the sale of decorative Chinese lights and other similar products has declined by 30-40 per cent in recent days. Demand of electronic items like LCDs and others made in China has also declined by 10-15 per cent while this impact is 2 per cent on mobile phones,” Suresh Agrawal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI), told reporters. He said that FORTI has been conducting an internal survey for the past several days and members of the federation are giving their feedback on the demand and sale of Chinese products.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Consumption of Chinese products has come down in recent days. Be it decorative items or any other product, people are preferring Indian products over Chinese goods. Looking at the trend, traders are also avoiding placing orders for Chinese goods,” Ajay Vijayvargiya, Secretary of Jaipur Vyapar Mahasangh, said. Shyam Meena, a decorative light trader from the walled city area, also acknowledged the decline in sale.
“The sale is no doubt down this time. Most of the customers are demanding Indian lights. The impact of the call to boycott Chinese products is high. Last year, I ordered goods worth Rs 10 lakh approximately, but I have not ordered that much (this year),” he said.
Large number of Chinese products ranging from idols, portraits of Hindu Gods and Goddesses to decorative lights which bear no indication of the product being manufactured in China are in the market at cheaper prices, yet people are showing awareness in purchasing the items, said Sandeep Gupta, an activist.
Gupta, a chartered accountant by profession, takes out a few hours every day to go to the streets and markets to call for the boycott of Chinese products. “Shaheedon ko de do Shradhanjali, China ke Samano ko do Tilanjali (Pay homage to the martyrs, boycott products from

China)” is the slogan written on a banner which he carries with him on a jeep. Chinese products are sometimes very difficult to identify. The list of Chinese products is very long and people as well as traders will have to show awareness against them. The impact will be visible when the market of electronic goods will be affected,” he said.
Gupta added that the young generation is quite aware on this issue. “Why should we buy Chinese products, a friend of Pakistan? We will buy Desi things,” an engineering student, Bhaskar Verma, said."

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday condemned the terror attack on an army base in Uri and said better facilities including “fire retardant” tents should be given to the soldiers after it came to light that at least 13 jawans died due to the fire in their tents.
“While we work out who is to blame for #Uri & what an appropriate response will be, do we not owe our troops flame retardant tents & huts?”
“If the reports are correct and 13 of the 17 fatalities are because of burns, it’s a crying shame that fire retardant tents aren’t the norm,” Omar said in a series of tweets about the Uri terror attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The National Conference working president also criticised the “fancy” facilities for the Army officers while the jawans

were being taken for granted.
“The mess will be made more fancy, the auditorium more modern, officers quarters more comfortable but the jawan will be taken for granted. We owe it to our jawans to give them the best that we can because they are the 1st to lay down their lives and sacrifice everything for us,” he said.
Omar prayed for peace to the souls of the jawans killed in the attack on the army base in Uri area of Baramulla district.
He strongly condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the families of the martyred jawans, extending heartfelt condolences to them.
“This is a highly condemnable and tragic incident. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyred jawans who have lost their lives and pray for the speedy recovery of those who have sustained injuries in the attack,” Omar said in a statement here."

Why is there an impression that Pakistan’s election is a set-piece by the Army, and that it will score no matter who wins?
Unlike in the elections of 2008 and 2013, there is a strong perception this time that the Pakistan Army is pulling strings behind the scenes to ensure that the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) does not return to power. Nawaz Sharif had seemed doomed from the time of the Dawn leak in October 2016 — the daily reported the details of a meeting among select members of the civilian government and the military brass, during which Nawaz’s brother, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, purportedly challenged the Army’s ties to jihadists. The report came when India-Pakistan ties were at their lowest after the Uri attack and India’s retaliatory surgical strike.
Pakistan Election 2018 LIVE UPDATES

After the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz in the Panama Papers case, he alleged that the military had got rid of him through a “judicial coup”. He blamed the spate of exits of “electable” PML (N) leaders in South Punjab on the “khalai makhlook”, or extraterrestrials, and “farishtey”, or angels, thinly veiled references to the intelligence agencies. Many of those who left joined Imran Khan’s PTI. Across the country, 143 Independents are contesting — many are former PML (N) members, and all have the same election symbol — the jeep. Among the jeepwallahs is Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan, Nawaz’s Interior Minister who is close to the Army.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Read | What do the elections foretell for India-Pak relations?
New parties with clear or apparent ties to the military have appeared suddenly. In Balochistan, the Army is alleged to be helping the Balochistan Awami Party, which was born this March. The funeral of a BAP candidate killed in the Mastung bomb blast was attended by the Army Chief. In Karachi, the two-year-old Pakistan Sarzameen Party is seeking to replace the MQM, which has earned the wrath of the military. In Sindh province, a new formation called Grand Democratic Alliance, with many prominent former PPP members, is seeking to cut into PPP votes. The PPP, too, has a bad history with the Army.
The Laskhar-e-Taiba/Jamat-ud-Dawa, nurtured by the Pak Army for operations in India, has fielded candidates — including the UN-designated terrorist son-in-law of Hafiz Saeed, Hafiz Khalid Waleed. Their political front, Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek, was cleared by the Election Commission to contest, even though an earlier front had been denied permission. Another designated terrorist, Aurangzeb Farooqi of the anti-Shia group AWSJ, is contesting, as his boss, Mohammed Ahmed Ludhianvi, who was mysteriously taken off a Pakistan government anti-terrorist watchlist.
Hameed Haroon, CEO of the Dawn group, has alleged in an extraordinary interview to the BBC that the Army had built pressure on media groups, and not allowed his newspaper to be distributed in cantonments. Anti-military social media bloggers and activists have been disappearing mysteriously. Most recently, an Islamabad High Court judge alleged that the ISI had asked the Chief Justice of the court to keep Nawaz and his daughter Maryam in prison until the elections.

Has the Army reacted to the allegations? 
Director-General, Inter Services Public Relations Major General Asif Ghafoor, has denied the judge’s allegations, and asked the Supreme Court to investigate them. He said the military was only carrying out law and order duties mandated by the Election Commission, and had no “direct” role in the elections. Earlier this month, he had asked the media to consider the “country larger interest”, and displayed a chart featuring “anti-Pakistan” tweets by some media personalities — a statement that was read as a threat against those who did not subscribe to the Army’s line.

But what does the Army gain by stopping Nawaz’s party? 
The Army’s preeminence is dependent on Pakistan remaining a security state. India is a key element in the Pakistan Army’s self-projection. Any politician who challenges the Army threatens its vast interests, including its ties with foreign militaries and governments, and its business interests.
Nawaz the politician was a child of the Zia establishment, but he has been at daggers drawn with the Army since 1997, when in his second term as Prime Minister, he asserted himself to choose General Pervez Musharraf as his Chief. The Army was not happy with his overtures to India and the Lahore Declaration, and he claims to have been kept out of the loop on Kargil.
Within months of becoming Prime Minister for a third time in 2013, Nawaz rattled the Army by putting Musharraf on trial for treason, and chose to brave the Army’s disapproval to attend the June 2014 inauguration of Narendra Modi. Subsequently, Sharif was himself rattled by the growing personality cult of his handpicked successor to Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Gen Raheel Sharif. Gen Sharif used Imran’s street protests in 2014 demanding Nawaz’s resignation to play the mediator, called for a “political solution” to the crisis, and also sending the message that the elected government should not mess with the Army. The December 2014 attack on the Peshawar Army School that killed over 100 children tightened the General’s grip, and the decision to go after militants in Waziristan turned him into a hero. By 2016, serious differences had developed between the Prime Minister and the General.

The Army would hate to see the PML (N) win this election, or even be a strong opposition. Nawaz has now taken on the role that Benazir Bhutto and the PPP had once claimed — that of the anti-Establishment leader and party.
In what ways has the Army tried to control earlier civilian governments in Pakistan? 
The Army, which describes its mission as safeguarding Pakistan’s ideological frontiers, has ruled directly for 30 years, and indirectly for the rest of the country’s history. It has always controlled national security and foreign policy.
In 2008, under Gen Kayani, the Army declared it was shedding the image it had come to acquire under Musharraf. It withdrew military officers from civilian postings, but reinvented itself to stay relevant as the “saviour” of the nation with an anti-Taliban operation in Swat. The Mumbai attacks were a turning point — the military managed to project an imminent military threat from India, and portrayed Pakistan as a victim of Indian aggression. It also beat back an early attempt by the PPP government to make the ISI answerable to civilian authority. Immediately after US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011, the military recovered from some of the humiliation through the “Memogate” episode, in which Pakistan’s then ambassador to Washington, Husain Haqqani, stood accused of colluding with the US against the Army.
The Army’s role in the dismissal of elected governments through the 1990s is well documented. A 1996 case, now known as Meherangate, is still being heard by the Supreme Court in which the ISI paid millions of rupees to help the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, a front led by Nawaz’s party, to win the election in 1990 against the PPP.
Read | Who is Imran Khan?
So why doesn’t the Army just run the country directly like it has done thrice in the past? 
The Pakistan Army craves popularity in the same way that elected politicians do, but it has learnt from experience that running the government and being accountable for bijli, paani, sadak — and for other failures — is the shortest route to earning the wrath of the people. Musharraf discovered that in five years. Power without responsibility is much more convenient."

Havildar Sanjay Kumar Yadav of 10 Medium Artillery Regiment, which is part of the Jhansi-based 31 Armoured Division, has been attached in 654 EME Battalion under 54 Infantry Division (RAPID) in Secunderabad for the court martial proceedings. Highly placed sources inform that the trial formally began on November 11.
The Commanding Officer of an infantry battalion has been appointed the presiding officer of the court martial with six other Army officers as members. The GCM is currently examining an officer of the Military Intelligence who is believed to have exposed the espionage racket.
Senior officers familiar with the case said that the intelligence branch got a tip-off that the Havildar was in constant touch with a woman on Facebook as well as Whatsapp. Since there are strict instructions regarding using social media platforms, the Army authorities started keeping an eye on his activities and later it was found that some unaccounted cash was also deposited in his bank account.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We learnt that a Pakistani agent was posing as a woman and indulging in sexually explicit chat with this jawan which included exchange of photographs. Further investigation revealed that an amount of Rs 1,38,000 had been deposited in his account in Bank of Baroda over a period of time from unknown sources and that the first such deposit was for an amount of Rs 8,000,” said an officer who did not want to be named. It is believed that the havildar was in touch with the Pakistani agent for a period of around nine months before he was detected.

Among the information that the havildar is accused of having passed on is the location of various units and the names and official appointments of certain officers in key positions. Sources in Army say that the involvement of other Army personnel in this case could not be ruled out though for the present there is only a confessional statement by the accused which is helping in his prosecution.
There have been several instances in the recent past in which serving military personnel have been found to have passed on sensitive information after falling for honeytraps on Facebook. Two Indian Air Force personnel were arrested in Bathinda and Pathankot in 2014 and 2015, respectively, after it was found that they were in touch with Pakistani agents who posed as women and lured them through fake profiles.
The Indian Express had earlier reported in July 2015 that the Military Intelligence had sounded warnings that fake profiles were being used on social networking sites in order to entice serving personnel and to extract confidential information from them which included the Order of Battle (ORBAT) of key strike formations. The Army had also found on an earlier occasion that three serving officers had passed on some information about units to a fake profile of ‘Simran’ on Facebook. Following this, strict guidelines have been issued giving out the manner in which social media is to be accessed and the precautions to be taken while interacting on them."

After announcing a film on the 2016 Uri attack and Meghna Gulzar’s biopic on Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, we have learned that filmmaker Ronnie Screwvala is now producing a film set in the world of blind cricket. Ronnie Screwvala’s motion picture company RSVP continues on its path of backing exceptional stories that need to be told. In a recent development, Screwvala announced their upcoming film is set in the world of blind cricket. Blind cricket is a version of cricket adapted for blind and partially sighted people.
Talking about the film, Ronnie Screwvala said, “The film is an inspirational sports drama set against this unique canvas. The backdrop helps tell an inspiring story about a character who never ceases to believe in the power of his dreams, despite the hurdles life throws his way.”
World Blind Cricket (WBC) is the governing body for blind cricket worldwide. The WBC has 10 full-time international teams namely India, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and Nepal. Team India is run by the Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI). The board is delighted a film is being made on the sport. “My greatest thanks to RSVP and Mr. Ronnie Screwvala for taking the initiative in making a movie on blind cricket, which is inspired by true events. I immensely appreciate the effort and am positive that this film will help make blind cricket more popular among the masses,” says Mr. G.K. Mahantesh – President, Cricket Association for the Blind in India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India is the dominant force in the sport across all formats – One-day internationals and Twenty20. Having won the World Cup consecutively in 2012 and 2017 – India has been at the pinnacle of the sport for the last decade. “We are world champions in cricket for the visually impaired. Very proud moment. Our story is with this backdrop and based on multiple true events of this sport. We need inspirational stories in our movies and role models in real life and I believe this narrative will do that and more and yet entertain and enthrall us at the core. Excited to collaborate with the CABI – Cricket Association for the Blind in India,” adds Screwvala.
When we tried checking for more details on who would be directing the film and who will be cast in the film, the RSVP team told us, “We do not have anything more to share. However, overall RSVP believes in strong narratives and we, therefore, focus on – stories that need to be told, stories that we would love to tell, stories that people go to the movies for. And for us the inspiration for this movie was that it is a story that must be told.”"

(PTI)
Heaping praise on India’s military prowess, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the country can defend itself and has convinced the world that the menace of terrorism needs to be eliminated. Speaking about India’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the LoC last year after the Uri attack, the Prime Minister said that these strikes were proof that the nation can stand up in its own defense when needed. Speaking at a community reception at the Ritz Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Modi said:”When India talked of terrorism 20 years back, many in the world said it was a law and order problem and didn’t understand it. Now terrorists have explained terrorism to them so we don’t have to.”

Highlighting the achievements of the NDA government in the last three years, Modi added: “When India conducted surgical strikes the world experienced our power and realised that India practices restrain but can show power when needed.” He stated that India has been a victim of terrorism but “we have succeeded in conveying to the world the deleterious effects of terrorism on India.”
Taking an apparent dig at neighbour China, the Prime Minister asserted that India believed in following the world order and will never achieve its goals by not following the global rules.He also said that the country has always followed the path of development within the confines of the global order and rule of law. In what could be an apparent reference to China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, Modi noted that following the global rules has always been India’s tradition and culture.He also promised to the Indian American community that he will fulfil their dreams of India’s development.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


Modi also pointed out that he has been relentlessly working towards fast-tracking India’s development, adding that there was no scope for corrupt and dishonest since Indians hate corruption. He added that his government is determined to address the menace of corruption. Boasting that there has been not even a single allegation of corruption levelled against his government since it came to power, Modi said that his government is using technology to develop a system where honesty is the common practice. The Prime Minister stated that technology plays a great role in keeping a check on corruption and said: “”The results are there for all to see.”
Talking about India’s development goals, the Prime Minister further said that his government is focused on setting high standards of development and setting the global benchmark. He also noted that infrastructure is essential for sustainable development. Praising the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and Sushma Swaraj for giving a human face to diplomacy and effective use of social media in good governance, Modi said:”MEA is one ministry of the government which has demonstrated through the use of social media, for the first time, that it cares for poorest of Indians.” He also assured the Indian-Americans that the Indian Embassy will always find a solution to any problem faced by them.

Shuaib Masoodi
The terrorists who attacked the Army post near the Line of Control in Uri Sunday could have used any of a number of infiltration routes that terrorists had used in the past, officials said. They had used one of these routes in carrying out a similar attack on an Army camp at Mohura, Uri, in December 2014, when eight Army men and three policemen were killed, besides six terrorists.

The administrative complex and stores that were targeted Sunday are ahead of the main complex of the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters. The site is 70 to 80 metres from the office of the brigade’s commander and barely 1 km from the nearest civilian settlement. The complex has a three-tier security cover from the Army, the BSF and police.

Sources said the terrorists could have sneaked through the LoC during the night before carrying out the attack in the early hours. Since the camp is heavily fortified, officials said the terrorists couldn’t have come in from the main town from Hajipeer on the LoC, where they could have been intercepted as the Army has a strong presence there.
The site of the attack is 14 km from the main Uri-Kaman post that is used by the Peace Bus (Caravan-e-Aman) and officials said it is possible that the terrorists used that route to reach the camp.

Another possibility, officials said, is that the terrorists sneaked through a village called Sukhdar that is 4 kilometres south of the site of the attack. They said this is the shortest route to reach the camp after infiltrating the LoC. Though it is heavily guarded, the sources did not rule out the possibility that the fidayeen risked it.
A third possibility is that the terrorists came through from the southwest, crossed the river Jhelum and travelled via Salamabad towards the Brigade headquarters. However, many BSF and Army camps are located on the way.

Among the various other routes infiltrators have used in the past, some have been via Maiyan and Pattan village north of Uri, Pattan from the west, and Gawhalan Singtung and Silikote from the south.

Vicky Kaushal-starrer Uri: The Surgical Strike will be released in Maharashtra once again on July 26, commemorated as Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Directed by Aditya Dhar, the film is based on the 2016 Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan as a retaliation for the Uri attack in Kashmir that claimed the lives of 17 Army personnel.
“I am deeply honoured that ‘Uri…’ is becoming a part of the Kargil Vijay Diwas celebrations on 26th July. It’s a wonderful initiative by our honourable Chief Minister Devendra Fadanavis sir to showcase the film in 500 locations across Maharashtra.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I truly hope ‘Uri…’ keeps motivating each and every Indian for generations to join hands in serving our nation to the best of their ability,” Aditya said.
The director said the team is hoping the film will inspire people to join armed forces.
“… We are flooded with so many messages, calls and e-mails from young Indians who were inspired by the film and decided to joined our armed forces.
“It’s truly the greatest validation for any filmmaker to know that somewhere their work has got the youth of India to think about the bravery, valour and sacrifice of our brave soldiers and instill these very emotions in them,” he added.
The film, produced by Ronnie Screwvala, released on January 11 and went on to earn Rs 342 crore worldwide at the box office.
The trio – Vicky, Aditya and Screwvala are teaming up for their next, titled Ashwatthama."

Thirteen years after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire that was meant to prepare the ground for peace in Jammu and Kashmir, both countries are locked in savage skirmishes that threaten to unleash a fresh storm over the Himalayas. The tragic killing of 11 bus passengers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on Wednesday, preceded by savage attacks on Indian troops and counter-attacks across the Line of Control (LoC), could set the stage for a resumption of the great duels which raged from 1989 to 2003. Hundreds of civilian and military lives were lost for no military end during that period. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon be confronted with two difficult choices. He could, first, tamp down the crisis by seeking to raise the costs for Pakistan army to levels which would threaten its standing among Pakistan’s population as the state’s praetorian guard — potentially by seizing small bits of territory along the LoC, as some Indian generals advocated after Kargil, or hitting terror positions deep inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Such actions, however, pose the risk of escalating into war, and undoing the prime minister’s economic objectives. The second option is to give diplomacy another chance to resolve the crisis. But if it fails, the prime minister could find India more vulnerable than before to terrorist attacks, and his own core constituency alienated.
For an understanding of the choices, one most turn to New Delhi’s decision-making — one of reflex, more than reflection — after the Uri attack in September. Following his election, Prime Minister Modi had reached out to his counterpart, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in a bid to normalise India-Pakistan relations. That effort, however, was challenged by Pakistan’s generals, using their time-trusted allies, jihadist terrorists. The generals thought the Indian prime minister would not order a retaliatory strike for fear of sparking off a war. India’s cross-LoC strikes in September were intended to challenge that assumption.
The experience of the years between 1989 to 2003 shows both the armies can indefinitely sustain this low-grade violence. The skirmishes, Pakistan’s generals know, hurt India more than Pakistan: Under fire, it is that much harder for India’s counter-infiltration troops to guard against jihadists crossing the LoC. This summer, jihadist groups will be that much better positioned to capitalise on the growing influence of anti-India political forces in Kashmir’s countryside. The cross-border attacks in September were hailed as a new direction for India’s Pakistan policy — but bar some careful thinking, it could easily lead to a bloody cul-de-sac."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said there was anger in the nation following the terrorist attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir which left 18 jawans dead. “Those responsible for Uri attack will not go unpunished,” Prime Minister Modi said, adding that he had huge respect for the Indian Army and had full faith in them. “Peace, unity and harmony are the ways to resolve problems and move towards development,” Modi said in a message to Kashmiris.
Prime Minister Modi also praised Indian athletes at the Rio 2016 Paralympics for bringing glory to the nation. In his address, Modi also spoke about the government’s efforts in sanitation and waste management, urging people to focus on building toilets and keeping the nation clean. As the nation celebrates Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, Modi urged Indians to conduct cleaning drives and requested them to send in their pictures and videos to him, through his App.

He was addressing the nation in his monthly radio address."

The decision to send the teams was taken in view of the high number of casualties in the worst terror strike in the state since the Uri attack in 2016.

Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday condemned Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad for comparing the demonetisation of higher currency notes with Pakistan terror attacks. “Leader of Opposition is insulting the nation by making such remarks by comparing this with the Pakistan terror attacks and he should apologise,” said Naidu in the Rajya Sabha.

Azad said,“Pakistan terrorists did not kill even half of our people in Uri than those who have died due to government’s wrong policy. Till the PM comes to the house for discussion we will not let the house function.”
Outside Parliament, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked the Centre to rollback the decision in three days or face intensified protest.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If this decision (demonetisation) is not taken back in three days, we will intensify our protest. Today, they announced that only Rs. 2,000 can be exchanged and not Rs. 4,000. What’s going in their head? If the people are suffering, who would protect the Constitution? So I approached President Pranab Mukherjee. If vegetable mandi is shut, what will people eat–diamond or ATM card?” Mamata said while addressing a rally of traders, farmers and labourers at the Azadpur Mandi here.

Saying demonetisation will push the country backwards by 100 years, Mamata said the crisis of this proportion was not seen even during the Emergency of 1975. She also submitted a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee and sought his intervention on the issue.
Both Houses of parliament were adjourned till Friday following uproar over the issue of demonetisation issue."

Pakistan has become a hub of terrorism and is resorting to subversive activities as it cannot win an open war with India, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday.
His remark comes a day after terrorists suspected to be from Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammaed stormed an army base in Kashmir’s Uri, killing 18 soldiers and injuring 19 others.
“Pakistan has become a big center of terrorism and is resorting to subversive activities as it cannot win an open war with India,” he said on the sidelines of a programme in Guwahati.

“We want both the countries to go forward on the path of development peacefully,” Javadekar said."

(Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri)
Why is Pakistan denying India’s surgical strikes?
Jammu and Kashmir continues to be the core dispute between the two countries and we strongly believe that these… can only be resolved through serious and sustained diplomacy. From UN resolutions to our joint statement, which our two countries have issued in Islamabad on December 10 last year. Jammu and Kashmir remains the core issue, and both countries recognise that this dispute needs to be resolved, and I think you may also appreciate that both our countries have fought three wars because of this dispute, in 1948, 1965, 71 and the Kargil conflict, and all these wars/ conflicts preceded the Samjhauta Express blast, the Mumbai attack, and so on and so forth. So, from our viewpoint both countries must bring diplomacy to centrestage. Now, coming to your question, I think three things have happened. You ask me as to why Pakistan is denying… Firstly, this is for the first time that India has publicly acknowledged to have breached the 2003 ceasefire understanding, so this is quite significant. Secondly, what I see is the commonly acceptable definition of surgical strike has been modulated unilaterally by India… which also means cross-LoC firing… Why I am saying this… the official statement issued by India, your DGMO, very clearly suggests that the action took place along the Line of Control, not across… Now, as far as Pakistan is concerned, we haven’t seen any activity on September 29, other than usual cross-LoC firing… and you know what our stance is, we have also taken both Pakistani and foreign journalists to the locations… There is no sign of any activity in those areas, other than the cross-LoC firing in which two Pakistani soldiers have been martyred.
WATCH VIDEO: Abdul Basit Interview Excerpts: War Is Not Really A Solution To Our Problemshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Denying the strikes, experts say, is a smart move by Pakistan so that the situation is not allowed to escalate…
I don’t think so, because I can assure you that, God forbid, if any action takes place, that will be retaliated immediately…We are confident that our deterrence is working… It is important to avoid drawing wrong conclusions and raising false expectations, because it is not in our mutual interest to push ourselves to the precipice…
Last night’s Baramulla strike…was that part of retaliation?
Not at all…[A] surgical strike… did not take place at all. So Baramulla, or before that Uri, and before that so many other things happening in Kashmir clearly tell us that the J&K dispute needs to be resolved, cannot be brushed under the carpet… in accordance with the aspirations of people of J&K… That continues to be our position.
WATCH VIDEO: PM Modi To Push For Masood Azhar’s Ban With Chinese President Jinping During BRICS Summit
 
How do you explain the attacks in Uri and Baramulla?
It is for your government to tell this… not for me to jump the gun… But what bothers us is whenever attacks occur in India, immediately fingers are pointed at Pakistan. We saw that post-Uri, followed during the attack and we are seeing in Baramulla, so my sincere advice to Indian friends and people that this is very very unhelpful. You know the problems in J&K, you know what is happening since July 8.
Are you linking the attacks to the protests in Kashmir?
No, I am not saying anything, because it is for you to determine, for you to find out what your investigations tell you. And since you haven’t shared your findings with us, as to what happened, indeed happened there, so it is not for me to comment on the Uri attack.
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in his UNGA speech, referred to Burhan Wani knowing very well how it would be received in India. Do you think it derailed almost a decade of work?
I don’t think so. If hundreds and thousands of people come out on the streets to attend Burhan Wani’s funeral… It is important not to be in denial mode. What is happening clearly shows as to what exactly people of J&K are thinking, what do they want. So as I said earlier, both our countries need to give diplomacy centre-stage and rather than talking at each other, it is important to talk to each other and that appears the best possible way forward.
So, what are the three things that you think will take it forward?
It is not a matter of one or two or three things, frankly speaking. We need to have, I said earlier, serious and sustained diplomacy. And result-oriented engagement. And I can tell you that in Pakistan, we do not see dialogue as a favour by one country to another country, dialogue is in our mutual interest. If India is ready, Pakistan will be willing, if India is not ready then we can always wait for India to make up its mind. At the end of the day, I would say both our countries need to work for peace and prosperity, as the Indian PM very rightly said in his address in Kerala, we need to fight against poverty. If we were to fight against poverty, I think we need to work together.

How do you justify statements by your own defence minister when he threatens the use of nuclear weapons?
Such statements we have seen here in India also. Both our countries understand war is not really a solution to our problems

and there is simply no room for a conflict in a nuclear environment… It is important to avoid raising false expectations, as happened after the cross-LoC firing [which India calls a surgical strike] on September 29. We cannot afford to go down that route. Statements are made, but I think both countries do understand serious implications of escalating the situation either horizontally or vertically.
Would the return of the Indian soldier in Pakistan’s custody be helpful?
I do not know if we have made any arrest… I think this was raised by your DGMO with our DGMO this morning, but so far at least I do not know if a soldier has been arrested by Pakistan.
Are you saying that he’s not in your custody?
Not to my knowledge.

Post-Pathankot, there was much more cooperation seen from both sides at the highest level… There was unprecedented access to your investigators to the Indian Air Force base, but post-Uri, it is denial, even to the extent of saying it is a false flag operation. Why is this?
Because, if you immediately start saying that Pakistan is a terrorist state, or done by Pakistan, you do not leave any room for cooperation, so that’s why I said it is important for our two countries, and especially, you know when anything happens in India, Pakistan is immediately blamed for it. So obviously, while the attack was under way, you started airing accusations from the Indian side, which was very unfortunate. If you vitiate the atmosphere right at the outset, obviously you do not leave any room for subsequent cooperation.
India believes Pakistan did not respond adequately enough even after India allowed them to the Pathankot base… Earlier, Mr Modi travelled to Lahore.
Optics are important, especially in Pakistan and India context, but you cannot rest your entire engagement on optics, optics should lead to substance… Our PM came here to attend [Modi’s] oath-taking ceremony, all these were optics, useful optics I would say. Those optics did help to break the ice, provided us space to move forward, but then unfortunately in the last two-and-a-half years, we haven’t been able to engage in a substantive dialogue process.
Is the back channel functioning, are the NSAs talking again?
I am not aware of such contacts… no, there is no back-channel.
Has Pakistan discussed the escalation with China?
We are in touch with all major powers, key countries, through diplomatic channels, I would not rule out our engagement, contacts, with other countries… to brief them about what is happening on the ground.

There is disappointment here, especially on the veto of Masood Azhar. How does it help in a situation like this?
We need to move beyond the usual whining and whinging. Masood Azhar, if there is any solid evidence against him, he would have been on the list by now. I think China is always very correct on these matters, so I do not see any problem. If India does have any evidence then they should share [it] with us and China. Things can be taken forward, but simply on the basis of allegations, you cannot achieve results.
Do you share the pessimism on both sides about the relationship?

No, I can never be pessimistic, as a diplomat I am always optimistic about things. From our perspective, J&K remains the core dispute, I am not suggesting that other issues are not important, we have arrested as you know Kulbhushan Yadav. We have serious concerns and we would like these issues also be addressed, I am sure if we gave diplomacy a chance, things can be taken care of.
Have you reached out to political parties here in the current situation?
I am in touch with politicians of all hues.
Post surgical strikes?
I have been in touch with… that is my job.
From the BJP?
All, of all…
What is the initial response?
You know, politicians, whether they are [of] Pakistan or India, they all want a good relationship… Pakistan policy should not be driven by domestic political compulsion. When that happens, you see too many ups and downs, so we need also to get out of this.

The SAARC summit stands postponed. It wasn’t just India, four more countries joined the boycott. Do you see this as an unprecedented isolation of Pakistan?
First of all, this is not the first time a SAARC summit has been postponed, I can give you many examples… You know Pakistan is

too big a country to be isolated, so we are not worried about that, and I am sure good sense will prevail and [we] will host the 19th SAARC summit at an appropriate time. So we are also positive that it has been postponed, but Pakistan will be able to host it… if not this year, hopefully next year.
Pakistan loses out more because India is already engaging with other neighbours…
We also engage with number of countries through different channels…We also engage with ASEAN, we have China… Pakistan’s strategic location is such that one likes it or not, Pakistan is destined to become a regional economic hub in times to come. We are the natural bridge between Central and South Asia. Now with CPEC, Pakistan will automatically become the centre of economic activity.
Do you feel that the situation could slide further? If these attacks were to continue…
I do not know but there are huge stakes involved for both Pakistan and India, and there is no reason for us to be thinking along these terms. We should be positive… we need to have serious and sustained diplomacy. If that is allowed to happen then perhaps things may improve, but the problem is still there, the J&K problem is still there, as I said, that needs to be resolved… I do not know how long you can deny that, deny this right to the people of J&K.
So, what can Pakistan do at this time in reaching out to India?
Reaching out, I am sitting here.
When you mention serious sustained diplomacy, what is the first step?
First step is to talk to each other, break the ice.
And you think that needs to be done immediately?
Let’s hope, how it is done I do not know, let us not discuss it now, in my view. We will find a way out, how to go about it.

Are there any any plans for you to set up a call between the two principals, the two prime ministers, the NSAs?
It has to be done step by step, it is an incremental process, let’s see how we get out.
Why doesn’t Pakistan accord MFN [most favoured nation] status to India?
Whenever we have talks in place, that will be one of the areas that will be discussed because Pakistan would like to have a level playing field. There are issues… the balance of trade continues to be in your favour… Pakistan is not averse to giving that status to India, but that has to be done rationally and fairly so that Pakistan’s economic interests are not hurt.
Prime Minister Modi, in his Kozhikode speech, said India exports software and Pakistan exports terror, and that people of Pakistan should seek answers from their leadership. What do you think?
It won’t be appropriate for me to comment on what Prime Minister Modi sahab said. But I can tell you Pakistan has one of the leading software export industries, our software exports are increasing by the day and we are very proud of the youth of Pakistan… We do have problems… but most of our problems stem from our regional environment… the rest of the world, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, left Pakistan high and dry to do the heavy lifting, left Pakistan to fight the terrible legacy of the long conflict in Afghanistan… In 9/11, not a single Pakistani was involved in that horrendous terror act, yet Pakistan faced the brunt… We have lost close to 70,000 of our people, including more than 5,000 security personnel, in the war against terrorism… Pakistan is on its way to eliminate this scourge. And we are confident we will succeed.
Has this been the most testing time of your 30 months here?
These are difficult times… But I am always hopeful. There is no room for the two countries to keep in this phase indefinitely, they will have to come out of this. Then the question will be how do we ensure we are on a trajectory which will take us forward, and that will be a challenge — for diplomats, for politicians, for the leadership, on both sides of the border."

(File)
The Pakistan Supreme Court Saturday reinstated the ban on the broadcast of Indian content on television channels in the country, setting aside a July judgement by the Lahore High Court (LHC) which lifted the ban imposed by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), Dawn reported. The decision will reinstate the ban on the broadcasting of Indian teleplays or television dramas.
According to Dawn, the case filed by the United Producers Association was heard by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar, who said, “They are trying to [obstruct the construction] of our dam and we cannot even ban their channels?” Along with banning the Indian content on Pakistani television, the chief justice added, “the authorities should only air appropriate content.”
The ban was first implemented by PEMRA in 2016 after it received clearance from the Pakistani government. The decision was a fallout of relations between the two countries after the Uri attack. According to the decision, the news and entertainment TV channels, FM radio stations and the channels operated by the cable operators were allowed to air a maximum of 10 per cent foreign content in 24 hours, with the limit for Indian content of an hour and 40 minutes, excluding advertisements and breaks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While the ban was lifted in February this year, the permission to air teleplays or television dramas was still not granted. Following the ban, M/s Leo Communications, TV channel Filmazia’s parent organisation, sought to overturn it challenging that the PEMRA circular was beyond the powers of the regulatory body and the Constitution, and claimed that the government was indulging in “selective patriotism” because even though Indian movies were allowed to be screened all over the country, they could not be aired on television, Dawn reported.
LHC Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah had stated that Indian content with objectionable or anti-Pakistan content could be censored but there was no need for a complete ban. “The world has become a global village,” Justice Shah remarked, asking how long unreasonable restrictions would be imposed. It is to be noted that the two countries have long cultural relations with artists, cine stars from Pakistan working in India, while Indian film stars have also performed in Pakistan over the years."

Since 2014, when the last SAARC summit was held in Kathmandu, India had made it more than clear that it no longer considers the South Asia grouping viable. It was Islamabad’s turn to host the next summit in 2016, but the Uri attack intervened, and India refused to attend. Under the SAARC charter, the summit cannot be held even if a single nation stays away, and the grouping has remained in limbo since.
In the last five years, India has actively sought to isolate Pakistan in the region, and hyped up its engagement with other regional groupings such as BBIN (Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal), and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), which includes Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan.
“SAARC has certain problems and I think we all know what it is, even if you were to put the terrorism issue aside, there are connectivity and trade issues. If you look at why BIMSTEC leaders were invited for PM’s swearing-in, because we see energy, mindset and possibility in BIMSTEC,” S Jaishankar said, immediately after taking charge as External Affairs Minister.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At a meeting of SAARC foreign ministers in New York, seven weeks after India had stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and statehood, Jaishankar said: “In our view, elimination of terrorism in all its forms is a pre-condition not only for fruitful cooperation but also for the very survival of the region itself.” The Pakistan Foreign Minister had declared he would not attend the lunch meeting as he could not sit with the “killers of Kashmiris”.
So, how should we read the sudden resurrection of SAARC by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with the stated aim of working out a regional approach to the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping through all the countries of the region? Does it mean anything for the future of the regional grouping?
Opinion | Covid-19 nudges India to pursue regional cooperation through both SAARC and BIMSTEC
Despite hopes that this might be a SAARC revival, officials have discounted such speculation. That would require India to climb down from its position that Pakistan has taken verifiable steps to address India’s concerns on terrorism. There is no evidence at all that Delhi is about to do that. Or, it would need Pakistan to turn over a new leaf, stop playing with free radicals to use against India, in Kashmir or elsewhere, when the time is ripe. Neither is about to happen.
Still, at a time when leaders across the globe appeared to be engrossed in the COVID-19 calamity of their own nations, Modi was the first to think of calling the neighbours. Full marks. Almost all South Asian countries are bound to each other by land borders and frequent inter-travel, and it is important that the region liaises to stop the disease from spreading across the Subcontinent.
It was a trifle disappointing, therefore, that beyond the experience of witnessing a unique video summit, that was beamed live into homes in every country in the region, since the meeting, there is not much to suggest that a cooperative response is in the works, with the urgency that is required for the swiftness with which the disease is spreading. There is no evidence that each country is willing to learn from the other’s experiences, or public health systems, or that we are tracking each other’s data and responses.
Two proposals were made: One by India for a regional fund that Modi has generously offered to put aside $10 million for. Pakistan proposed the setting up of a diseases surveillance centre for sharing real time data. India has said it would prepare emergency response task forces to help out the member countries in need. Delhi is said to be in the process of sending medical supplies worth $1 million to Nepal, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, which sounds like a fraction of what they may eventually require. Pakistan has said China will give it testing kits, protective gear and portable ventilators, as well as a cash grant for a state-of-the-art isolation centre. Beijing, eager to live down its image as the point of origin for this global mayhem, will make the same offer to other South Asian countries soon.
If the intention was to try and restore the aura Prime Minister Modi enjoyed in the region at the beginning of NDA-1, as some have not improbably suggested, it has to go beyond this Big Boss event. SAARC leaders have been used to Modi’s out-of-the-box ideas from the time they were all invited to his 2014 swearing-in ceremony, and also to these not leading anywhere in particular. The video summit saw polite attendance by all SAARC leaders, with the exception of Pakistan which sent its health minister, who predictably raised the issue of Kashmir. But going by the scant media coverage that the summit, the first after six years, received in the neighbourhood, no one is holding their breath.
For many countries in the region now, India has lost the heft it used to have in the last century. A proximate reason is because it is no longer an economic powerhouse nor holds the promise of being one in the near future. The other reason is that it no longer offers itself as a model nation, pulling together its complex diversities, pluralism and political ideologies in a broad-minded vision. The real damage to India’s standing was, of course, done by the badmouthing of the Muslim countries in the neighbourhood to justify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. Seen from the eyes of other countries in South Asia today, India is now just a larger version of themselves and their political and economic dysfunctions, while additionally possessing and wielding the instruments to be vengeful and punitive in its foreign policy — including arm-twisting them now and then in its constant quest to isolate Pakistan.
The real test of Modi’s leadership of South Asia, and by extension of India’s, will come after the pandemic subsides, when each country has to deal with what remains of its economy. The tourism economy of Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka would have been crushed by then. Pakistan will be worse off than it is now. There will be more unemployment and hardship everywhere in the region.
Some of these countries will inevitably turn to China. If Modi’s gesture is to go some way as part of the solution for the region, India, which will be picking up the pieces itself, must have something to offer to its South Asian neighbours six months to a year down the line. Is there such a plan? Can India put aside the prejudices of its domestic communalism, and its own economic woes, demonstrate large-heartedness to all the countries of the region, irrespective of what religion its people follow, irrespective of its historical hostilities with at least one? There may be more economic refugees knocking on India’s doors, apart from a host of other inter-regional problems.
Can India be the generous big-hearted leader that SAARC may need in the post-COVID-19 world, or will the hunt for “termites” keep the vision narrow, the party line strong, and the leadership unfulfilled?

In a fresh anti-India tirade, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has alleged that the assault on an Indian army base in Uri that killed 18 soldiers was a “plan devised by India itself”.
Maintaining that no proof implicating Pakistan in the Uri attack had surfaced yet, Asif told DawnNews that “it was evident the attack was a plan devised by India itself.” India has said it has evidence showing involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the Uri attack and demanded that Islamabad refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism directed against this country.
One of the four terrorists involved in the Uri attack has been identified as Hafiz from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Pakistani minister claimed that the “entire world knows now that India is not as serious about resolving the Kashmir dispute as Pakistan is”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

He claimed India has not received support from anywhere despite launching a diatribe against Pakistan and added that China had, on the other hand, supported Pakistan’s viewpoint. Commenting on a bill moved in the US Congress to label Pakistan as a terrorist state, he said that anti-Pakistan elements are present in each and every country but the impacts of their voices depend on the policies of these countries.

“As a result we have moved upwards in almost all the global indices that measure such performance and transformed our country into one of the most open economies in the world,” Modi told the BRICS Business Council. He indicated that the (economic) growth of the country was going strong and the government was taking steps to keep the momentum going.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi added that the BRICS Business Council Business Council was vital in linking trade, business opportunities, investments, innovation and doing away with bottlenecks among member nations. Applauding the Council for living up to its expectation of expanding trade and business, Modi credited the business council members for enhancing the ease of doing business, dismantling trade barriers, promoting skills development, establishing manufacturing supply chains and infrastructure development.
With reference to the performance of the New Development Bank (NDB) he congratulated the management for commencing the first batch of projects. “NDB is fully operational now. We welcome the bank’s priority for (funding) clean energy and sustainable infrastructure,” he said.

The comments made by Israeli Ambassador to India Daniel Carmon assume significance in the wake of last Sunday’s terror attack in Uri, where the terrorists were believed to have come from Pakistan crossing the Line of Control.
The top Israeli diplomat said his country is following the development with concern and affirmed that cooperation on terrorism shall be a permanent feature of bilateral ties.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Carmon said Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, during his last visit to Israel, was shown the country’s preparedness level at the borders.
“Our message is, yes, Israel has the expertise, because it has been under threat. We do share similar challenges. We have the solutions. We can work together on the solution.
“We have shown in other areas that we can cooperate and this might and should be the case here as well,” Carmon said during a media briefing on the upcoming HLS and Cyber Conference in Tel Aviv.
Asked about the Uri attacks, which claimed the lives of 18 soldiers, Carmon said Israel’s cooperation with India on a daily basis on anti-terrorism, defence and homeland security “is there, was there and will continue to be there”.
“There is a need to confront terrorism. There is a tactical way to do this. There is an international, diplomatic way to do this and I am sure and confident that India knows exactly what it needs to do,” he said.
Carmon said that Israel was willing to share conceptual and technological knowledge on how it was countering cyber threats, which he said can emanate from anywhere and not any particular country.
The conference will be held between November 14-17 where a number of Indian companies are expected to participate."

“I would like to offer my sincerest apologies to anyone that I may have offended with my tweets on Friday evening and especially people from India,” he said in a video apology. “This was never my intention and the language was unacceptable. I feel that I have let a lot of people down, my family, my friends and my former colleagues. This I very sincerely apologise for,” he said.
“On Friday evening I saw, on the news, children being pulled out of rubble, people being pelted with pellets, women mourning their dead in Kashmir. This upset me very deeply and in a moment of madness I ranted out. I vented my anger,” he claimed. “Again, the language that I used, I sincerely apologise for.

‘Sunday Mirror’ had published screenshots of messages posted on Anwar’s private Twitter account which appeared to hit out at India over Kashmir and referred to Indian people as “bastards” and “piss-drinking cunts”. Speaking to BBC on Monday, Anwar said his Twitter account was private at the time the tweets were posted and he had not expected them to be widely read.
“My Twitter account was private because I didn’t want to engage with anybody… I’m not a bigot, not a coward and not a liar. I’m definitely not a racist,” he told BBC. ITV channel had issued a statement after being alerted to the messages by the newspaper: “We are deeply shocked by the entirely unacceptable, racially offensive comments made on Twitter by Marc Anwar. We have talked to Marc and, as a consequence of his comments, he will not be returning to ‘Coronation Street’ with immediate effect”.
The channel is expected to try and minimise the actor’s presence in the show until his character can be eventually written out. His remarks came days after the Uri attack which led to the killing of 17 Indian Army jawans."

China on Monday successfully launched a spacecraft carrying two astronauts, in its longest-ever manned space mission, who would later join its experimental space lab orbiting the Earth as the country moved a step closer to establish its permanent space station by 2022.

Chinese astronauts Jing Haipeng, 50, and Chen Dong, 37, were blasted off into space by Shenzhou-11 (heavenly vessel) spacecraft at 7:30 am local time (5 am IST) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre near the Gobi Desert in northwest China.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Shenzhou-11 was put into orbit by a Long March-2F carrier rocket after the launch, telecast live by the state-run China Central Television (CCTV).
The spacecraft will dock with orbiting space lab Tiangong-2 in two days and the astronauts will stay in the lab for 30 days, Wu Ping, Deputy Director of China’s manned space engineering office said.
While Jing is on his third spaceflight, this is Chen’s first space mission, which is the longest stay so far by Chinese astronauts, during which they will conduct tests on spacecraft-related technologies and scientific and engineering experiments.
The mission was declared a success by Zhang Youxia, commander-in-chief of China’s manned space programme, about 19 minutes after the blast-off, state-run Xinhua reported.
President Xi Jinping, who is currently in Goa to attend the BRICS Summit, congratulated everyone engaged in the mission for the successful launch, saying it is a milestone in China’s space programme.
The mission of the orbiting space lab Tiangong-2 and the Shenzhou-11 manned spacecraft marks the first time that Chinese astronauts will stay in orbit for medium term, Xi, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said.
In his message, he encouraged staff of the mission to “constantly break new ground for the manned space programme, so that Chinese people will take bigger steps and march further in space probe, to make new contribution to the building of China into a space power”.
Premier Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan, both members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, watched the live broadcast of the launch at the command centre of China’s manned space programme in Beijing.
The space lab was launched last month as part of China’s efforts to set up its own manned space station by 2022, which will make it the only the country to have such a facility in service as the current in-service International Space Station (ISS) retires by 2024.
China is putting billions of dollars into its space programme in a bid to catch up with the US and Europe. It also plans to launch its maiden Mars mission in 2020 to match India and others.
Hours before the lift-off, the two astronauts appeared in good spirits and answered several questions.
“Although the job is challenging, risky and dangerous, there is nothing more I would rather do,” Jing, commander of this mission, said yesterday.
It will be Jing’s third spaceflight following his Shenzhou-7 mission in September 2008 and Shenzhou-9 mission in March 2012.
“(For this mission) we have improved our ability to deal with emergencies, first aid and space experiments,” Jing told reporters.
Chen, on his maiden space mission, said: “I will treasure every moment in space and ensure record my experience in my diary and enjoy the out-of-this-world scenery.”
China, which conducted its first manned space mission in 2003, has said its space programme is for peaceful purposes, but it has also tested anti-satellite missiles in addition to its civilian aims.
The Shenzhou-11 spaceship will return to Earth within a day after docking the two astronauts on Tiangong-2 space lab and separating from it, Wu said.
With a safe flight record of 1,500 hours as an air force pilot, Chen became China’s second group of astronauts in May 2010, and was selected as a crew member of the Shenzhou-11 mission in June 2016, Wu said.
Other objectives of the manned space mission include aerospace medical experiments, space science experiments and in-orbit maintenance with human participation, as well as other activities, Wu said.
The two astronauts will undertake ultrasound tests during space travel for the first time, cultivate plants in space, and test the three winners of an experiment design competition run in Hong Kong for secondary school students.
Several technical alterations have been made to Shenzhou- 11, though its main functions and technical parameters are basically the same as Shenzhou-10, Wu said.
Lei Fanpei, chairman of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), recently said China plans to launch the experimental core module of its space station around 2018 with a Long March-5 heavy load carrier rocket, and the 20 ton combination space station will be sent into orbit around 2022.
The space station has a designed life of 10 years in orbit 400 kms above the earth surface. With this space station, China will become the second country after Russia to have developed a space station.
China made a three-step strategy in 1992 for its manned space programme, the large-scale manned space station being the last step."

In light of the recent terrorist attack on an Indian Army encampment in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri town that killed 17 jawans, all eyes are trained on what the government will do next. Public sentiment is sharp and there is huge pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give perpetrators of the attack a befitting reply. Interestingly, the influential Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) has maintained a hyper-aggressive stance on such attacks emanating from Pakistan. After senior RSS functionary and BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav insisted that the way forward is “for one tooth, the complete jaw”, it remains to be seen whether the Sangh’s position will have a bearing on the way India’s retaliation is oriented.
Speaking on the Uri terror attack on Sunday, Ram Madhav said: “The Prime Minister has promised that those behind the Uri terror attack will not go unpunished. That should be the way forward. For one tooth, the complete jaw.” Prior to joining the BJP in his official capacity, Madhav served as spokesperson for the RSS and was a prominent member of its national executive.
Madhav said “the days of so-called strategic restraint are over” adding that “if terrorism is the instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Concurrently, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, second-in-command after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, gave a call for firm and conclusive action. “The terrorists, their masters and supporters should be dealt with firmly and conclusively.”
It is clear that the NDA government has a significant backing and influence of the RSS. Given the possibility that the RSS ideology and stance may shadow, or still is, the government’s Pakistan policy, PM Modi’s next move will be dissected and scrutinised in every manner possible. For years, Pakistan has perpetrated terror attacks on India. Its Inter Services Intelligence, GHQ of the Pakistani military and sponsored terror outfits have been actively targeting India exploiting our defensive standpoint and have time and again tried to make Kashmir a flashpoint.
Indian policymakers by and large have maintained a sagacious position of handling Pakistani terrorism in India and the role played by elements like JeM, LeT, Syed Salahuddin and others in escalating the tension between the two countries on the battlefront. The 26/11 attacks, Pathankot siege, Uri attack and a host of other terrorist and fidayeen attacks on Indian security forces have led to popular sentiment being aligned with the RSS view.

After the Pathankot terror attack in this January, the RSS, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Organiser, had said: “Non-state actors operate within boundaries of state with overt or covert support of some elements within. Therefore, national governments have to make a firm resolve to defeat them, without that no composite dialogue can take place. Resultantly, non-state actors become state themselves, as happened in case of the IS. Hope Pakistan does not move in the same direction.”
It had also held that the issue needs to be handled beyond blaming and cornering of governments. “Neither mere blaming Pakistan as perpetrator of cross-border terrorism nor cornering government for the sake of opposition will yield any results.”
Pakistan, which only appears to be intent on speaking about Kashmir’s sovereignty and not the Pak-supported terror activities in the region, has fuelled the divide in the state and promoted religious extremism and violence apart from civilian unrest. The BJP, which is the political offshoot of the Sangh, has tried to act amicably with the Pakistani government during its current tenure. However, several Sangh leaders echoed the view in in December 2015 that Pakistan is desperate to spread violence in Kashmir and that the international community, whose sympathy is sought by Pakistan after every attack, should be wary of their tactics.
India’s Pakistan policy is a complex issue and attacks on India’s sovereignty put the government in a more vexed situation. War with an unstable Pakistan, with an uncontrolled military and ISI, is a prospect that successive governments in the past decade and half have rightly stood off. However, the stance of absorbing continued offensives on a no-first-strike policy has done little to help India’s case. RSS has, apart from rare situations when PM Modi and in the past former PM Atal Bihar Vajpayee reaching out to Pakistan for dialogue, has maintained that negotiations or discussions on Kashmir are not an option and a soft stance makes India vulnerable to more attacks.
The government has a host of options to react further. It can urge Islamabad to take action on terrorists in Pakistan, or appeal sanctions on Pakistan from the international community, or resort to a cold start doctrine to neutralise terror heads in Pakistan with surgical strikes. It may even let the situation subside or resort to diplomatic dialogue as a measure to avoid a military or possibly a nuclear standoff with Pakistan. The Pathankot attacks resulted in increased militarisation of battle positions on the LoC and the tensions took so degree of effort to fizzle out. Madhav’s and Bhaiyaji Joshi’s views apparently resonate with the larger Sangh community to act without complacency. Madhav’s view of “For one tooth, the complete jaw” which looks to echo with the other RSS ideologues needs to be carefully handled by the government in times when popular sentiment endorses military action on India’s western neighbour."

On August 15, the Army killed five suspected terrorists trying to infiltrate the Line of Control in Uri and said they had been planning a terror strike. Infiltration attempts by armed men had been falling steadily for several years before rising sharply this year. As the security setup is focused on the ongoing unrest in Kashmir, a number of militants have crossed over.

According to the figures tabled by MoS (Home) Hansraj Ahir in the Rajya Sabha, there were 90 such attempts in the first six months of 2016, of which 54 were successful. And since July 15, the Army has foiled at least such 14 attempts. In comparison, there were 121 infiltration attempts in 2015, 31 of them successful.

A top police officer said the 14 attempts recently foiled does not present the complete picture. “These are just the numbers of infiltration attempts that were foiled. We don’t have figures on successful attempts since July. The protests have caused a breakdown of our information network,” he said.

Another senior police officer dealing with counterinsurgency operations said the Multi-Agency Centre of the Army, police, paramilitary and intelligence agencies has not met since protests began in Kashmir.
On Saturday, BSF inspector general Vikash Chandra told reporters in Srinagar that “as many as 25 to 30 militants have managed to sneak into the valley in the past over two months”. But a police officer said, “Our inputs from the ground indicate a far higher number. It can be corroborated only after the protests stop.
‘In fact, in the past two months the Army made only two attempts to cordon off villages after inputs about the presence of the militants, but had to wind up the operations after people took to the streets.
In Noorpora village of Tral in south Kashmir, the Army had to lift the cordon after protests began and the militants escaped. People also took to the streets at Fatehgarh in Baramulla, forcing the police and Army to retreat.

(File)
India and Pakistan have submitted themselves to the World Bank for the second time in two months, to help resolve a dispute over their respective interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty, signalling a softening of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tough line on Pakistan. The presence of Deepak Mittal, joint secretary in charge of the Pakistan desk in the Ministry of External Affairs, in the delegation led by Water Resources Secretary Amarjit Singh is significant. The World Bank-brokered water talks with Pakistan are taking place over Thursday and Friday, in Washington DC. Since the Pathankot and Uri attacks last year, Delhi has discouraged any kind of dialogue unless cross-border terrorism comes to an end. Reacting to India’s participation in the talks, Bimal Patel, member of the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) and Law Commission, told The Indian Express that he “doesn’t know what the government’s intention is, but it is uncalled for to participate in such meetings to perpetuate a third party role”.
Patel said he was speaking in his personal capacity. The five-member NSAB is led by National Security Advisor P S Raghavan. “I don’t know why we are going to the World Bank. We should not go to the World Bank. I fail to understand why they (the government) are doing this, inviting the World Bank to play a role which should not be there,” said Patel. The dispute is over the construction of two hydroelectric plants on the Kishenganga (330 MW) and Ratle (850 MW) tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab respectively. Pakistan complained that India was violating the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, signed under the aegis of the World Bank, because it was given unrestricted use of the waters of the two “Western Rivers” in the Indus system under the treaty.
But the treaty also allows other “uses”, including the construction of hydro-electric plants. India has taken this to mean that it can not only construct the Kishenganga and Ratle dams, but also several other projects, such as the 1000 MW Pakal Dul, 120 MW Miyar and 48 MW Lower Kalnai on various tributaries of the Chenab. Pakistan objected and asked the World Bank to set up a Court of Arbitration; as the upper riparian state, India was not adhering to its treaty obligations, Pakistan said. India, meanwhile, requested the World Bank to appoint a neutral expert to look into the matter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked about the Bank’s role in the India-Pakistan talks and what it expected from them, Bank spokesperson Elena Karaban told The Indian Express: “The meetings between India and Pakistan on the technical issues of the Indus Waters Treaty are taking place in Washington, DC on September 14-15. These meetings are a continuation of a discussion on how to safeguard the treaty for the benefit of the people in both countries.”
Delhi’s decision to drop its earlier objections and agree to participate in a Bank-brokered dialogue with Pakistan in August in Washington DC surprised all sides. Senior Bank officials even complimented both delegations for displaying a new spirit of “goodwill and cooperation”.
Deepak Mittal, the MEA official, was present in those talks as well. His participation in this second round is being seen by all sides as a signal that the Modi government is softening its position on Pakistan."

Known to call a spade a spade, veteran actor Rishi Kapoor has pulled up authorities for confusing filmmakers on the issue of casting Pakistani actors post the terror attack on the Uri cantonment in Jammu and Kashmir last September.
The actor said it was unfair to suddenly ban artists from Pakistan and there should be a cut-off date on such diktats for film productions to fall in line.
The Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) had banned Pakistani actors, singers and technicians from working on Indian films in the wake of Uri attacks and the volatile situation in Kashmir.

“Films are not planned in one or three days. It takes time. You can’t say that you’re going to ban a picture,” fumed Kapoor, who acted with Pakistan star Fawad Khan in his last hit “Kapoor & Sons”.
“You’ve been working for the last six months. These are unfair rulings and bullying tactics. You must give a cut-off period. It gives us time to finish our films and henceforth we will not take them.
“Sometimes some skirmish happens in the border and your whole thinking goes wrong. Sometimes you shake hands and say go ahead. You’re confusing your country, people.
“Either you shake hands or don’t shake hands. Why does Modi have to go to Pakistan and shake hands when you know skirmishes will happen,” Kapoor said picking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Pakistan in December 2015 to meet his counterpart Nawaz Sharif.

Talking about his autobiography “Khullam Khulla”, the actor, who had won a National Award for his debut role as a child artist in “Mera Naam Joker”, said it was always difficult matching the steps of Amitabh Bachchan during his heyday.

“In my book, I have always tried to put myself down and talk about my weaknesses, losses and failures. I have just been as honest as I can. There are things I don’t need to say but I have said also. It’s like a confession box statement,” said Kapoor, who is known for his blockbuster films like “Bobby”, “Amar Akbar Anthony”, “Hum Kisise Kum Naheen” and “Karz”.
“There’s a wrong notion in people’s minds that actors’ children have it very easy. We don’t have nepotism in our industry. There are so many cases where actors’ sons and daughters have failed also. It’s only about the first film where you are launched. After that, you’re on your own.
“Like (father) Raj Kapoor is not because of (grandfather) Prithviraj Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor is not because of Raj Kapoor and (son) Ranbir (Kapoor) is not because of Rishi Kapoor.”
Kapoor said his struggle started after he got stardom.
“My struggle was after I got stardom. I had to survive in an action-oriented arena.
“The whole era of films changed after the entry of Mr Bachchan in 1973. For me, it was an ordeal to battle the Angry Young Man (as Bachchan was referred to).
“I have always been struggling to match the strides of the Angry Young Man. For me, it was difficult to survive as I was only doing musicals. Others were doing action films.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met President Pranab Mukherjee to brief him on the developments related to the Uri terror attack, hours after he discussed the issue with senior ministers and top officials.
Modi went to the Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening and apprised the President of the details related to the attack on the Army camp that took place yesterday, official sources said.
The Prime Minister’s meeting with the President came hours after he chaired a meeting on the Uri attack with senior ministerial colleagues top officials.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The meeting was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, NSA Ajit Doval, Army Chief Gen Dalbir Singh, and senior officials of the ministries of Home and Defence.

Modi had yesterday asserted that “those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished."

Producer Ritesh Sidhwani has rubbished reports that the release of his forthcoming Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Raees has been pushed, saying the film will hit the screens as announced.
Raees, scheduled to release on January 26 next year, features Pakistani actress Mahira Khan who is making her Bollywood debut opposite Shah Rukh. There were reports that the makers were considering to push the release of the crime-drama, after MNS demanded a ban on Bollywood films starring Pakistani artistes, in wake of the Uri terror attack.
The Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA), however, had a meeting with MNS and urged the political party not to hamper the release of the already shot films featuring Pakistani artistes.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When asked about the reports, Sidhwani told reporters, “We are sticking to the release date we announced earlier for ‘Raees’. I don’t think something like a ban has happened. “The association has itself written to the government that people who have already made their films, who have completed their shooting, we should respect that. Let those movies release and whatever the government decides in the future, they will take a call on that,” he said.
The producer, however, chose not to comment on whether a ban on Pakistani artistes was justified, and said he was pained and saddened by the terrorist attacks. “I don’t want to comment on that (Pakistani actors ban). It is very sensitive. Right now everything is very heated, I don’t think it is the right moment to talk about it,” he said.
“But, it is decision of the government. They have to decide on what is right and what is wrong for us. My heart goes out and I strongly feel about Uri attack…,” he said at the launch of ‘Love Genration’ label.
Directed by Rahul Dholakia, “Raees” is set in 1980’s Gujarat. It tells the story of bootlegger Raees Khan (Shah Rukh), whose business is challenged and eventually thwarted by a police officer played by actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui."

Days after Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja M Asif threatened India with a nuclear strike during a television interview, US state department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner on Saturday said that nuclear-capable states have clear responsibility to exercise restraint.
“This is my message directly to the Pakistani authorities,” ANI quoted Toner as saying.

He also said that US urges action to deescalate and deligitimise terror groups like LeT, Haqqani network and JeM.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Stating that US was following the situation on the ground closely after India carried out surgical strikes along the LoC on late Wednesday night, he said that US was in continuous communication with Pakistan and India’s authorities to reduce tensions.
“We certainly don’t want to see any kind of escalation and any kind of break in that communication,” Toner said.
In a reference to Uri attack, Toner said that US has consistently ‘expressed concerns on the danger of cross-border terrorism in the region’."

PM Modi Interview: As he faces his biggest electoral test in just three months from now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday touched upon a gamut of contentious issues ranging from demonetisation to ordinance on Ram Mandir and even the mystery shrouding the sudden resignation of former RBI Governor Urjit Patel amid a months-long standoff with the government on economic capital framework and lending to MSMEs.

PM Modi on Ram Temple ordinance
Despite a clamour from Hindutva groups and RSS for a law on Ram Temple, PM Modi, in his first remarks on the issue, said an ordinance on the proposed temple would come only after the Supreme Court ruling. PM Modi also indicated that the judicial process was being slowed down because Congress lawyers were creating “obstacles” in the apex court.

“Let the judicial process be over. After the judicial process is over, whatever will be our responsibility as the government, we are ready to make all efforts,” PM Modi said in an interview with ANI. The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute will be taken up by the SC on Friday, where the CJI Ranjan Gogoi-led division bench will constitute a fresh three-judge bench to hear the issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asking the Congress not to create hurdles in the case, PM Modi said, “Don’t weigh it in political terms. Nobody can deny that those sitting in the governments in the last 70 years have tried their best to stall a solution to this (Ayodhya) issue.”
PM Modi on Urjit Patel
Shedding light on Urjit Patel’s sudden resignation, Modi said the former RBI Governor had told him six-seven months ago about his decision to quit and dismissed rumours that political pressure was at play.
“He himself requested (to resign) on personal reasons. I am revealing for the first time. He had been telling me about it for six-seven months before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. No question of political pressure. He did a good job as the RBI governor,” the PM said.

Speculation about Patel’s resignation had been going on for months before he resigned on December 10 after he resisted the government’s pressure to change policies on surplus dividend to the government, liquidity window for finance companies and more powers for the RBI Central Board.
PM Modi on demonetisation
One of the controversial policies of the Modi government was undoubtedly the decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8, 2016. In the interview, the PM said the note ban decision was not a “jhatka” and people were warned earlier about stashing of black money.
“This wasn’t a jhatka. We had warned people a year before, that if you have such wealth (black money), you can deposit it, pay penalties and you will be helped out. However, they thought Modi too would behave like others, so very few came forward voluntarily,” PM Modi said.

(File)
However, RBI’s report that over 99 per cent of banned notes were back in the system has given the Opposition a shot in the arm to corner the government on the issue even though Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has argued that the move helped widen the tax base.
The PM also said that it was because of demonetisation that diamantaire Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya fled to foreign countries. “Yeh kyun bhaagey? Notebandi ki wajah se. Those who fled during this government will be brought back – today or tomorrow. Those who have stolen India’s money will have to compensate for each and every penny,” he said.
PM Modi on Pakistan and surgical strikes
“Come back before sunrise, irrespective of the success or failure of the mission”. This was what PM Modi said to the commandos who went across the Line of Control to strike at terrorist camps after the Uri attack in 2016. Giving an upshot of the operation, PM Modi said the date of the attack was changed twice keeping in mind the safety and security of the troops.
On cross-border attacks, PM Modi said it would take more time for Pakistan to mend its ways. “Ek ladai se Pakistan sudhar jayega, yeh sochna bohot badi ghalti hogi. Pakistan ko sudharne mein abhi aur samay lagega. (It would be a mistake to think Pakistan can mend its ways after a battle, it will take more time,” PM Modi said.

Touching upon the Rafale deal, PM Modi said those levelling allegations of crony capitalism against him were actually weakening the security forces. Having received a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court, which ruled out a judicial probe into the deal, Modi said the government would continue to expedite the defence procurement process so that the country’s security was not compromised.
“Those people who want to weaken the Army are levelling allegations. I decided that whatever abuses are hurled at me, whatever allegations are levelled against me, I will continue on the path of honesty and give primacy to the country’s security. I won’t leave my Army jawans merely to their fate. Whatever be their requirement, I will expedite the procurement processes. I will do it even if allegations are levelled me,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi on Triple Talaq and Sabarimala
Refusing to compare the Triple Talaq and Sabarimala issues, PM Modi said while one was a matter of gender equality, the other was a matter of tradition. “Most Islamic countries have banned Triple Talaq. So it is not a matter of religion or faith. Even in Pakistan, Triple Talaq is banned. So it is an issue of gender equality, a matter of social justice. It is not an issue of faith,” he said.

Despite a drubbing in the Hindi heartland states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and with the prospect of a resurgent Congress-led Grand Alliance looking bright, PM Modi said the elections were going to be “janta” versus “gathbandhan”. “It is going to be ‘Janta’ versus ‘gathbandhan’.

Sources told The Sunday Express that the delegation to attend the Asian Parliamentary Assembly will be headed by former Minister of State (External Affairs) and current chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External affairs, Shashi Tharoor, and will include nominated MP in Rajya Sabha Swapan Dasgupta and BJP MP in Lok Sabha and party spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi.
Sources said that the group of Indian parliamentarians will travel on March 13 and will head to the picturesque town of Murree, about 30 km north-east of Islamabad, where the meeting is going to take place. Delegations from about 40 countries are likely to attend the conference. The delegation is expected to visit Takshashila on the last day, March 17.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said that while India boycotted the SAARC summit in November last year, along with other countries in the region, attending this summit is seen as a step towards normalising the relationship. The Indus water commissioners are also expected to attend a meeting on March 19-20 in Lahore, six months after government had talked about reviewing the Indus Water treaty in the wake of the Uri attacks.
Officials said that while these are two important signals to Pakistan, Islamabad has to follow through on its commitments to take action against Lashkar-e-Toiba chief and Jamaat-ud-Dawa founder Hafiz Saeed who has been put under house arrest under anti-terrorism laws of the country.
“The two sides will now be opening the doors…and the window of opportunity is quite slim, since Pakistan government will move towards the election mode by end of this year. Let’s see how things unfold from now onwards,” a source said. Parliamentary elections in Pakistan are due early next year.
There is a possibility of a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif on June 4 to 6 in Kazakhstan, where both will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Sources said that while it is too early to pin hopes of any substantive movement in the relationship, the relative calm on the terrorism front has been reassuring for the Indian side. However, efforts are underway to manage and contain the diplomatic fallout and not escalate the tense situation."

The summit was held at a time when India and Pakistan are at loggerheads over growing terrorist activities in the Valley and China’s move in United Nations where it used the veto to avoid designating JeM chief Masood Azhar a terrorist.

However, the word cross-border terrorism and Pakistan’s role in using terror as a tool against India did not find a voice in the Goa declaration. PM Narendra Modi repeatedly raised the issue of terrorism during the meet. On the first day of the summit, Modi targeted Pakistan calling it the ‘mothership’ of terrorism. “Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership. This country shelters not just terrorists. It nurtures a mindset,” Modi said during the meet on Sunday.
He reiterated the stand and called on BRICS nations to come together and act against terrorism and countries which were supporting it.

Chinese premier Xi Jinping, however, didn’t budge from his stand on Masood Azhar and India’s entry to the Nuclear Supplier’s Group (NSG).

Pakistan’s national flag carrier PIA on Wednesday cancelled flights to northern Pakistani cities due to “air space restrictions” in the wake of Uri terrorist attack. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) called off flights to Gilgit and Skardu in Gilgit-Baltistan region in Pakistan- occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.
“As per directives of CAA (Civil Aviation Authority), the air space over Northern areas will remain closed on Wednesday. Inconvenience regretted,” PIA spokesperson Danyal Gilani said on Twitter. He did not give any reason for closure of air space but officials said that Pakistani warplanes might be in the air to keep vigil due to Indo-Pak tensions after the Uri attack.

Eighteen soldiers were killed and over a dozen others injured as heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town early Sunday. Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed by the Army."

SEPOY RAJESH KUMAR SINGH, 33
BHAKURA VILLAGE, JAUNPUR (UP)
Sepoy Rajesh Kumar Singh’s brother, Umendra, had been awaiting his call from his new posting in Kashmir. Instead, what reached him was the news of Rajesh’s death. “He had gone about 20 days ago. We were not able to talk to him ever since then. And after all this wait, we got this news that he had been killed,” said Umendra, Rajesh’s brother. “I had spoken to him about one-and-a-half months ago and he asked about my family.”
Rajesh joined the Army about 12 years ago. Hailing from Jaunpur’s Bhakura village, he was the youngest of three brothers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Our family does not own much land. That is why my brother and I came to Lucknow for work, and Rajesh joined the Army. He used to be worried because his wife lived in the village, while his son was living in Varanasi. My father is a heart patient and he has not been able to say anything since he heard the news,” said Umendra.
Rajesh is survived his his wife, Julie, who lives at the family’s ancestral home in the village with his elderly parents. His son, Rishant, 10, lives with her maternal uncle in Varanasi.

“We don’t know how we can recover from this. How we will be able to support his wife and son. Each of us had less than one bigha as our share in the land,” said Umendra.

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar)
On September 21, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif addressed the 71st session of the UN General Assembly on the latest uprising in Kashmir, highlighting Indian “atrocities” — already seen by the world in disturbing TV coverage — and asking the house to implement the UN Security Council resolutions on the issue of Kashmir. Pakistan’s UN Permanent Representative Maleeha Lodhi had already told Pakistan earlier that his speech would focus on Kashmir — and not bring up other grievances against India — and that is what happened: Seventy per cent of the text dealt with what is going on in the Valley.
Back home, there was general satisfaction with the speech, which was important because speeches made at the UN General Assembly are meant for home consumption. However, a day earlier, Sharif had told the permanent members of the UN Security Council that “non-resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is a constant source of tension and instability in the region and a threat to international peace and security”. Needless to say, this was of no effect as China and the US were positioned against each other there, China issuing a strong supportive statement in favour of Pakistan and the US indirectly supporting India at the US Congress, where a resolution declaring Pakistan a terrorist state was tabled.
The September 17 attack by four armed men at Uri, killing 18 Indian troops, had fuelled the bilateral outrage. New Delhi accused Pakistan of sending them across the LoC. Both sides bristled. Military officers, retired and in-service, spread around the familiar rhetoric of war, arousing the two nations to a frenzy familiar to a tired world. Analysts said goodbye to objectivity and advised retaliatory aggression, an Indian general actually favouring a “deep strike” inside Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pakistan’s TV featured inarticulate army officers projecting unrealistic scenarios of Pakistan’s victory over India after a showdown for which Pakistan was “fully prepared”. Commentators normally critical of anti-India policies shrank into their shell of nationalism and abominated India as an evil state killing Kashmiri Muslims. On the Indian side, the Uri attack was exaggerated with details of how the four terrorists carried markings on their arms and ammunition proving they had been sent from Pakistan after training. Except that India’s foremost Kashmir-watching reporter, Praveen Swami, bravely came on TV to say this was “not yet” true.
Pakistan thought it could raise the Kashmir issue at the UNGA although a reluctant Nawaz Sharif knew nobody would buy it. When the temperature rises with India, all pacifists, including Nawaz Sharif, have to put on the warpaint for political survival. Before he talked to the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, Washington had already conveyed publicly that Pakistan would have to sort Kashmir out with India through talks. Pakistan had to digest a similar message from China. That is understandable if you calculate which foreign power stands to lose most if Pakistan were to tilt into another economically crippling tiff with India. Chinese investments, spread over the region, will stand threatened if another war is unleashed.
Pakistan is internally troubled by terrorism. The world knows more details of a nexus the terrorists enjoy with the Pakistani state than most Pakistanis realise. However, it must be said that under the current army chief, Raheel Sharif, more realistic critique of this internal bleeding of sovereignty is being aired. An example of how outspoken analysis has become in Pakistan was provided in a comment front-paged in the Dawn of September 20 by four highly regarded Pakistanis. A passage penned jointly by Inam ul Haque, Riaz Hussain Khokhar and Riaz Mohammad Khan, all former foreign secretaries, and retired major general Mahmud Durrani, a former ambassador to the US and national security adviser, is worth quoting: “The perception of Pakistan’s erstwhile support to extremist militancy in Kashmir in the 1990s and our association with the Taliban have hurt Pakistan’s international image. Of late, the delay in prosecuting especially those implicated in the Mumbai terrorist incident has been misconstrued as weak Pakistani commitment to fighting terrorism, the nemesis of all modern societies. This undermines Pakistan’s ability to forcefully advocate the Kashmir cause. Nothing will help India more than an evidence of outside militant elements blending with the indigenous Kashmiri uprising to justify its extreme violence in India-held Kashmir and its aggressive posture against Pakistan. We should be open to cooperating with any investigation into the Uri attack.”
Pakistan’s economy is in dire straits. Its sole big investor, China, is its only hope for the future. Any optimistic projections are completely dependent on the Chinese “economic corridor” from Gwadar to Xinjiang. Pakistan should talk to the Chinese seriously and ask them why they want Pakistan to negotiate peace with India through economic cooperation. The truth is India’s Narendra Modi is better placed to understand “enemy” China than the Pakistan army is to understand its “all-weather friend” in the north.
It is unfair to judge which country has lost out in the current Indo-Pak crisis. There is no doubt that Pakistan is internally unstable, its leaders bloodied by their cruel Thai boxing without rules of engagement. It is regionally and globally isolated as never before. But India is the high-flying state with unprecedented economic opportunity that must switch off the state violence destroying its image. The world is looking to it to temper its Hindu intensity. If this intensity declines into an internal brawl with secularism, it will loosen the glue that holds India together.
This round of bilateral madness will result in Pakistan failing to “internationalise” Kashmir. India may heat up the LoC because it hurts Pakistan more than India as Pakistani civilians live close to the border unlike the Indians on the other side. Once the smoke settles down, Pakistan and India must get together and “isolate” the Kashmir issue by creating more bilateral barriers to cross-LoC interference and normalise their economic relations, including consultations on another “economic corridor” that will allow India to trade with SAARC-member Afghanistan and the Central Asian states beyond. That Pakistan is increasingly aware of its internal trouble will help ease this process."

Injured during militant attack in Uri on September 18, Singh was under treatment at RR Hospital in New Delhi. Singh who was from Piprpati village of Bhojur District, Bihar is survived by his wife Kanchan Singh. His family members in Bhojur mourned his death after hearing the tragic news.

On September 18, in one of the worst terror attacks on the Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir, 17 Army personnel were killed and 20 were left injured by four heavily armed terrorists who sneaked into the administrative buildings and store complex of an infantry battalion in Uri, home of the 12 Infantry Brigade, near the Line of Control (LoC).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The four terrorists were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC.
A day after the attack another soldier had succumbed to his injuries taking the toll to 18. On September 26, another soldier, Pitabas Majhi of the Rashtriya Rifles Battalion in 2008, had gone on a combing operation in Uri and was injured in gunfire and succumbed to his injuries.
Army sources in J&K had said, as per their assessment, the terrorists probably infiltrated and familiarised themselves with the area. It was suspected that support of some kind of local intelligence was made available, guiding the terrorists to strike where they did at a particular time and place."

The J&K police have prepared a list of about 150 government employees, including gazetted officers, and sent it to deputy commissioners in the Valley, asking them to look into their role in the protests, that broke out after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani on July 8.
Officials said that six government employees, including a gazetted officer, have also been booked under the Public Safety Act — a law that allows the government to put a person behind bars for six months without a trial.

J&K government spokesperson and state education minister Nayeem Akhtar said, “This is a usual exercise by the administration to find out if there is any evidence (against these employees). If evidence is found against anybody, the law will take its own course — whether an employee or non-employee. Obviously, whoever creates trouble will have to pay for it.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said that district police chiefs in the Valley have prepared lists of government employees who, they believe, are part of protests or are “instigating” protesters. The lists — about 150 employees figure in them — have been forwarded to the deputy commissioners concerned.
“The deputy commissioners will start a departmental inquiry against these officials and, if their role in instigating protesters is found, action would be taken,” a senior police officer told The Indian Express.
A senior district officer in south Kashmir confirmed that he has received one such list. “Police have prepared these lists. They think these employees have a role in the protests and want the government to act against them,” he said. “We can only forward the lists to the departmental heads concerned, who can take action, if required.”
On the lists are names of six gazetted officers from south Kashmir, including a deputy chief education officer, a block development officer, an officer at Kashmir University and two college teachers.
Sources said several employees have been suspended or issued showcause notices by deputy commissioners, asking for an explanation over their “role in the protests”.
Those booked under the PSA include a headmaster of a government high school in Pulwama, who is set to retire in six months, two teachers and a storekeeper in the food and supplies department. Police sources said most government employees have been released on bail.
Akhtar said action would be taken on case-to-case basis. “The administration will go through the usual procedure. It can’t take action against any employee without going through the process laid down. No witch-hunting, but whatever is required for the ends of justice to meet, will be done,” he said."

Post-Uri attack, sudden silence 
Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj is a regular on Twitter, sometimes sending out as many as 20 tweets a day, responding to various requests for help from NRIs. But since September 18, the day of the Uri attack, Swaraj has tweeted sparingly. Some speculate that this is because Swaraj was piqued at not being called for the meeting of key ministers to discuss the government’s policy in the wake of the terror attack. A shift in the policy towards Pakistan was a key issue to be discussed.
Narayanan’s clout continues https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He may have retired as director, Intelligence Bureau, way back in 1992, but M K Narayanan still has an enormous hold over the organisation. Although he was closely associated with the Manmohan Singh government, having worked under Singh as NSA and later being appointed as the West Bengal governor, Narayanan was selected to deliver the keynote address at the IB’s centenary celebrations on September 24. What was even more surprising was that the lecture was named after A C M Nambiar, a little-known IB official who retired as joint director in the sixties. Nambiar was singled out for the honour reportedly because he was related to Narayanan.

Police to rescue in Divided Cong House 
In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is so badly divided that on Gandhi Jayanti, three factions of the party pitched as many tents at the grounds where Mahatma Gandhi’s statue is located in Bhopal. One camp supports Jyotiraditya Scindia, the other Kamal Nath and the third Digvijaya Singh. Local police had to be called in to separate the feuding groups which had gathered to pay homage to the apostle of non-violence. Incidentally, with no scope of an active role in the central leadership at present, Scindia is keen to join state politics. He has been touring the state in the hope of establishing himself as the prospective Congress chief ministerial candidate in the same way that Sachin Pilot has emerged as the CM contender in neighbouring Rajasthan. The hurdle is Madhya Pradesh Congress president Arun Yadav, also young like Scindia and who comes from a Congress family and is not ready to step aside in a hurry.
Before Metro, a forgotten initiator
The Delhi Metro has renamed some of its stations but why has no one thought of renaming Khan Market metro station after the late Congress chief executive councillor Jag Pravesh Chandra? The grand old man of Delhi is a legend who first pushed the idea of a rapid transport system for the Capital, long before anyone else ever seriously thought of it. Chandra wrote two booklets on the subject and raised the issue frequently in the Delhi Metropolitan Council, even though the idea was greeted with mirth. (It was BJP chief minister Madan Lal Khurana who years later gave the metro project in-principle approval.) Chandra came to Delhi as a refugee and was allotted a three-room accommodation in Khan Market. He never moved from his humble quarters and lived a life of Gandhian simplicity despite the powerful positions he held. Since Khan Market is named after Frontier Gandhi, it is only fitting that the metro station is named after its most famous resident who conceived the idea in the first place."

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday admitted that “something must have been wrong” because of which the Uri terror attack took place, and added that if required India is capable of “knee jerk reaction.” The minister, however, did not speak about the nature of reaction and added that the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take a call on it. He stressed that the government “is very serious” about it.
“Something must have been wrong… Though I will not go into details of it because it is a very sensitive matter. When something goes wrong while you try to correct it you should also ensure that it does not happen again,” Parrikar said at an event in New Delhi.
“I will not go into the details of what we are going to do. But if required I can have a knee-jerk reaction also. Sometimes a knee-jerk reaction is also required,” the minister said without elaborating. “This country is a very responsible power, that does not mean I will sleep over this kind of terrorism that is being pushed across the border. How I do it, is entirely for the government and Prime Minister to decide,” said Parrikar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We will take a proper reading of everything,” he said.
Parrikar also quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi as saying those behind the Uri terror attack will be punished and said: “We will look into how to punish. We are quite serious about it.”
Eighteen soldiers died in the terror attack on an army camp in Uri, in Jammu and Kashmir, on Sunday. Four terrorists who attacked the camp were also killed. The terrorists were said to be carrying food and medicine packets with Pakistani markings, and Director General of Military Operations Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh has spoken to his Pakistani counterpart expressing concern over the incident."

Havildar Nimb Singh Rawat, 48
Rajawa, Rajsamand (Rajasthan)
The last time Havildar Nimb Singh Rawat spoke to his family members was eight days ago. “He had spoken to his wife briefly. The mobile network here doesn’t allow for longer conversations,” says Laxman Singh, his younger brother.
The village, located about 15 km off the NH 8, is at the far end of a network of country roads, crisscrossing the undulating, rocky landscape dominated by the Aravallis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is 3 pm and the Rawat home is full of friends, relatives and others waiting for his body to arrive. Rawat is survived by wife Rodi Devi, daughters Asha (15), Deepa (13), Nisha (10), Payal (7) and son Chandan (5). Of the four Rawat brothers, Rawat was the only one with a job. “Arre Bhai da, kathe giyo paro (Brother, where have you gone),” wails Nimb’s younger brother Prabhu. His elder brother Rashu and his cousin Koonp Singh have accompanied the tehsildar to Udaipur to get the body home.
Speaking over the phone, Rashu says: “The government should do something to defeat terrorism, end it forever. Attack Pakistan if you have to, but please end this trouble and uncertainty for our soldiers.”
“We just want his children’s education to continue. How will his daughters get married now? The government should provide someone in the family with a job.”

Rawat was transferred to Uri 20 days ago from New Jalpaiguri. “He couldn’t come home before joining duty at his new posting. He came home for a month in July and left before Rakshabandhan,” says Rawat’s friend Havildar Narendra Singh, posted at Jabalpur."

Most were built after the Kargil war. (Express Photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)
Member of Panchayat of border village Rajoke , Sukhbir Singh (42) has constructed a ‘kothi’ — a big pucca house — a kilometre away from the India-Pakistan border. One can clearly get a view of Pakistan from atop his house.
As of now, he is rather disturbed with many advocating for “strong action” against Pakistan after the Uri attack. But then, he is confident there will be no war between India and Pakistan in the near future.

“The Uri attack was unfortunate and Pakistan is apparently involved in it. But it doesn’t mean we should attack Pakistan. There should be many other alternatives to tackle that country,” said Sukhbir Singh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Despite having fertile land and good savings, Sukhbir had not constructed a proper house for his family as he had been fearing war with Pakistan after having seen destruction of wars in 1965, 1971 and 1999.
These villages, however, have come out of this fear over the years after the Kargil war and now it is common to find big houses along the border. Punjab has 553-km long international border with Pakistan and 1,871 villages are notified as border area villages.  “Life in the border villages has always been very different. I have seen with my eyes that all the houses in our villages were made of mud because everybody feared there could be war anytime. Militancy also affected our villages most. Then Kargil happened. But despite that bitter experience, people decided to stay put in this border area and made investments. We don’t want any other war,” said Sawarn Singh, a police constable from Rajoke village.
“We were only watching Doordarshan during Kargil war. But now there are many news channels reaching our villages. Many channels are advocating war with Pakistan. But they should understand that if war happens now, Delhi and Lahore would be the first cities to face the heat of war. We do not favour war. Stability has come in our villages in the past 15 years and we don’t want to migrate again,” said Harnam Singh, a young farmer from Ratto Ke village.
His 80-year-old grandfather Subegh Singh said, “Politicians can do anything. People on both side of border are the first ones to suffer. We should be asked before launching any war against Pakistan.”
Local MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha said, “During the 1965 war, the Pakistan Army had infiltrated around 35 villages of my constituency and they took away whatever they could lay their hands on. You would be surprised to know that they even took away wooden doors of some homes. Mehdipur, Ratto Ke, Mari Ke, Khemkaran, Kalas, Mian Wala were among the most affected villages. There was more economic loss than human casualties as people had flee to safe places.”
He said people were again forced to leave their house during the Kargil war. “Then, mines were laid out in the fields alongside the border. Standing wheat was damaged and people were given negligible compensation. People of my village, too, had to move even though we are 10 km from border,” said Valtoha.
Warning that war would bring “unimaginable destruction”, the MLA added: “Why did the Uri attack happen? Because of infiltration from border with Pakistan. The Indian government should invest money on scientific techniques to seal the border. Science has made vigil inside deep sea possible. It is not impossible to seal the border on mountains. It is better to spend money on such techniques than on war. If war happened, this time destruction will be more than your imagination.”"

A top army general of Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday refused to accept the contention that a security lapse led to last week’s suicide attack on an army camp in Jammu and said it was a “frustrated” attempt by Pakistan after it failed to counter the army’s dominance at the LoC. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen D Anbu, who was presenting gallantry awards here, told reporters that the army is continuing with its “pro-active” strategy in the aftermath of the 2016 terror attack in which 17 soldiers died when terrorists stormed the brigade headquarters at Uri in North Kashmir.
The army commander of the strategically-important Northern Command, which looks after the borders from Ladakh to Jammu, maintained that the force would continue with its endeavour of ensuring zero infiltration, reports PTI.
“Infiltration does take place. We endeavour to ensure zero infiltration that is our job and we put our best effort,” he said. According to the officer, there was considerable reduction in infiltration, but the number of attempts almost doubled in 2007 compared to the previous year. The general said terrorists were always present at the camps and launching pads across the border to be pushed into India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If we take south and north of Pir Panjal, 185 to 220 are always present in south and 195-220 continue to remain in north,” Anbu said. South of Pir Panjal are the areas in Jammu and North is in Kashmir. On the Sunjuwan terror strike in the state on Saturday, he said, “It is the frustrated enemy (Pakistan) which does involve itself in such activities when it is not able to face us on the borders.” “It is but natural that the enemy is on the receiving end and looks for the easier alternative. While immediately behind the borders we have strengthened ourselves and we are very well prepared, it picked up soft targets,” he said.
The officer said that you cannot have the same security like in borders at areas which are peaceful. “I will not accept a single lapse on the border because it is supported to be protected. The Army spent almost Rs 364 crore on different things to build up the security of the soft elements on the LoC,” the officer said. “We got our acts together as far as surveillance, sentry duty and drills and other things are concerned besides the intelligence,” he said.
He said the army would not be cowed down by “small incidents” like “fidayeen” (suicide) attacks or other things and would rather work according to the strategy adopted after the Uri attacks. “We have adapted to it very well and in the whole year, we have dominated the adversary. It has been a pro-active action after the Uri incident and we have not looked back,” Anbu said. Militants on September 18, 2016, had stormed a battalion headquarters of the army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the early hours, killing 17 jawans and injuring 20 other personnel.
Anbu said Pakistan and its snooping agency ISI were directly involved in terrorism not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also in neighbouring countries. Anbu, who is the seniormost army officer in the command, said the army was prioritising security of small camps in vulnerable areas and those which need immediate attention. “The government has also come up with certain funds and I am sure we will be able not only to have a physical fence but also technology to assist it,” he said. On the casualties suffered by Pakistan in the retaliatory action to ceasefire violations, the officer said, “You do not come to know what is the damage caused across the border because our adversary does not believe in accepting the casualties. We are in a very dominating position.”
Though some media reports suggest that Pakistan suffered 192 fatal casualties along the LoC, the army is not going to put a figure because of the simple reason that Pakistan has only admitted to 13 casualties, he said."

Actor Vicky Kaushal began his journey in performing arts with theatre before he assisted Anurag Kashyap on Gangs of Wasseypur in 2010, and finally became the leading man in Phantom Films’ Masaan (2015), which got him much acclaim. Two years later, the actor has finished Meghna Gulzar’s film opposite Alia Bhatt and is set to begin working on Ronnie Screwvala’s next based on 2016 Uri attacks. The much-in-demand actor, however, has decided to revisit his theatre roots and will soon star in a play titled Chhatis Ghante.
The production has 10 writers write a play, which will then be picked at random by 10 directors, each getting 12 hours to make and put together a show. Being the actor in the show, Kaushal will only know who his director and which play he would be a part of 12 hours prior to the final performance, set to take place in Mumbai this month end.
The play is a part of an initiative by Rage Productions to raise funds for all the back-stage artists in theatre.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sharing his excitement about the play and its unique concept, Vicky Kaushal said in a statement, “I felt conceptually this play is extremely exciting because it will happen only this one time, and it is not going to be repeated ever. The concept is that before the show the actors are going to come to know of the co-actors, script, the director only 12 hours before the show. So, whatever they have to do is in those 12 hours that they have to prepare the play so that for me was very exciting to take part in the play. Because it’s just a one-day commitment, with such noble initiative and also very exciting process for a creative person involved, I am very excited to be a part of this.”
Vicky will begin shooting for Screwvala’s real-life inspired film early next year. Titled Uri, the movie is about the Indian army’s surgical strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir that was carried out after the September 2016 Uri terror attacks. It will be directed by debutante Aditya Dhar, and have Kaushal play an army officer. Rest of the cast hasn’t been announced yet."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27, the same day as Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who will speak after Modi.
This will be the first time since 2014 that Modi will take the podium at the UNGA; for the next four years (UNGA’s 70th-73rd session, 2015-18), the Assembly was addressed by the late External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj.
The UNGA has frequently served as a platform for India-Pakistan jousting, mainly over Jammu and Kashmir, in front of an international audience.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Five years ago, in 2014, there was a mood of hope — Modi had surprised everyone by inviting his then Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif for his first swearing-in, and Sharif had brought along a “message of peace”. While Modi’s government had cancelled the foreign secretary-level talks scheduled for that August after Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India met with Kashmiri separatist leaders, there was still speculation that the two Prime Ministers could meet on the UNGA sidelines.
However, at the UNGA session, Sharif spoke of “violence and abuse of fundamental rights” in Kashmir, and the two PMs left without a bilateral meeting.
Five years on, Modi is back with a stronger majority, Article 370 has been abrogated, Pakistan has been making every attempt to bring international attention to Kashmir, and the ties between the two countries have nosedived.

Imran, who has been using inflammatory language in his attacks on India and Modi personally, is almost certain to focus his speech on Kashmir and India’s alleged violation of human rights in the Valley.

In the speaking order, Prime Ministers speak before the External Affairs ministers, and that’s how, India and Pakistan don’t have fixed order of speaking at the UNGA.
Here’s a summary of the UNGA addresses by Indian and Pakistani leaders over the past five years.
2014
Modi: “Friendship with neighbours highest priority”
The PM said India was prepared to hold bilateral talks, while reminding Pakistan of the “responsibility to create an appropriate environment”.
“India desires a peaceful and stable environment for its development. A nation’s destiny is linked to its neighbourhood. That is why my government has placed the highest priority on advancing friendship and cooperation with her neighbours,” Modi had said.
“This includes Pakistan. I am prepared to engage in a serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan in a peaceful atmosphere, without the shadow of terrorism, to promote our friendship and cooperation. However, Pakistan must also take its responsibility seriously to create an appropriate environment.
“Raising issues in this forum is not the way to make progress towards resolving issues between our two countries. Instead, today, we should be thinking about the victims of floods in Jammu and Kashmir. In India, we have organised massive flood relief operations, and have also offered assistance for Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.”
Nawaz Sharif: “We cannot draw a veil on the issue of Kashmir”
“Many generations of Kashmiris have lived their lives under occupation, accompanied by violence and abuse of their fundamental rights. Kashmiri women, in particular, have undergone immense suffering and humiliation,” Sharif said in his address.
“For decades, attempts have been made, both under UN auspices and bilaterally in the spirit of the Lahore Declaration, to resolve this dispute. The core issue of Jammu and Kashmir has to be resolved.This is the responsibility of the international community. We cannot draw a veil on the issue of Kashmir, until it is addressed in accordance with the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.
2015
Sushma Swaraj: “Give up terrorism, sit down and talk”
In March 2015, there were back-to-back terrorist attacks on the Rajbagh police station on the Jammu-Pathankot highway and an Army camp at Maheshwar near Samba, followed, that July, by the attack on the Dinanagar police station in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district.
At the UNGA, Sharif proposed a new “four-point peace initiative”, and External Affairs Minister Swaraj responded that only one point, not four, was needed — and that was for Pakistan to stop terrorism against India.
“While on the subject of terrorism, I take the opportunity to share the challenges that we face in our ties with Pakistan… We all know that these attacks are meant to destabilize India and legitimize Pakistan’s illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir and its claim on the rest of it,” Swaraj said.
“Let me use this occasion to spell out our approach clearly. India remains open to dialogue. But talks and terror cannot go together. Yesterday the Prime Minister of Pakistan proposed what he termed as a four-point new peace initiative. I would like to respond. We do not need four points, we need just one — give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk.”
Sharif: “3 generations of Kashmiris saw broken promises, brutal oppression”
Sharif said: “Since 1947, the Kashmir dispute has remained unresolved. UN Security Council resolutions have remained unimplemented. Three generations of Kashmiris have only seen broken promises and brutal oppression. Over 100,000 have died in their struggle for self-determination. This is the most persistent failure of the United Nations.
“When I assumed office… in June 2013 for the third time, one of my first priorities was to normalize relations with India… Yet today ceasefire violations along the Line of Control and the Working Boundary are intensifying, causing civilian deaths including [those of] women and children.”
2016
Swaraj: “Egregious abuses in Balochistan”
The year saw Pathankot terrorist attack, and then the Uri attack.
After Pakistan raised the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in July that year, Swaraj responded by criticising Pakistani abuses in Balochistan.
“In our midst, there are nations that still speak the language of terrorism, that nurture it, peddle it, and export it. To shelter terrorists has become their calling card. We must identify these nations and hold them to account. On 21st September, the Prime Minister of Pakistan used this podium to make baseless allegations about human rights violations in my country. I can only say that those accusing others of human rights violations would do well to introspect and see what egregious abuses they are perpetrating in their own country, including in Balochistan. The brutality against the Baloch people represents the worst form of state oppression.”
Sharif: “Will share with UN proof of India violating human rights”
“A new generation of Kashmiris has risen spontaneously against India’s illegal occupation — demanding freedom from occupation,” Sharif had said. “Burhan Wani, the young leader murdered by Indian forces, has emerged as the symbol of the latest Kashmiri Intifada, a popular and peaceful freedom movement, led by Kashmiris, young and old, men and women, armed only with an undying faith in the legitimacy of their cause, and a hunger for freedom in their hearts… I would like to inform the General Assembly that Pakistan will share with the Secretary General a dossier containing detailed information and evidence of the gross and systematic violations of human rights committed by Indian forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
2017
Swaraj: “We produced scholars, doctors, engineers. You produced terrorists”
The year saw Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was in Pakistan’s custody, sentenced to death by a Pakistan’s military court and India approached the ICJ.
In one of her most scathing speeches, Swaraj said: “On Thursday, from this dais, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi wasted rather too much of his speech in making accusations against us. He accused India of State-sponsored terrorism, and of violating human rights. Those listening had only one observation: ‘Look who’s talking!’
“India and Pakistan became free within hours of each other. Why is it that today India is a recognised IT superpower in the world, and Pakistan is recognised only as the pre-eminent export factory for terror? We produced scholars, doctors, engineers. What have you produced? You have produced terrorists. Doctors save people from death; terrorists send them to death.”
Shahid Khaqan Abbasi: “UN must send Inquiry Commission to Kashmir
Prime Minister Abbasi spoke of the “heroic and popular struggle” of Kashmiris “to rid themselves of India’s oppressive rule”, and India’s use of “massive and indiscriminate force” to suppress them. “Pakistan demands an international investigation into India’s crimes in Kashmir. We ask that the United Nations Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights send an Inquiry Commission to occupied Kashmir to verify the nature and extent of India’s human rights violations… To this end, the UN Secretary-General should appoint a Special Envoy on Kashmir. His mandate should flow from the longstanding but unimplemented resolutions of the Security Council.”

Swaraj: “Pakistan glorifies killers”
Although Pakistan got a new PM Imran Khan, the verbal duel continued and India cancelled the meeting between Foreign ministers after agreeing to them.
After Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi accused India of involvement in the 2014 Peshawar school attack, Swaraj responded: “We are accused of sabotaging the process of talks. This is a complete lie. We believe that talks are the only rational means to resolve the most complex of disputes. Talks with Pakistan have begun many times. If they stopped, it was only because of Pakistan’s behaviour.
“Time and again, Pakistan accuses India of human rights violations. Who can be a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? Those who take innocent human lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behaviour, not of human rights. Pakistan glorifies killers; it refuses to see the blood of innocents.”
Foreign Minister Qureshi: “Will never forget Samjhauta attack, Peshawar attack”
Qureshi had said that Pakistan would “never forget the mass murder of more than 150 children in a Peshawar school [in 2014], the terrible Mastung attack [in July 2018] and many others that have links with terrorists supported by India… (as well as) the terrorist attack in India against Samjhota Express carrying innocent Pakistanis”. He said that Pakistan had in its custody “a serving Indian Naval officer, Commander Kulbhushan Yadav, who has provided us with the most incriminating evidence by accepting that he, on the instructions of his government, financed, planned and executed acts of terrorism and violence in Pakistan”.
Qureshi also raised a UN report on alleged human rights violations in Kashmir that India had rejected: “Pakistan welcomes the recently released report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It vindicates our position. No longer the excuse of terrorism can be used to continue to systematically oppress the Kashmiri people.”"

In a veiled but obvious reference to Pakistan, influential regional bloc BIMSTEC on Monday called for “strong” measures against nations which encourage, support and finance terror groups, provide sanctuaries to them and “falsely” extol their virtues, seen as an endorsement of India’s effort to corner Islamabad on terrorism.

The bloc said fight against terrorism should not only confine to disrupting and eliminating terror groups and their networks but states supporting them must also be punished.
An Outcome Document detailing deliberations among the BIMSTEC leaders at their retreat here last night, said they condemned the recent “barbaric terror” attacks in the region in strongest terms, seen as a reference to Pathankot and Uri strikes.

“We strongly believe that our fight against terrorism should not only seek to disrupt and eliminate terrorists, terror organisations and networks, but should also identify, hold accountable and take strong measures against states which encourage, support and finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups, and falsely extol their virtues,” the grouping said in the document issued today.
It said the leaders stressed on urgent measures to counter terrorism.
“There should be no glorification of terrorists as martyrs. We recognise the need for urgent measures to counter and prevent the spread of terrorism, violent extremism and radicalisation. We express our determination to take concrete measures to step up cooperation and coordination among our law enforcement, intelligence and security organisations,” it said.
India has been scaling up efforts to isolate Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing BRICS and BIMSTEC summits in Goa on Sunday, called Pakistan a “mother ship” of global terrorism and said the menace has become its “favourite child”.
The strong position of BIMSTEC in dealing with terror assumes significance as it comes after consensus eluded on reference to cross-border terror in BRICS declaration.
“Recognising that terrorism continues to remain the single most significant threat to peace and stability in our region, we reiterate our strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stress that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever,” BIMSTEC said.
It said the leaders expressed commitment to expedite the signing of the BIMSTEC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and to early ratification of the BIMSTEC Convention on Cooperation in Combating International Terrorism, Transnational Organized Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking.
The bloc also deliberated on a range of issues like ways to improve connectivity, enhance trade, promote energy cooperation and tourism.
The group said the leaders agreed to explore the possibility of having a BIMSTEC Motor Vehicle Agreement to improve connectivity. The decision comes in the backdrop of Pakistan stalling a similar pact among the SAARC countries last year.
To boost energy cooperation, the group also decided to expedite the signing of the BIMSTEC MoU on Grid Interconnection."

The Ministry of External Affairs, which summoned Pakistan’s acting envoy, lodged a protest after the latest Jaish bid to carry out terror strikes in J&K ahead of the District Development Council elections.
It demanded that Pakistan desist from its policy of supporting terrorists and dismantle the terror infrastructure on its territory.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry also summoned the Indian chargé d’affaires in Islamabad to reject what it called were allegations to “implicate Pakistan in some alleged planned attack in Nagrota”.
The Indian warning of taking “all necessary measures to safeguard its national security” came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed to cross-border terror from Pakistan and thanked security forces for having “defeated a nefarious plot” to target grassroots democracy in J&K.
India carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control after the Uri attack in September 2016, and air strikes in Balakot after the Pulwama attack in February 2019.
In a statement Saturday, the MEA said, “A major terror attack was foiled by Indian security forces in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir on 19 November 2020. Initial reports indicate the attackers to be members of Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terrorist organization proscribed by the United Nations and several countries. The Government of India expressed its serious concerns at continued terror attacks by JeM against India.”
“JeM has been part of several attacks in India in the past, including the Pulwama attack in February 2019. The huge cache of arms, ammunition and explosive material indicate detailed planning for a major attack to destabilise peace and security in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, in particular, to derail the ongoing democratic exercise of conduct of local District Development Council elections,” it said.
“Pakistan Cd’A was summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs and a strong protest was lodged at the attempted attack, which was only prevented from happening by the alertness of the Indian security forces. It was demanded that Pakistan desist from its policy of supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from its territory and dismantle the terror infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries.”
“India reiterated its long standing demand that Pakistan fulfil its international obligations and bilateral commitments to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner,” the MEA said.
“The Government of India is firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security in the fight against terrorism,” it said.
Meanwhile, an Army Havildar was killed and another soldier injured as Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked mortar shelling and small arms fire Saturday along the Line of Control in Rajouri district of J&K.
Army spokesperson Lt Colonel Devender Anand said ceasefire violations from across the LoC took place in the morning and again in the evening.
He said Havildar Patil Sangram Shivaji of Kolhapur was killed in action in the Nowshera sector. “He was a brave, highly motivated and a sincere soldier. The nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,” Lt Colonel Anand said.
Officials said another soldier sustained injuries and is undergoing treatment at a military hospital. The Army, officials said, retaliated effectively to silence the Pakistani guns.
According to an ENS report from Pune, 38-year-old Patil of 16 Maratha Light Infantry hailed from Nigave Khalsa village in Karvir taluka of Kolhapur district. He belonged to a family of farmers. He was the second soldier from Kolhapur district to be killed in action along the LoC in over a week’s time."

India and Russia on Saturday affirmed the need for “zero tolerance” for terrorists and their supporters even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed to President Vladimir Putin his appreciation of Kremlin’s unequivocal condemnation of the Uri attack during their talks on terrorism, including that emanating from Pakistan.
“Russia’s clear stand on the need to combat terrorism mirrors our own. We deeply appreciate Russia’s understanding  and support of our actions to fight cross-border terrorism, that threatens our entire region. We both affirmed the need for zero tolerance in dealing with terrorists and their supporters,” Modi said at a joint media event with Putin after their annual summit in Benalium.

Asked if the issue of cross-border terrorism emanating  from Pakistan figured during the talks, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said, “The restricted form did cover Uri and support given for the terror strike (by Pakistan).” He said a more detailed conversation between Modi and Putin on the driving forces behind terrorism would take place at the lunch hosted by the Prime Minister. On his part, Putin said the two countries were closely cooperating in the fight against terror.
“President Putin reaffirmed Russia’s continued commitment to the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership with India and noted the commonality of positions of both the countries on such issues as war on terrorism. Indian Side expressed its appreciation for Russia’s unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attack on army base in Uri,” a joint statement issued after the talks said.
India, which has conveyed its opposition to Russia undertaking joint military exercises with Pakistan, a country which “sponsors and practices terrorism as a matter of State policy”, also said it was “satisfied” about Russia understanding its interests.
“We are satisfied that Russia understand India’s interest and they will never do anything contrary to India’s interest and I think there was a strong meeting of minds on this subject,” Jaishankar said when asked about the Russian response to India’s concern over the recent Pak-Russia joint military exercise. The Foreign Secretary also asserted that the assumption of friendship with Russia, “which was more than a partner”, was that India trusts that they will not do anything contrary to its interest."

The Pakistani media reported Wednesday that Sartaj Aziz, Advisor on Foreign Affairs to the Pakistan Prime Minister, admitted that the government was presented with “insufficient evidence” on alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav who is under detention.
Hours later, the Pakistan foreign ministry said the statement attributed to Aziz was “absolutely incorrect”.
Indian government sources said they were yet to check the authenticity of the statement, although it was in line with the Indian point of view. “The Pakistan Senate is not in session,” a government source told The Indian Express.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Aziz was in Amritsar on December 3-4 for the Heart of Asia Conference which was addressed, among others, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani.
Geo TV and Dawn reported that Aziz, while briefing the Senate about Pak-India relations and skirmishes along the LoC, said the dossier on Jadhav contained mere statements. “It did not have any conclusive evidence,” he was quoted saying.

“What the dossier contained was not enough. Now it is up to the concerned authorities how long they take to give us more matter on the agent,” Aziz told the Senate, the report said.
Jadhav, who was reportedly arrested in Balochistan on his entry from Iran, was accused by Pakistan of planning “subversive activities” in the country. The Pakistan Army had also released a “confessional video” of Jadhav who said he was a serving Indian Navy officer.
India has acknowledged Jadhav as a retired Navy officer, but denied the allegation that he was in any way connected to the government.
Responding to a media query on Aziz’s statement regarding Jadhav, the Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson said that the statement attributed to the Advisor was “absolutely incorrect”.
“The Advisor had said that the investigations regarding the network of Kulbhushan Yadav are ongoing and the dossier shall be completed upon conclusion of the investigation. There is irrefutable proof against Kulbhushan Yadav, who had also made a public confession in March this year,” the ministry said."

As evening descended in Uri town on Monday, bodies of four militants who had attacked an Army camp inside the Brigade headquarters on Sunday morning were quietly buried in a graveyard adjacent to the garrison here.
“They (the Army) called police officers and a group of eight-ten people from the town, and handed over the bodies for last rites. Army officers did not want the bodies to be taken out of the garrison till it was time for the burial,” a local, who did not wish to be named, told The Indian Express. “The bodies were handed over only after the search operation had concluded.”
“Both the Army and the local civilian administration were apprehensive that if the bodies of the militants are taken out for post-mortem and last rites, a large crowd may gather. It can happen because people are curious,” another local said. “They were apprehensive that there could be a protest. Anything can happen once a crowd gathers. So nobody from the Army or the administration wanted to take any chances.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Monday morning, an ambulance of the J&K health service department went to the Brigade headquarters. A senior health department official said the Army had requested them to send a team to conduct an autopsy of the four militants. “As per the report of the doctors who conducted the autopsy, the militants were in their mid 20s,” a health department official said.
Locals said that members of the Uri bazaar committee, an Imam and a few elders from the town were called to arrange the last rites. Sources said a team of the National Investigation Agency had also arrived, and it was only after they had inspected the bodies that the four militants were buried.
One of the locals said that those called in to perform the last rites were not allowed to see the faces of the militants. “They took the bodies, offered jinaza (funeral prayers) and buried the bodies in a hurry,” he said.

The decision to bury the militants in Uri was a departure from the norm because bodies of foreign militants in north Kashmir are generally buried at Kitchama graveyard, located 25 km from Uri town and set up exclusively for this purpose.
Meanwhile, there was a tense calm in Uri town. The main market was shut and people sat in groups on shop fronts, discussing the attack and its ramifications. There wasn’t any Army movement in the town, though. The toll gate where the road enters the garrison area was closed but there weren’t any soldiers standing around. The bunker adjacent to it was also empty as soldiers kept vigil from inside the garrison.
At 11 am, there were two loud blasts which caused fear among people, who apprehended another attack. The Army had detonated the leftover explosives. There was a similar blast at 3 pm.
As the night fell and the lights of the Brigade headquarters were switched on, Uri looked peaceful. Inside the homes, however, people remained anxious. Nobody thinks that there is going to be a war. But that isn’t comforting to a people who will be among the first to be at the receiving end if cross-LoC shelling were to resume."

MNS ended their protest against Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Raees on Saturday morning after a closed-door meeting between party supremo Raj Thackeray, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Karan Johar, Mukesh Bhatt and others.
Claiming victory and satisfaction at having achieved their demands, Thackeray revealed that he has received assurances from the film industry that henceforth they wouldn’t be working with any Pakistani actors. Raj also set forth conditions that filmmakers who worked with Pakistan actors will have to comply with.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Elaborating on what transpired in the early morning meet, he said, “In the meeting with Mukesh Bhatt and others, I told them when Pakistan wants, it releases our films when they don’t want they ban our films and bans our channels. Then why are you time and again rolling out the red carpet for them? Is there any such really big star there that you have to take them in films here? No need of all these things.”
As a solution to filmmakers who have worked with Pakistani actors in the past, the MNS chief had this to offer, “When CM asked me what solution could be offered, I told them before the start of the movie, they should put up a message slate saying that we are offering our respects and prayers to the URI martyrs and all those soldiers who lost their lives in earlier terror attacks and we salute our jawans. We will also need a written undertaking Producers Guild that they will not work with any Pakistani artistes, singers or technicians. So they have agreed. Apart from these, they will talk to the CM and decide how much money they will give. I have told them by way of penance, every producer who has worked with Pakistani artistes — be it Shah Rukh Khan or Karan Johar — they should give Rs 5 crore to the army welfare fund. They should hand over the cheque to Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar, click a picture and show it to people. Now how much money they will give is something they will tell the CM and then tell us.”
Claiming victory and satisfaction at having achieved a victory, Raj said, “It’s a victory of our protest that Pakistan actors will not work in our films anymore. From today they will not engage with Pak actors. Those who have already completed shooting that producer should atone. I also don’t think the films that will have Pakistani actors people of India will go to watch it.”

The politician also bashed the film industry for not understanding time and again why it is important to not have Pakistani actors in Indian cinema.
“MNS has many times protested against Pakistani artistes in the past but people from the film industry never understood. Now they will realise and understand. When the CM asked me if any solution was possible, I asked what solution could be offered when these people don’t want to understand anything at all. We have tried telling them so many times but finally, it looks like they are only pretending to not understand. Uri attacks or Pathankot like attacks have been happening in India since long. Bomb blasts and many other attacks have happened in India many times.”"

Pakistan on Monday accused India of misleading the world opinion to cover up its ‘reign of terror’ in Kashmir by a spate of ‘vitriolic’ and ‘unsubstantiated’ statements following the terror attack in Uri that killed 17 soldiers.
“Pakistan has noted with serious concern the recent spate of vitriolic and unsubstantiated statements emanating from Indian civil and military leadership in the aftermath of yesterday’s attack” in Uri, Sartaj Aziz, the advisor to Pakistan Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, said.
He said Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible accusations being levelled by senior officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
‘It is a blatant attempt on India’s part to deflect attention from the fast deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation’ in Kashmir since the death of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani.
He said that the situation in Kashmir is not of Pakistan’s making but a direct consequence of ‘illegal Indian occupation and a long history of atrocities that has resulted in over a 100 thousand deaths’.
“Nobody has been spared the brute state force including the elderly, wounded patients in hospitals as women and children. This should awaken international conscience,” Aziz said.
Reacting to Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s statement Pakistan is a ‘terrorist state’ and should be isolated, Aziz said that it was deplorable that the Indian Minister chose to blame Pakistan for the incident even prior to conducting proper investigation.
“The statement is part of a pattern to mislead world opinion and cover up India’s reign of terror in Kashmir,” the statement said.
Heavily-armed militants stormed the rear quarters of a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours on Sunday, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the attack in which all four terrorists were neutralised.
It was the worst attack on the Indian Army in many years."

Advocates of the Amritsar Bar Association (ABA) have demanded a complete snapping of ties with Pakistan after the killing of 18 soldiers in a terrorist strike in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir.
Holding a “Lalkar” rally from Amritsar to the Attari-Wagah border check post on Thursday, the advocates raised slogans against Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N government.

“The protocol that we will follow is total shutdown. We do not want any relations with them,” he added.
On Sunday, a militant attack on an army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, has claimed the lives of eighteen soldiers. While 17 soldiers died on Sunday, the army confirmed that one more critically injured soldier succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, pushing the death toll to 18.

Seeking to defend senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s remarks comparing deaths related to demonetisation with the casualties in the Uri terror attack, party leader Anand Sharma on Friday flayed the BJP for giving a “communal twist” to the matter.
“Ghulam Nabi Azad is not just the leader of the opposition (in the Rajya Sabha) but has been the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. There have been 26 bids on his life by terrorists, a man who always stood for the nation, do we have such a situation now that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will decide who is a nationalist and who is not,” Sharma told the media outside parliament.

THE Modi government on Thursday said that Foreign Ministers of India and Pakistan’s newly elected government will meet in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week. The last formal engagement between the Foreign Ministers took place in December 2015 in Islamabad, which was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden visit to Lahore.
This meeting between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in New York has been scheduled after Pakistan’s newly elected Prime Minister Imran Khan proposed a meeting between the two ministers in a letter to Prime Minister Modi.
“I can confirm that on the request of the Pakistani side, a meeting between EAM and Pakistani foreign minister will take place on the sidelines of UNGA at a mutually convenient date and time,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Thursday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

This will be the first ministerial-level engagement with Pakistan under the new Imran Khan-led government.
An informal meeting of SAARC foreign ministers will take place in New York on the sidelines of the UNGA session. It is expected to take place around September 26-27. Swaraj and Qureshi will head the delegations of their respective countries to the UNGA.
However, Kumar said the meeting doesn’t signal a resumption of the bilateral dialogue. “This is just a meeting, not talks or resumption of dialogue… I want you to distinguish between a meeting and a dialogue,” he said.
“Is mulaqat ko sirf mulaqat ke tarah hi dekhiye (See this meeting as just a meeting)”, he told reporters.
Sources in New Delhi played down the meeting as the government is going to face general elections next year.
READ | Imran Khan to Modi: Only way forward is ‘constructive engagement’
Swaraj and then Pakistan Foreign minister Sartaj Aziz had decided to resume the comprehensive bilateral dialogue process in December 2015, which was interrupted in January 2016 after the Pathankot terror attack.
The relationship, which had seen some bright prospects after Modi’s visit to Lahore to wish then Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, nosedived after the Pathankot attack. And, while back-channel communication between National Security Advisors Ajit K Doval and Nasser Khan Janjua continued, the capture and subsequent death sentence of former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav in March-April 2016 marred ties.
The chill deepened with Uri terror attack in September 2016 and retaliatory surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by the Indian armed forces.
The MEA spokesperson remained firm on the issue of terrorism and said that “there is no change in India’s stance” – responding to whether there is a shift in the position that “talks and terror can’t go together”. He said that the agenda for discussions is yet to be decided.
However, the window of opportunity for a meeting has been created by Pakistan’s PM’s letter, where he says, “Pakistan remains ready to discuss terrorism”.
In a letter to Modi, Khan has said the only way forward for the two countries is through “constructive engagement”.
“Pakistan and India have an undeniably challenging relationship. We, however, owe it to our people, especially the future generations, to peacefully resolve all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, to bridge differences and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome,” said his letter dated September 14.
While the MEA spokesperson said that issues to be discussed are yet to be decided, he did confirm that the issue of Kartarpur corridor will be raised by Swaraj.
“Even now after so many years, we don’t have any official communication from the Pakistani government that they are willing to consider this matter. the External Affairs Minister will, therefore, raise this issue in her meeting with the Pakistan Foreign Minister,” Kumar said.
It has been India’s long-standing demand to allow pilgrims enter Pakistan and visit the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur in Pakistan’s Narowal district. The gurdwara is built at the resting place of Guru Nanak. The issue gained prominence recently after Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu claimed he was told by Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa that Islamabad would grant access to the gurdwara on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in 2019.
The government also said that Swaraj will participate in the SAARC foreign ministers’ meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA. The first day of the high-level UNGA debate will begin on September 25 and will last for nine working days.
Whether there is a possibility of a SAARC summit, the MEA spokesperson made it clear that the atmosphere is not conducive, echoing India’s position since the SAARC summit was cancelled in September 2016, after the Uri attack."

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday said surgical strikes across the LoC reflect firm will power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and valour of armed forces. “The surgical strikes were a result of firm will power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and valour of our forces,” the Chief Minister said in an interview to PTI.

“Demanding a proof of it is not correct principally as well as practically. Such proofs are never given. Those who are demanding proof are not aware of the consequences of disclosing the details of this military operation,” he said.
Surgical strikes were carried out on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, with the Army saying it had inflicted “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK, days after Modi warned Uri attack would not go unpunished."

Singh said the surgical strikes were a successful tactical operation that conveyed a clear message to Pakistan to stop any misadventure along the Line of Control (LoC).

Hooda, who was the Northern Army Commander in September 2016 when Indian troops carried out the strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control in the wake of the Uri attack, has said there was an “attempt to keep a purely military operation in the political domain by selective leaks of videos, photographs etc”. Responding to a question from the audience, Hooda said in hindsight, it would have been better had the strikes been done secretly.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh, the then Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who had announced the operation at a press conference, refused to comment on the politicisation of the operation. “From military point of view, these were successful tactical operations, which conveyed a very strategic message and the Indian Army was able to convey a very clear message to Pakistan that should they not stop any kind of misadventure along the LoC, they shall be given befitting reply,” Singh told reporters here on the sidelines of his visit to Sainik School, his alma mater.
He further said surgical strike is only one of the options through which we stop infiltration, adding that the armed forces have a range of options and they are being analysed at all times and the best course of action is put into effect."

An organisation of Kashmiri Pandits on Saturday held a protest at Jantar Mantar here over the recent terror strike in Uri and pitched for stringent measures, both by the Centre and the state government to combat such attacks in the Valley.
All Parties Migrants Coordination Committee (APMCC) staged the protest followed by a candle march to pay homage to martyrs of Uri attack.

“State and central governments should take stringent measures to combat growing terrorist attacks in the Valley. We hope peace prevails and the tormentors are brought to book”, head of APMCC Delhi-NCR, Ravinder Pandita said.
“The recent violence in Kashmir that begun on July 8 after (militant commander) Burhan Wani’s killing has evoked a total protest across the Valley with separatists calling the shots. Kashmiri Hindus in the Valley have been forced to leave their hearth and homes and save their lives,” he claimed.

The resolution came on a day the Indian Army announced that seven terror launch pads were targeted across the LoC by special forces during a ‘surgical strike’ overnight in which heliborne and ground forces were used. Producer Ashoke Pandit, a member of the IMPPA, said, “IMPPA paid homage to the martyrs who were killed in Uri.

The decision came amid demands by various political outfits to ban Pakistani artistes from Indian films and performing here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Last week, Raj Thackeray-led MNS issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Pakistani artistes and actors including Fawad Khan and Ali Zafar, to leave India by September 25 or else they would be “pushed out”.
Also, apparently the popular Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan has been dropped from his upcoming film “Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laddoo Deewana”. Recently the concerts of Pakistani singers Shafqat Amanat Ali and Atif Aslam scheduled in Bengaluru and Gurgaon respectively were also cancelled.

While the district administration has “advised” the concert team Konceptentertainment to defer Atif’s show, the organisers have said they had already decided to postpone the gig “indefinitely” after the attack at Uri in Kashmir. “Considering the sentiments of armed forces and soldiers at the frontier, the organisers are advised by the district administration of Gurgaon to defer the Atif Aslam concert,” said Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon, TL Satyaprakash in a statement.
Shafqat’s concert was called off after the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Bangalore Police asking it not to allow Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali to perform on September 30."

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday said the firing from across the border had stopped in the last two days as the enemy was feeling the heat of retaliation. “After the surgical strike, the cowardly attacks continued which were retaliated strongly by our Armed Forces on the border. Our response to their attacks was strong.
“The day before yesterday we got a call from them pleading us to stop the retaliation,” Parrikar said, referring to request for DGMO-level talks from Pakistan.

He was speaking at a rally at Sankhalim village in Goa.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We told them that we don’t mind stopping (the counter attacks) as we are not interested in it, provided they too stop it. For last two days, the firing has stopped from across the border,” the Defence Minister said.
“For the first time Union Government allowed the Army to enter PoK and teach lesson to those involved in the cowardly act against our forces,” he said, referring to surgical strike after Uri attack.
“There is no doubt that our Armed Forces are brave but also for the first time, country’s leadership took strict policy decision (to allow the surgical strike),” he said.
His becoming the Defence Minister was a way to repay a debt of Armed Forces which liberated Goa from Portuguese rule in 1961, Parrikar said.
“When I was invited to join the Union Cabinet, I was not willing. It was hurting me to leave Goa. But when Prime Minister requested, I had to take up the responsibility.”
“As a Goan I was always indebted to the Armed Forces which has given my freedom to me. Unlike Britishers, Portuguese did not leave the country peacefully. They were forced out by our Armed Forces. This was an opportunity for me to thank Indian Army for liberating Goa,” he said."

THREE DAYS before it goes to polls, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh reached Dadri’s Bisara village, and urged voters to elect a party that has “sent a message to the world that India has become a strong nation”. “You saw how our soldiers entered Pakistan and succeeded in eliminating terrorists there… Not just that, India’s intention has never been that of expansion but if someone enters the country, India can do anything. Bharat kisi ko chedta nahi hai lekin bharat ko koi chede toh Bharat chodta bhi nahi hai (India doesn’t bother anyone, but if someone bothers India then they aren’t spared),” Singh said.

Stressing on the importance of the state in the country’s politics, Singh told the gathering, “The people of this area have decided to give Tejpal Nagar a large number of votes and send him to the UP Assembly…UP is the country’s biggest state and it is UP which decides the condition and direction of the country. I am saying this because you know that in India’s Parliament, if UP had not given 73 out of 80 seats to BJP and its allies and sent them to the Parliament, then maybe the BJP would not have received a clear majority in Parliament and Narendra bhai Modi might not have become India’s PM. This was UP’s miracle that in such huge numbers, MPs were elected and we formed our government at the Centre.”
Stating that there is a lot of debate on what the government has done after two and a half years, Singh claimed that be it the government under Modi or Atal Bihari Vajpayee, not a single minister has faced any corruption charge. In an effort to reach out to voters, Singh made a poll pitch by bringing up Uri attacks and demonetisation.

People of four villages in Maharashtra turned up in large numbers to share the grief of the families of four bravehearts from the state, who were among the 18 jawans martyred in the Uri terror attack. Sandip Somnath Thok (24) from Nashik district, Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati lost their lives in Sunday’s terror attack.
Bodies of three martyrs — Sandip Thok, Chandrakant Galande and Vikas Uike — were brought to Ojhar airport in Nashik district in an IAF plane from Srinagar, an official press release issued at Nashik said. Maharashtra ministers Dada Bhuse and Girish Mahajan paid tributes to the three martyrs by placing wreaths on their coffins at the airport. Army officers and government officials were also present. The bodies were later taken to the respective hometowns of the martyrs by road for the last rites, the release added. The body of the fourth martyr, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe from Yavatmal district, was being brought to Nagpur by air and will be taken to his native place by road.
Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government announced financial assistance of Rs 15 lakh each to the families of the martyrs from the state. Villagers of Jashi in Mann tehsil of Satara district made a beeline in front of Galande’s house ever since the news of his killing reached the village. Galande’s brothers Manjya Bapu and Keshav are also in the armed forces. The family has a house on the outskirts of the village where the slain soldier’s wife and two children live.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At Khandagali village in Nashik district, the family of Sandip Somnath Thok, killed in the Uri attack, was mourning the loss of the soldier who was a bachelor. Sandip is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters. His father Somnath is an onion farmer. Sandip had joined the army in 2014 after repeated attempts. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces.
Purad Nerad in Wani tehsil of Yavatmal district was mourning the death of Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe. Vikas, who joined the army in 2008 and was transferred to the camp at Uri six months ago, had got married two years back. He is survived by wife Sneha (23), a four-month-old daughter, a younger brother and parents. Vikas Janrao Uike from Nandgaon Khandeshwar town in Amravati district, who joined the Bihar Battalion of the army

at Chandrapur in 2009, had served at Assam and West Bengal, before being posted at Jammu and Kashmir three months ago. He left behind parents, a brother and a married sister. His father Janrao said they were planning to marry him off soon.
“We had planned to solemnise the engagement on Diwali but all our plans have been shattered,” he told PTI. The grief-stricken residents of Nandgaon Khandeshwar town observed a spontaneous bandh on Monday."

Faced with a barrage of criticism from various quarters over his statements on cross-LoC strikes by the Army, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Sunday said he has stopped using the word “strike”. The minister had faced flak from the Opposition for a flurry of remarks over the surgical strikes carried out by the Army in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in September. “I will prefer to address the gathering in local language. I hardly get an opportunity to address in local language. But I promise you I will not touch any controversial issue. I have already stopped using the word strike,” Parrikar, who was in his home state of Goa, said during the inauguration of a helicopter engines maintenance unit in Sattari tehsil.

“You brought the term (strike) in your speech referring to labour issues,” he said on a lighter note after the speech by Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar during the event. On October 17, Parrikar had appeared to give credit to “RSS teaching” for the decision to launch cross-LoC surgical strikes even as he slammed those seeking proof for the Army’s anti-terror operation.
The minister had also trashed claims of such operations under the UPA, provoking a counter offensive from the Congress, which accused him of “blatant politicisation” of the issue. Condemning Parrikar for rejecting its claim of surgical strikes having been undertaken by the Army under UPA, Congress had demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi tame his “belligerent” minister and BJP chief Amit Shah, and apologise to the armed forces.
The surgical strikes were carried out on seven terror launch pads across the LoC with the Army inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK. The strikes on the intervening night of September 28 and 29 came days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that the Uri attack, which left 19 Indian soldiers dead, would not go unpunished."

BJP leader and MP Narendra Sawaikar on Sunday said the Uri terror attack is an attempt to distract the Central government which is marching forward. “Incidents like the Pathankot (attack) and today’s (Uri attack) is nothing but an attempt to distract the Central government which is marching forward,” the Lok Sabha member, who represents South Goa, told reporters in Panaji.
He said attempts in the form of terror attack are planned to ensure the country doesn’t become a super power. “Through such an attempt, militants are trying to weaken the country,” added Sawaikar.
Uri, a small town located 103 kms north of Srinagar, woke up to heavy gunfire when four terrorists, suspected to be of Jaish-e-Mohammed group, entered the rear office of the infantry battalion of 10 Dogra regiment and killed 17 soldiers. All the four terrorists were eliminated. In January, seven military personnel were killed when terrorists had attacked the Pathankot air base."

Supporting India’s “right to self-defence” in the aftermath of the Uri attack which it dubbed a “clear case of cross-border terrorism”, the US dismissed the recent attempt by Pakistan to link peace in war-torn Afghanistan with resolution of the Kashmir issue. The White House backed India’s right to defend itself as with any other country, in view of the recent surgical strike but advised caution given the heavy militarisation between the two neighbours.

It also said that that the US is making every effort to ensure that India become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) by the end of this year.
Making a rare appearance before a Washington audience, Peter Lavoy, the White House’s point person for South Asia, said that India-US ties are the “most dynamic relationship” for the US as he listed the Obama administration’s achievements in strengthening the relationship between the two largest democracies of the world.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It (Uri) was a clear case of cross-border terrorism. We condemned this act of terrorism. It was a horrific attack. Every country has a right to self defence. But in a heavily militarised relationship that has also experienced three wars, there is indeed a need for caution and restraint,” he said responding to a question on the Uri attack.

“We share with India, the concern for preventing any future attack. We empathise with the Indian position that it needs to respond militarily to cross-border threat of terrorism. But we also advise caution,” Lavoy said.
India and Pakistan have a “friction-filled relationship” and they have not found a way to overcome that, he said.
Last week, Lavoy met the two special envoys of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Kashmir.
The two Pakistani envoys in their public meetings had linked peace in Afghanistan to resolving the Kashmir issue.
“We certainly do not believe that the situation in Afghanistan is linked with Kashmir,” the top White House official said.
Lavoy said the US is making every effort to ensure that India becomes a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group by the end of this year.

Ia a second incident of ceasefire violation along the Line of Control in Poonch district during the current month, Pakistani troops on Wednesday resorted to unprovoked firing on forward Indian positions at Sawjian.
Pointing out that the firing from across the border began around 6 pm, sources said that Pakistani troops were using small arms and mortar shells. Today’s firing has come in the district after 22 days. Earlier, they had targeted Indian positions Shahpur area on September 6.
The Indian troops were also retaliating. However, there were no reports of any loss or damage on the Indian side.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has since upped the offensive against Pakistan, with the strongest signal coming on Tuesday, when India announced it will not attend the 19th SAARC summit in Islamabad in November.
PM Modi has also called a meeting, to decide upon the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status accorded to the country in 1996, on September 29 which will be attended by top officials of the Ministry of External Affairs and Commerce Ministry.

A day after 17 Army personnel were killed in one of the worst terror attacks on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir, celebrities and stars in India continue to condemn the attack in Uri. Four heavily armed terrorists sneaked into the administrative buildings and store complex of an infantry battalion in Uri, home of the 12 Infantry Brigade, near the Line of Control (LoC). Apart from the 17 dead, 20 others were injured.
Virat Kohli, India Test captain, has also raised his voice against the terror attack and said that images from Uri ‘fill him up with emotions he can’t explain’. He also paid his respect to the martyrs. The cricketer tweeted a picture of the attack site in Uri with smoke cover the whole site.
The four terrorists, who attacked at 4am on Sunday, were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar made several contrasting statements on the issue of surgical strikes on Wednesday. Parrikar said that the current government is the first one to carry out surgical strikes and there have not been any surgical strikes in the past. His raked up the issue after PM Modi refrained from speaking on it a day earlier during his Dussehra address. Ever since PM Modi decided to attend the Dussehra event in Lucknow, there were speculations that he will use the occasion to speak about the surgical strikes. There were posters of him with Rajnath Singh outside the Aishbagh ground calling them ‘avengers of Uri.’ PM Modi, however, abstained from speaking on the matter, perhaps, in a bid to refrain from politicising the issue. However, Parrikar’s statement made sure the issue remains alive in electoral discourse during the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh.

Speaking on the same day, Parrikar first stated that he would take part credit but the credit goes to PM Modi for his decisive action and the army. Then he changed his statement saying the credit entirely goes to Army and 127 crore people of the country and that “we (Parrikar, Modi and the govt) don’t take credit for the operations”.
“I don’t mind sharing credits, including the surgical strikes, with every countryman because it is done by our Armed Forces and not by any political party. I will only share the credit at the most… the major share goes to the Prime Minister but the issue I will at least claim the credit (for) is decision making ability and planning,” Parrikar said while speaking at the MET 2016 (Materials Engineering Technology) conference in Mumbai.

He later added, “To all the doubting Thomases, I would like to say that the credit for the surgical strikes goes to all the 127 crore Indians, and not to any political party. It was the Army which carried out the surgical strikes and perhaps a little credit for decision making (to allow it) can go to our Prime Minister and me.”
Parrikar then said that “to my knowledge there were no surgical strikes carried in the past. Those action can at the best be called as ‘covert operations’ where the action was taken first and the Government was informed later. But the 29 September strikes were a result of a government decision.”
Parrikar has come under heavy fire from the Opposition in recent days who have even gone to term him unfit to be Defence Minister. The Opposition alleged that the minister has wrongly claimed credit for the Army’s operation.
India carried out surgical strikes on terror launchpads in PoK on September 29 after an Army encampment was attacked by Pakistani terrorists at Uri near the Brigade HQ on September 18. Nineteen soldiers were killed in the Uri attack. Indian armed forces have carried out covert ops and cross-border attacks in the past in Pakistan to hit adversaries including terrorists. But, this is the first time that an Indian government has come out taking responsibility for conducting surgical strikes.
In recent days, Opposition leaders have gone after Parrikar and the prime minister, seeking evidence of the operations. Senior leaders of previous regime like P Chidambaram and Salman Khurshid and even former NSA Shiv Shankar Menon – who served during the tenure of former PM Manmohan Singh – have been quoted in several reports saying UPA government carried out surgical strikes in the past as well but they didn’t claim responsibility of those attacks neither did they make it public as their target was not to gain political brownie points."

The tourist footfall at Border Out Post (BoP) along the International Border in Suchetgarh has been badly affected following the September 29 surgical strike at terror camps across the LoC. Touted to become one of the main tourist attractions in the Jammu region, the border outpost (BOP) on the IB has turned into a less tourist-friendly place with operational preparedness along the borders in Jammu and Kashmir, amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. The BOP, which was to be developed on the pattern of Wagah border in Punjab was a mission taken up by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti herself.
“Post the surgical strike on terrorist launch pads, there has been sharp decline in the number of tourists who come to visit the border outpost. Even those who come are not allowed to go near the border as we fear that Pakistan side might resort to some mischievous activity,” said a BSF official deployed at the Octerio BOP. The border tourism was launched this year on July 3 amid much fanfare as tourists made a beeline at Octeroi Border Outpost along the IB with Pakistan which has three-tier border fencing.
“Prior to the Uri terrorist attack on September 18, there was a huge rush of tourists who came to visit the border and have a firsthand feel of the life of BSF Jawans guarding the border, but the number dwindled post the Uri attack and since the surge in the hostilities post the surgical strikes, tourists have almost stopped coming here,” the official said. The border posts were opened for tourists from 8 AM to 6 PM daily.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Yes that is true that there is sharp decline of number of people visiting the border areas. Certainly some people will choose to avoid the visit till they feel it is absolutely safe to go,” Deputy Commissioner (DC) Jammu, Simrandeep Singh told PTI.
“People living along the border belt of the R S Pura sector were also elated to know that the inflow of tourists to the belt would help improve their economy, but the recent escalation has shattered their dreams. We have seen the worst of times, when prior to the 2003 ceasefire between the two nations, we were not able to move out as mortars fired from across the border used to land on our houses. Things improved after 2003 but then, there were again sporadic incidents of ceasefire violations, but this time we fear for the worst,” Shaadi Lal, a local resident of Suchetgarh said.
Pakistani troops have violated ceasefire on Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir for 11,270 times since 2002, claiming the lives of 313 people including 144 security personnel, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had told the J&K Assembly recently."

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Monday gave sanctions to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to prosecute Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and three others in connection with the Indian Air Force base terror attack in Pathankot, Punjab. Besides January 2nd Pathankot attack, Azhar is also wanted for the Uri attack which was carried out by suspected JeM terrorists on September 18th, in which 19 defence personnel were killed.
India has been continuously making efforts to get the UN Sanctions Committee to Azhar and had submitted a dossier listing out his terror activities since 1993, which specifically mentioned him as one of the handlers of the Pathankot terrorists.
However, India has been facing a hurdle in the matter as China has collaborated with Pakistan to block New Delhi’s proposal to ban Masood Azhar. Following the attack on the Indian Air Force Base in Pathankot killing seven Indian military personnel, India called on the United Nations for immediate action to list Azhar under the al-Qaida Sanctions Committee.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to reports, 14 out of 15 countries were willing to designate Azhar but China alone decided to go against all the others in the bid. The US, UK and France had strongly supported the move and the other nations had also expressed their consent to proceed with the action on Azhar.
But China, one of the five permanent members of the UN group with veto powers, collaborated with Pakistan to block the bid, sources add. China is now the only country that has stood up for Masood Azhar more than once."

(Source: PTI)
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday shrugged off new US threats to retaliate against alleged Russian hackers, saying such statements only confirmed that Washington used cyber attacks for political ends. Speaking after a summit of developing economies in India Putin also said he believed that the hacking allegations were mainly election campaign rhetoric by the White House, and that he hoped bilateral ties could improve after the US elections.

US Vice President Joe Biden told NBC News television on Friday that “we are sending a message” to Putin, and that retaliation for Russia’s hacking attacks “will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact”. The US government this month formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the November 8 presidential election.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“You can expect anything from our American friends. But what did he say that was new? Don’t we know that official bodies of the United States are spying and eavesdropping on everyone?” Putin told reporters after the summit of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
“The only new thing is that for the first time the United States has recognised at the highest level … that they themselves do it (cyber attacks).” Putin said that by “playing the Russian card” in the current election campaign, the outgoing US administration sought to distract voter attention from its failures, which include huge state debt, weak diplomacy in the Middle East and strained relations with its allies in that region.
“I would like to reassure everyone, including our US partners and friends – we do not intend to influence the US election campaign,” he said. Putin said he would work with any US leader willing to work with Russia.
“If someone wants confrontation, this is not our choice,” he said. “On the contrary, we would like to find common ground and cooperate in solving the global problems that confront both Russia and the United States.”
On Thursday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused the Obama administration of destroying bilateral relations in the run-up to the elections, saying that “the level of Russophobic propaganda coming from the very top is now starting to go off the scale”."

(PTI Photo)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a strong attack on Pakistan on Saturday, warning that India will not forget the sacrifices of the 18 soldiers who were killed in the terrorist strike at the Army camp in Uri last Sunday.
At the same time, he reached out to the people of Pakistan — differentiating between them and their government, which he said was the sole exporter of terror across the globe. Modi spoke directly to Pakistanis, telling them to ask their rulers why, at a time India was exporting software to the entire world, Pakistan was bent on exporting terrorism.

The Prime Minister acknowledged the nationwide “aakrosh” in the wake of Uri, but framed the conflict in terms of a long haul — reminding both his audience and Pakistan that while India would not forget the loss of 18 jawans, Indian forces had killed over 110 terrorists while foiling 17 attempted attacks, the most in recent years.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The confidence and faith of 1.25 billion Indians was what fired the soldier and gave him strength, the PM said.
Modi challenged Pakistan to go to war against poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and infant mortality instead, saying “let’s see who wins those wars”, India or Pakistan. “I want to say that India is a ready for a war… India is a ready for a war on poverty. Let both countries fight to see who would eradicate poverty first… I want to tell the youth of Pakistan, let’s have a war on ending unemployment… I want to call out to the children in Pakistan, let’s declare war on illiteracy. Let’s see who wins. Let’s declare war on infant mortality and maternal deaths,” he said.

Modi’s first public speech since the Uri attacks, at Kozhikode beach at the beginning of the BJP’s National Council meeting, struck a balance between responding to belligerent sections within his support base who have been seeking visible action against Pakistan, and positioning the PM as the statesman who saw the India Story as being bigger and brighter than the India-Pak tensions story.
At the same time, he repeatedly praised the armed forces, lauding their sacrifice and boosting their morale.
“Sacrifice of our 18 jawans will not go in vain,” he said. “Let the terrorists make no mistake, India will never forget the Uri attack… We will leave no stone unturned to isolate Pakistan in the world.”

“India never has, and never will, bow to terror, it will defeat terror,” he declared. “Our soldiers have defended the country, fighting and protecting the citizens, we are proud of their sacrifces.”
“There is one nation in Asia whose aim is to ensure that the 21st century does not become Asia’s century, and that it remains associated with terrorism,” Modi said, referring to Pakistan. “This one country exports terrorism to other countries. That country wants South Asia’s history to be splattered with blood, killings and terror… Whenever a terror attack takes place, only one country is blamed. Whenever we hear about terror strikes, news follows that either the terrorist went from there or, like Osama bin Laden, they settled there afterward.”

The PM, who referred to human rights violations in Balochistan in his Independence Day speech, returned to the theme on Saturday. “I want to address the people of Pakistan today,” he said. “Your rulers are misleading you by singing songs on Kashmir and reading out scripts written by terrorists on Kashmir. You should ask your leaders why India, which was created along with Pakistan, exports software and Pakistan exports terror… You should ask them why they were not able to handle East Pakistan, and why they cannot handle PoK, Gilgit, Sindh, Balochistan and Pakhunistan…?”
A day would come, the Prime Minister said, when the people of Pakistan will go against its own country to fight against terrorism. New Delhi, Modi said, would continue to expose Pakistan.

“There are two Indias,” said the anchor on Tuesday evening — one that stands in “solidarity” against terrorism; the other which spreads “fear” and “mistrust” (Republic). Which India do you choose?
On the one hand, there was the India represented by a composed Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh who, on Tuesday, lauded Kashmiris for condemning the terrorist attack on a bus of Amarnath yatris with a “salute” and said he believed in “Kashmiriyat”. On the other hand, there was Major General G. D. Bakshi, red-faced and swollen with anger and outrage over alleged inaction: “Kaam keejiye… (those responsible for the attack) should be hunted down in two or three days”.
On the one hand, leaders across the political spectrum, on TV news, denounced the terrorist attack and offered condolences to the families of the bereaved — Rajnath Singh, other Union ministers, J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, NC leader Omar Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad (Congress), Lalu Prasad (RJD), etc. In the headlines, condemnations and sympathy from President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

(TMC) indicated that “India stands united” (Republic).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On the other hand, News X, Zee News, Times Now and Republic went after what the latter in its promo called, “bleeding hearts”, “Pak terror proxies”. Times Now claimed, “The Opposition won’t take a stand. Even now RaGa and Co appease…” In the evening, it flashed photos of Omar Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad, suggesting their condemnations were mere lip service. News X derided “Netas (who) bicker”, asked them to “Put India First. Show maturity” and proclaimed, “What a time for politics!”.
But who was playing politics here — the politicians or the news channels? Why did there seem to be a determination to divide even when everyone across the board united against terror?
Zee News and Zee Hindustan talked of the blame game and wanted immediate retaliation: “Desh maange jawab”, “Badla lo” — something that was echoed by families of those bereaved. But they also had questions. In Mumbai, Nirmala’s family was in tears. Her husband wondered why no one was there to help the people in the bus; a female relative wailed — what kind of security was in place? (Zee Hindustan).
India Today said that there were “serious deviations” by the bus from the norms set out for yatri buses. News 9 wondered if there had been a security lapse while News X asked BJP’s Ram Madhav, in charge of party affairs in Kashmir how, in spite of intelligence alerts, could such an attack take place? Legitimate questions. And the same questions were raised by some opposition leaders who were promptly accused of playing politics by the channels mentioned above. Do you think that perhaps some news channels suffer from selective hearing? Whether or not they do, some certainly appear to practise selective questioning. It is by no means anyone’s case that politicians should not be cross-questioned; by all means ask questions but ask them of all politicians. And should questions be put to those who govern and are therefore, in a position to take decisions or should questions be asked of politicians out of power? What is more in the public interest?
If there was one thing all news channels agreed upon, however, it was Salim Sheikh, the driver of the ill-fated bus who continued to drive through the welter of bullet shots — he was hailed as a hero, or in the words of CNN News 18, “India salutes Salim”.
There couldn’t have been a channel which didn’t interview him and herald his courage under fire.
For the rest, the coverage was more sober than it was when the Uri attack took place last autumn or even during the recent lynching of police officer Mohammed Ayub Pandit. Monday night, the terrorist attack took precedence over the bickering on channel debates and through Tuesday morning, the coverage was about developments on the ground — news more than views.
Lastly, a word about DD Sports coverage of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships. Poor. The commentary was often not professional: Commentators didn’t always know who had won, got the names of the winners wrong — Lili Das instead of Archana Adhav in the 800 metres (she was disqualified later), for instance. The cameras could not capture all angles of the track so you could only follow the leaders and the studio chit chat was idle: “As you see people are pouring into the stadium,” said one presenter when you could clearly see the almost completely empty stands behind him."

The junior hockey World Cup is less than a month away but Pakistan’s participation is still doubtful. International Hockey Federation’s (FIH) newly-appointed president Narinder Batra insisted that they have received a confirmation from the Pakistani board even though he said they have kept a couple of teams on standby.
However, Shahbaz Ahmed, the secretary of Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), said they are yet to receive clearance from their government to travel to Lucknow for the 16-team event. Owing to security concerns following the conflict at the Line of Control, the PHF had sought permission from the Pakistan government last month.
Ahmed said they expect a reply ‘within a week’ even as they began their visa procedure on Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It generally takes time to get such clearances. Because of the prevailing political situation, we needed our government to okay it. We expect our government to reply soon,” Ahmed told The Indian Express.
The former Pakistan captain said they had initially requested the FIH to keep their matches at a neutral venue.
However, they are not considering that option anymore. “It is too late to move matches to a neutral venue now. A month ago, we did discuss it but not anymore,” he said.
The last time a Pakistani side in any sport travelled to India was in December 2014, when the hockey team took part in the Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar. Their kabaddi team pulled out of the world cup in October due to security fears following a series of protests against Pakistani nationals by political groups after the Uri attacks.
Batra said the FIH has ‘two or three’ teams has back up to replace Pakistan, but was confident that they will not pull out. “As far as FIH is concerned, Pakistan has confirmed its participation. But eventually the choice is with the governments of both India and Pakistan. In every FIH tournament, we always keep back ups ready in place. In case Pakistan doesn’t turn up, we have two-three teams in line to replace them,” Batra, who became the first Asian to become the FIH president last Saturday, said.
If they are given the go ahead by the Pakistan government, Ahmed said they will not send a team to review security arrangements in Lucknow. “Since it is an international tournament, we will leave the security aspect to the organisers,” Ahmed said.
Batra said Pakistan’s security and other logistics will be arranged only after they get the schedule and route of their arrival.
JSW bag HIL franchise
Meanwhile, the Hockey India League will have a seventh team from the 2018 edition onwards. Batra said Jindal Steel have acquired the Bangalore franchise but they have chosen to skip the 2017 season. JSW also own I-League side Bengaluru FC and Bengaluru Yodhas in the Pro Wrestling League.
“Initially, the plan was to introduce them in 2017 but Indian players were not available. They wanted to be competitive so it was better to wait for a year,” he said, adding that India will host the 2018 Asian Champions Trophy along with the World Cup in Bhubaneswar.
Meanwhile, Batra said he will quit other positions in hockey to avoid conflict of interest with his new role as the FIH chief. Currently, he is the president of Hockey India and Hockey Jammu Kashmir, vice president of Asian Hockey Federation, chairman of Hockey India League and associate vice president of the Indian Olympic Association.
“I am not aware of the rules regarding my position in the IOA but I will quit from the other three posts. New Hockey India president will be chosen as per our constitution within the next one month,” he said."

India and Pakistan need to engage in dialogue which is the best way to defeat extremism and to improve strained ties, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry has said. Pakistan believes that dialogue with India is the best way to defeat extremism which is damaging bilateral relations between the countries, Chaudhry said on Tuesday.

“Relations between Pakistan and India have not been very good and the reason is that Pakistan and India are not having any dialogue, there is also misperception about each other. This is not something that our leadership wants…” he was quoted by Russian news agency Sputnik as telling a press conference.
“We also believe that it is for the our two countries to sit at the table and share each other perspectives, no matter how difficult the issues are, including extremism that damages the bilateral relations,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His remarks come amid severe chill in Indo-Pak ties after Pakistan-based terrorists attacked an Indian army base in Uri in September.
The recent exchange of fire on the Line of Control (LoC) may lead to “strategic miscalculations,” making the role of the UN Monitoring Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) crucial to regional peace and stability, he said.
India, however, does not recognise the UNMOGIP and has maintained that the group has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the LoC. India has always stated that it has “no role to play whatsoever”.
Chaudhry also said Pakistan, which currently holds the observer status at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and would become a fully-fledged member next year, does not view it as a platform to discuss its bilateral issues with India.
He also expressed hope that India would abide by its obligations under the Indus Water Treaty, saying New Delhi will start a “dangerous precedent” if it violates the landmark water-sharing accord it signed with Pakistan in 1960.
“Contravention of the treaty or its unilateral abrogation by India will not only violate Indus Water Treaty but also set a precedent providing other countries a possible justification to undertake similar actions,” he told Sputnik, amid reports India reviewed the treaty following the Uri attack."

International Film Festival of India, a government entity, is making sure it is remembered more for the films it has pulled out than the content it will finally screen. Days after two regional films, Nude and S Durga were dropped from the Goa festival, it has been reported that acclaimed Pakistani feature, Saawan has been pulled out from the programme too.
Saawan is Pakistan’s entry to Oscars 2018 in the Best Foreign Film category. It was supposed to be screened at 48th edition of IFFI in the Cinema of the World section, but is no more a part of the slate. Its director Farhan Alam expressed his disappointment in an email interview to The Hindu.
Alam said that on October 26, he received an official letter from Festival Director Sunit Tandon stating that the festival was honoured to present the film in the Cinema of the World section. The letter invited Alam to present the film at the festival and interact with the audience.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I was excited to take part in the festival and share my film with an Indian audience. It would have been an honour for me to share my work and I was hoping to meet filmmakers from India as well as around the world,” the publication quoted him as saying.
In an e-mail dated November 4, senior programmer Deepika Suseelan, however, informed the director that the film could not be screened. It said that because of “scheduling constraints” they were unable to showcase some of the films originally planned. “It was very disappointing and heartbreaking for me to hear this news as I was looking forward to attend this festival,” said the filmmaker.
Based on the true story of a polio-stricken child, who faced difficulties in the deserts of Pakistan, Saawan released in its home country in September. It has won accolades at various international festivals. It is supposed to be screened at an Indian film festival, the third edition of All Lights Indian International Film Festival, which is scheduled for December 1-4. The suspense drama stars Saleem Mairaj, Syed Karam Abbas, Arif Bahalim, Najiba Faiz and Imran Aslam in the lead roles.

Last year, Jio MAMI 18th Mumbai Film Festival dropped Pakistani feature Jago Hua Savera as part of the Restored Classics Section after receiving threats from Mumbai-based organisation Sangharsh’s complaints and threats. The Sangharsh’s stand followed the directives issued by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) and the Cinema Exhibitors Association against Pakistani talent in Indian films in the wake of the Uri attack.
Interestingly, Jago Hua Savera was also Pakistan’s entry to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Film category in the year 1959."

Two months ago when Sushma Swaraj said goodbye to the Ministry of External Affairs, people were sad to see their ‘favourite minister’ go, and it might explain the shock over her sudden demise Tuesday. Within months of taking charge in 2014, Swaraj made sure that the ministry was a responsive government institution. A system, thus, was put in place where she would respond to distress tweets from Indians stranded across the world.
From reuniting families to helping citizens recover their passports and travel home from war-torn countries, every request for help – whether small or big – was seen and responded to by Swaraj. On more than one occasion her witty tweets and replies to stranger requests went viral.
Here are some notable instances where Swaraj used the microblogging platform to provide aid to people:https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
With Sushma Swaraj’s help, Pakistani infant arrives in India for treatment
Swaraj made sure she was available to help people in need of medical treatment, even if ties between India and Pakistan weren’t very cordial. She won hearts online across the border after helping four-month-old Pakistani infant, Rohaan, who was in need of urgent medical attention for a heart ailment.
The minister, responding to Rohaan’s father Kanwal Saadik’s appeal for help, granted a medical visa to the child despite restrictions on the same.

No. The child will not suffer. Pls contact Indian High Commission in Pakistan. We will give the medical visa. pic.twitter.com/4ADWkFV6Ht https://t.co/OLVO3OiYMB

Swaraj—who had torn into Pakistan in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly—in her response to the girl showed the bitterness between the two nations didn’t need to come in the way of humanitarian action. “Aliya – I was concerned about your well being kyonki betiyan to sabki sanjhi hoti hain” (I was concerned about your well being because one’s daughter is everyone’s daughter).

With time running out, Tewani sought Swaraj’s help and said she was his last hope.

Swaraj helps woman mugged in Tanzania despite no request
Charanya Kannan, a woman from Chennai who was studying at the Harvard Business School, had a very bad experience when she visited Tanzania for a course on public-private partnerships. The woman, who was there for two weeks with 39 others, was mugged by a biker in her second week in Dar Es Salaam, and lost her passport, phones, cash and credit cards.
Initially, she sought the assistance of an official at Indian Embassy in Tanzania, who told her nothing could be done. She shared the entire experience on a blog and Swaraj read it. The minister asked the woman to name the officer at the Indian High Commission, who had refused to help her.

The Indian army struck along a giant arc on the Line of Control early this morning, staging what it described as “surgical strikes” on terrorist launch-pads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh, India’s Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO), said the strikes, which took place “along the Line of Control” caused “significant damage” but offered no further details.
WATCH VIDEO:

In military textbooks, a “surgical strike” refers to an attack that causes damage to its intended target not to a mode of assault. Pakistan’s military said that two of its soldiers were killed when troops “exchanged fire across the Line of Control” in an engagement which began at 2:30 a.m. and ended at 8:00a.m. In a later statement, it denied any strikes had taken place across the Line of Control (LoC), claiming instead that there had been “cross-border fire initiated and conducted by India which is an ‘existential phenomenon’’.

General Singh’s statement left open the possibility that India may have used artillery or anti-tank missiles to precision-target terrorist launching positions without risking troops in a mission across the Line of Control.
Kel and Lipa are both known to be significant launching stations for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and other terrorist groups where small units of jihadists gather near military forward posts for the last stage of their journey across the LoC into northern Kashmir. Bhimber, similarly, is a major axis of infiltration into Rajouri and Poonch.
READ | Uri Attack: India hits Pakistan terror launchpads in surgical strikes along LoC
India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire along the Line of Control in 2003, following the India-Pakistan military crisis that followed the Jaish-e-Muhammad’s attack on Parliament House on December 13, 2001. However, efforts to arrive at a formal signed agreement stalled in 2006, following disputes over the rules governing new defensive fortifications.

Ever since the long jihad in Kashmir began in 1989, troops on both sides of the LoC have been locked in an often-savage secret war which General Singh’s press conference has for the first time brought out into the open. History suggests that the fighting on Thursday is unlikely to mark the end of the story.

While 2016 has been the most peaceful year on the LoC in a decade, the ceasefire had been fraying steadily since Lance-Naik Hem Raj and Lance-Naik Sudhakar Naik were beheaded in a jihadist strike in January 2013, amidst a surge in infiltration backed by the Pakistan Army.
WATCH VIDEO:

The fighting that began in 2013 had its genesis in events of October 2012 when Pakistan complained of new Indian border work at Charunda in Uri. India responded that the work were purely defensive, intended to prevent illegal border crossings. The unresolved dispute led to exchanges of fire, which eventually escalated into shelling and the killings of soldiers on both sides. Late in July 2013, Pakistan complained that “unprovoked” Indian fire had led to the death of Sepoy Asim Iqbal in the Nazia Peer sector near the town of Rawlakote. India, however, said the firing began in response to an infiltration attempt."

(Source: PTI Photo/Twitter)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the surgical strikes carried out across the LoC proved that India would not hesitate to take the toughest measures to defend itself, while noting that no country in the world had questioned it — an apparent swipe at Pakistan. Addressing Indian-Americans at a reception in Virginia, Modi asserted that India has been successful in convincing the world about “the face of terrorism that is destroying peace and normal life” in the country. “When we talked of terrorism 20 years back, many in the world said it was a law and order problem and didn’t understand it. Now terrorists have explained terrorism to them so we don’t have to,” he said.

Modi said the surgical strikes demonstrated that India, which normally follows the principle of restraint, can also defend its sovereignty and ensure its security when needed. “When India carried out the surgical strikes, the world realised the our strength and saw that while we exercise restraint, when the need arises, India can also show its strength and might in dealing with terror and protecting itself,” he said to thunderous applause from the diaspora.

India conducted surgical strikes on terror pads across the Line of Control on September 29 last year, 11 days after the Uri attack which claimed the lives of 19 Indian soldiers. The Prime Minister said that the world could have put India in the dock for carrying out the attack accoss the LoC. “But for the first time not one nation in the world raised a single question, about India’s major step to conduct the surgical strikes against terror camps on Pakistani soil.” “It is a different matter for those who had to suffer due to the surgical strikes,” Modi said, taking another jibe at Pakistan, amid laughter from the audience.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister had some choice barbs for China as well, saying India does not believe in disturbing the global order to achieve its goals. “This is India’s tradition and culture,” he noted, apparently referring to China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea.
“We are bound by international law because that is our character and nature. For us the concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — the world is one family — are not just words. This is our nature and character,” he said. The Prime Minister said India, while following international laws and norms, is also capable of taking the “toughest of steps for our sovereignty, security, peace, our people and progress”. “Whenever the need arises we have done it and the world will never be able to stop us,” he said."

Shiv Sena on Saturday came out in support of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is under attack from BJP for drawing a comparison between the Uri terror attack casualties and the deaths after demonetisation, saying an apology by him for the comments will not change the truth. BJP has sought an apology from Azad, the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, for his remarks but he has rejected the demand.

“Will the truth change if Azad apologises?” asked an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
“In the Uri attack, 20 jawans were martyred. Due to the demonetisation, 40 brave patriots have lost their lives (while standing in queues at banks to exchange demonetised notes).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The difference is in the attackers. Pakistan attacked us in Uri, where in the case of demonetisation (deaths) it was our own rulers,” Sena, a partner of the BJP-led alliance at the Centre, said.
“Even if the number of deaths caused by inflation, recession and unemployment rises from 40 to 40 lakh, this government will say they are victims of patriotism.
“We only hope that going by this rate, a time will come wherein we have to declare the entire country as a martyr,” Sena said.
Parliament was stalled for the last two days due to ruckus caused by charges and counter charges by the ruling NDA and Opposition over demonetisation.
Sena has been unrelenting in its attack on the Centre over demonetisation and had even joined hands with some opposition parties in demonstrations in Delhi over the issue.
Two days back, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and is believed to have conveyed BJP’s unhappiness over NDA ally participating in a march against demonestisation even as the Sena stuck to its criticism, saying it could have been implemented in a better way."

Against the backdrop of Uri attack emanating from Pakistan, a Japanese Parliamentary delegation today welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for greater international cooperation against terrorism and for coordinated efforts to isolate the countries sponsoring terrorism.
The Japanese MPs conveyed this to the Prime Minister when they met him here as part of Japan-India Parliamentarians’ Friendship League (JIPFL).

“The JIPFL delegation conveyed their condolences for the victims of the cross-border terror attack in Uri…,” a PMO statement said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The JIPFL delegation welcomed PM’s call for greater international cooperation against the global menace of terrorism, and for coordinated efforts to isolate the State sponsors of terrorism,” the statement added.
This comes against the backdrop of the terror attack on army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18. Convinced that the attack emanated from Pakistan, India is weighing options for counter action, which includes efforts to isolate that country.
During the meeting, Modi recalled his successful visit to Japan in 2014 where he had interacted with JIPFL in Tokyo.
He said that India and Japan have laid the foundations for strong cooperation in many areas for decades to come.
The JIPFL delegation said there is strong bipartisan support in Japan for strengthening relations with India and welcomed the progress achieved in High Technology cooperation, especially in High Speed Railway, the statement said.
Modi recalled that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to India last year was a landmark in the history of bilateral relations and that he is looking forward to visiting Japan in the near future."

Fawad Khan who is currently in the eye of a political storm in India courtesy MNS is currently in Pakistan and may in all probability remain there for a good long period. The actor is attending to his wife Sadaf who is pregnant with their second child. Given the troubled political atmosphere prevailing in India, it is unlikely that the actor will return to India anytime soon.
Says a source, “Fawad was last in India in July. After finishing his professional commitment he returned to Pakistan. He is currently on a paternity break, attending his wife who is pregnant and in her final trimester. Their second child is due in October and he will be spending time with his wife for the moment.”

The actor, who will next be seen in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in which he has an extended special appearance, will in all probability skip the promotional activities that had initially been planned. Says a source close to the production house, “Karan Johar had planned the promotional activity of his movie by drawing in Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Fawad Khan. The actor was supposed to join in for a week’s time before flying back to be with his wife. But given the political call for his ban, it looks impossible. In any case, there was little window available to have Fawad in Mumbai because his wife is expecting their second child.”
While Fawad’s absence may affect the ADHM’s promotional activities, Karan currently must be more concerned about MNS remaining tough on their decision to stall his movie unless Fawad’s scenes are deleted. The party upped the ante today by staging a protest outside his office and home demanding the withdrawal of Pakistani actors and deletion of their scenes from his movie.

MNS has threatened to block the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil which has him in an extended guest appearance.
 
MNS had issued a 48-hour ultimatum on Friday to all actors from across the border to leave India in the wake of Uri attacks. Fawad is playing a guest role in Karan Johar’s upcoming film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

Eighteen soldiers were killed in the Uri terror attack. In the wake of the attack, MNS had demanded that all Pakistani actors should leave India by September 25. Fawad was threatened directly by the Raj Thackeray-led outfit. “When our soldiers are being killed on the borders by Pakistan, why should we host their actors here? We warn all Pakistani actors to leave India in the next 48 hours. If they do not do so, MNS activists will give them a thrashing,” Ameya Khopkar, president of the MNS Chitrapat Karmachari Sena, had said.

Shalini Thackeray, General Secretary of MNS Chitrapat Karamchari Sena, had said, “It is not a veiled threat. It’s a direct threat to producers like Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar who take Pakistani actors in their movies. Can’t you find Indian actors for your films? In this 125 crores Indian population, can’t you find a single Indian actor to cast in your films that you import people from a place like Pakistan, a country with which we all are facing a problem? It’s not a veiled threat but a direct threat. We will not allow the release of these movies here.”
Days later, the director of the film, Karan had said about the threat, “I understand the anger and the anguish that surround us and I empathise, my heart bleeds for the lost lives. There is nothing that can justify this terrible feeling of terror. Then you are faced in a situation such as this (asking for ban on Pak artistes). If this was truly a solution, one would take it… But this is not a solution. I don’t believe it is. The larger forces have to come together and sort the situation and this cannot be banning talent or art,” he had said.

If my film is targeted because of this, it will make me exceptionally sad because my intent was to put out a product out of love and nothing else… I beseech everyone to look at it holistically and understand the situation, that there is a larger situation here and it has nothing to do with banning talent.

Besides Vansh(10), 42-year-old Ravi Paul is survived by his wife Geeta Rani and another son Sudansheesh (7) and 80-year-old mother. Because of Ravi Paul’s death, a pall of gloom has descended on his native Sarwa village in Ramgarh sub-sector of Samba district.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“My father used to call early in the morning. Yesterday(Sunday) he called us and we spoke in length on various issues. He asked me to concentrate on my studies so that I could fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor in the Indian Army,” said Vansh, a class 6th student.
When asked whether he was aware of what tragedy has befallen on the family, Vansh, carrying two plastic tricolours, said his father laid down his life for the sanctity of the national flag.

“Yes I know that my father laid down his life for this tricolour and I will fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor in the Army so as to avenge the killing of my father,” he said.
Ravi Paul’s two brothers have also served in the Army. In this sleepy Sarwa village of over 120 families, there are many who have donned the olive green uniform at one stage of their life.
“Majority of the people in our village are either serving in the Army or have served at one stage of their life. Out of six brothers, my three brothers were in Army and Ravi Paul was the youngest to join the Army,” said Joginder Lal Salotra, elder brother of Ravi Paul.
He described Ravi Paul as a very jolly and friendly person who used to mingle with everybody in the village.
“Whenever he used to come on leave, people used to meet him as he always narrated the stories about his tenure in the Army,” Lal said.
He said Ravi Paul used to make sure that he calls his family everyday.
Mohan Lal Salotra, another brother of the martyr soldier, said he has not only lost a younger brother but a friend who used to share every secret of life with him.
“I also served in the Army and after retirement I joined Defence Security Corps (DSE) and I am currently posted in Ludhiana. Though I was elder to Ravi, we were like good friends who used to talk each other daily.
“September 17 was the last time we spoke and yesterday when I tried to call him, the line could not go through. Later in the afternoon, somebody called me to inform that my brother has made the supreme sacrifice for the nation,” Mohan Lal said.
He said his brother wanted both of his sons to become doctors and join the Indian Army to serve the nation, “Now it is our duty to make sure that the dream of our brother is fulfilled”.
Since the news of the martyrdom of Ravi Paul spread, thousands of villagers and relatives started pouring in to the house of the martyr soldier to express their solidarity with the bereaved family."

WITH ALL the P-5 countries — the UN Security Council’s five permanent members — condemning the Uri attack, New Delhi is now working the phones to garner the support of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries. This is a key element of India’s diplomatic offensive, as Delhi tries to stitch together broad international support in its aim to isolate Pakistan.

So far, New Delhi’s diplomatic outreach in the last 48 hours has yielded statements from some of the major players in the OIC grouping — Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. Some of them like UAE and Bahrain have, in their statements, even supported any action by India to confront, eradicate and fight terrorism — at a time when Delhi is discussing a range of military, diplomatic, political and economic options to retaliate against Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Besides, three of India’s neighbours — Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Maldives — which are also OIC members, have already condemned the attack. In fact, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convey his condemnation and support to India in the fight against terrorism. All SAARC member countries, including Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, have also condemned the attack.
According to government sources, the OIC is the most critical international grouping which has been vocal on the Kashmir situation in the past and has been toeing Pakistan’s line on human rights violations over the last two months.
Government sources said the idea behind getting OIC members to condemn the attack is to portray Pakistan as the perpetrator and isolate it diplomatically. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Joint Secretary (in charge of Gulf region) Mridul Kumar and Joint Secretary (in charge of West Asia and North Africa) B Bala Bhaskar have been liaising with envoys from these countries, and the Indian missions have also reached out to the governments there.
Though the OIC members have not named Pakistan, Delhi is quite pleased with their formulation so far — barring a few nuances.
From India’s perspective, the most important statement among the OIC members has been from Saudi Arabia, which has conveyed its “strong condemnation and denunciation of the terrorist attack”. South Block is pleased that Saudi Arabia, which has been Pakistan’s benefactor for decades now, has come up with the statement.
The UAE, another supporter of Pakistan, has also “condemned” the attack and expressed “solidarity and support to all actions it (India) may take to confront and eradicate terrorism”.
Although Qatar, another key member of the OIC, has condemned the attack, it has called it a “criminal attack”, while reiterating its “stance rejecting violence and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”.
South Block officials pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited all these three countries in the last two years.
Bahrain, which has a strong Indian expatriate community, has also expressed “full support” to India in its “actions to counter terrorism, renewing the kingdom’s firm position against all forms of terrorism and calling for concerted efforts to eliminate it and cut off its funding”.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited the country last year and held a meeting of heads of Indian missions in the region there.
On Tuesday, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena also called up the PM to condemn the terror attack.
By evening, South Block officials pointed to the US State Department spokesperson’s comments on Secretary of State John Kerry’s meeting with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif — which was perceived as an endorsement of New Delhi’s position.
John Kirby, the US State Department spokesperson, said Kerry “reiterated the need for Pakistan to prevent all terrorists from using Pakistani territory as safe havens”. He said Sharif and Kerry “expressed strong concern with recent violence in Kashmir — particularly the army base attack — and the need for all sides to reduce tensions. Kerry also stressed the need for restraint in nuclear weapons programmes.
Apart from the P-5 countries — US, UK, France, Russia and China — countries like Germany, Japan, Canada, South Korea and Mauritius are among the countries which have condemned the attack so far.
“While External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be raising the pitch at the UNGA, Minister of State (External Affairs) M J Akbar will also be meeting senior officials and counterparts in New York. It will be an all-out diplomatic offensive,” said an official privy to South Block’s plans."

(File photo)
Congress president Rahul Gandhi Saturday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after a retired Lieutenant General, who oversaw operations when Indian troops carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control, contended that the “overhype” of the 2016 surgical strikes did not help and that “it is not good” when “military operations get politicised”.
Taking to Twitter, Gandhi, without naming PM Modi, said, “Mr 36 has absolutely no shame in using our military as a personal asset. He used the surgical strikes for political capital and the Rafale deal to increase Anil Ambani’s real capital by 30,000 Cr. ”

The Congress has been stepping up attack on the BJP-led central government over the controversy pertaining to the purchase of 36 French-manufactured aircraft. Gandhi’s ‘Mr 36’ jibe at Narendra Modi is an apparent reference to the 36 Rafale aircraft deal, which, he has alleged, favoured Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence as the partner for Dassault Aviation.
Moderating a discussion on the ‘Role of Cross-Border Operations and Surgical Strikes’ at the ongoing Military Literature Festival, D S Hooda, who was the Northern Army Commander in September 2016 when surgical strikes were carried out in the wake of the Uri attack, said Friday that there was an “attempt to keep a purely military operation in the political domain by selective leaks of videos, photographs etc”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala thanked Hooda for “exposing the petty politicisation by PM Modi”. “No one can use the valour & sacrifice of our brave soldiers to score cheap political points. Modiji is squarely guilty of compromising National Security & Strategic Interests by unwarranted chest thumping!” he wrote on Twitter.

Responding to a question from the audience, Hooda said in hindsight, it would have been better had the strikes been done secretly.
Army chief Bipin Rawat, meanwhile, said Hooda was “one of the main persons involved in the conduct of these (surgical strike) operations so I respect his words very much.”
“These are individual person’s perceptions so let’s not comment on them.He was one of the main persons involved in conduct of these operations so I respect his words very much,” he told news agency ANI."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a meeting on Thursday to review the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status India granted to Pakistan in 1996, in response to the September 18 Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir in which 18 soldiers died. Officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and Commerce Ministry are likely to attend the meeting.

Earlier this week, PM Modi had called a meeting with senior officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to weigh India’s options on trade-related relations with Pakistan. The decision to review the MFN status comes close on the heels of a meeting called by the Prime Minister on the Indus Waters Treaty. At the meeting, PM Modi had said, “Blood and water cannot flow together”, alluding to the recent Uri attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.
READ: PM Modi to review Pakistan’s Most Favoured Nation’s status
Contrary to what the name suggests, the MFN status does not grant any special treatment to Pakistan. Technically, by granting MFN status to Pakistan, India is committed to treat Pakistan the same way it would treat every other WTO member country in relation to the tariff being imposed on goods. On the other hand, Pakistan has not granted the MFN status to India and this issue has been raised on numerous occasion during bilateral discussion between the two countries.

It symbolises our national consciousness. This anger has the resolve to do something. (PTI/File)
On Uri attack
This cowardly act has shocked the entire nation. There are strong emotions of widespread grief as well as anger across the country. And, this is not only a loss for the families who have lost a son, a brother or a husband. In fact, it is a national loss. And, therefore, I will just reiterate to you, my countrymen, what I had said that very day, that the guilty will certainly be punished.
The anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value. It symbolises our national consciousness. This anger has the resolve to do something.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
During the 1965 war, Lal Bahadur Shastriji was leading us and then also similar feelings of rage, anger and patriotic fervour were sweeping the nation. Everyone wanted that something must happen, must be done. Then, Lal Bahadur Shastriji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country. He gave the mantra — “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” — which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation. Lal Bahadur Shastriji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement. Now, if all of us, that is, our armed forces, people in the government, fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely, and all of us countrymen, each citizen, make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism, our country will most definitely scale greater heights.
On Armed Forces
We have full faith in our armed forces. They will foil with their valour every such conspiracy, and they are the ones to reach the pinnacle of bravery so that we, their 1.25 billion fellow countrymen, can live peacefully and be happy. We are proud of our Army. We politicians have many opportunities to speak our mind and we do speak. But, the forces do not speak, they take action.
On Kashmir
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognise well the true face of the anti-national forces. And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace. Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest. Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country. Economic activities too should be back on track. During the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities. We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only ways to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development. We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations. I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
On Security Forces in Kashmir
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration. The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order. I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir."

Two days after 18 soldiers were killed in a terror attack on an Army camp in Uri, Army investigators are looking at the possibility of the Pakistani terrorists being guided to the attack site by someone familiar with the layout of the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters and the exact location of troops.
The terrorists, sources said, were even aware of the location of the office and residence of the brigade commander.

The focus of the investigation, sources said, is also on the route from Sukhdar, a small settlement on the Line of Control, which may have been used by the terrorists to sneak into Uri.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
With a population of barely 500, Sukhdar is just about four kilometres from the brigade headquarters. A forest between the village and the LoC could have helped the terrorists slip in undetected.

The terrorists, sources said, could not have carried out such a deadly strike without help from someone who not only knew the area but was also aware of troop movements and their exact location.
Sources said the terrorists first breached the LoC fencing and then the main fencing of the brigade headquarters, dodging pickets and checkposts of the Army and BSF.

“It is very difficult to sneak inside the brigade headquarters because it is a heavily guarded and fortified complex. Only people with complete knowledge could have managed to get inside the camp without being noticed,” sources said. “Investigators are looking at the internal angle. Even porters and Territorial Army personnel could be investigated.’’
The possibility of “insider help” has many takers in Uri.

Ajaz Ahmad, who has a shop near the brigade headquarters, said without “help”, such an attack was not possible. “Despite living so close to the brigade headquarters, we don’t know anything about it. How could people, who came from across the LoC, conduct such an attack? They had proper information about this place,’’ he said.
Following the attack, local porters have not emerged from the brigade headquarters. These porters usually returned home in the evening.

“There are more than 500 porters, mostly from villages close to the LoC, working with the Uri Brigade. Many among them would return home in the evening. After the attack, we have not seen them. They are likely inside,’’ another shopkeeper said.
After remaining shut for two days, shops in Uri’s main market opened Tuesday. The road that goes through the brigade headquarters — it is the lone link between Uri town and the Valley — remained closed to the public for the third day."

Lt General Zubair Mahmood Hayat, one of the leading contenders to become the next chief of the Pakistan Army, has held talks with a senior Chinese military official in Beijing, becoming the first top Pak military official to visit China after the Uri attack.
Lt General Hayat, chief of general staff of the Pakistan Army, held talks with Gen Fang Fenghui, member of China’s Central Military Commission and chief of the Joint Staff Department, state-run China Military Online reported. Although the report did not mention the purpose of the visit, it comes ahead of the scheduled retirement of General Raheel Sharif in November.
Gen Hayat’s trip is also the first time that a senior Pak Army official is visiting China since the attack on an Indian Army base in Uri in September by Pakistan-backed militants that killed 19 soldiers.
Gen Fang Fenghui in his meeting with Gen Hayat said China and Pakistan are “iron brothers” with all-weather partnership. China is willing to make joint efforts with Pakistan to achieve development so as to benefit the peoples of the two countries, the report quoted Gen Fang as saying."

Kashyap had in a series of tweets demanded PM Modi to apologise for his unscheduled detour to visit Nawaz Sharif on December 25, 2015. He said it was the same time Johar was also shooting for ADHM. Hence, considering both the connections were with Pakistan and during the same frame of time, targeting just one of them was wrong. When Bhandarkar was asked about his reaction on Kashyap’s statements, he said, “Whatever Anurag Kashyap said is wrong, Neither BJP nor the Government issued any ban, it has become a trend to protest against Modi Ji.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil faced a backlash after MNS demanded a ban on all the movies starring Pakistani artistes in Indian cinema, threatening them to leave India. Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) had on Saturday announced that they would not screen movies starring Pakistani artistes in the four states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa. The decision taken by the COEAI mainly covers single-screen theatres and comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack last month.
Kashyap is the latest entry in the list of industry stars who have criticised the entire issue around Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Om Puri, Shyam Benegal, Vikram Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt, along with actors Sidharth Malhotra, Alia Bhatt and Sushant Singh Rajput have been batting for the film’s release.
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the lead, and has Fawad Khan in a cameo. It is slated for a Diwali release."

(Twitter/@INCIndia)
Lt General (retired) D S Hooda, who was the Northern Army Commander in September 2016 when Indian troops carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control following the Uri attack, will now lead a task force set up by the Congress to prepare a vision paper on national security of the country.
Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday met the former Army commander to discuss the formation of the task force and its working with a select group of experts to chalk out effective strategies to guard the border, days after 40 CRPF jawans were killed in a terror attack in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Taking to Twitter, the party announced, “Congress President Rahul Gandhi met with Lt Gen DS Hooda (retd) to institute a task force on National Security which will prepare a vision paper for the country. Gen Hooda will lead the task force and work with a select group of experts.”

Earlier in the day, the party questioned the “priorities” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the PM continued shooting for a film in the Jim Corbett National Park for his “propaganda and publicity” even as jawans were killed in the terror attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Last year in December, while moderating a discussion on the ‘Role of Cross-Border Operations and Surgical Strikes’ at a Military Literature Festival, Hooda had taken a jibe at the Centre, saying the “overhype” of the strikes did not help and “it is not good” when “military operations get politicised”.
“Did the overhype help? I say, completely no. If you start having political resonance in military operations, it is not good. There was too much political banter, on both sides, and when military operations get politicised, that is not good,” he had said."

SonyLIV’s upcoming web series Avrodh: The Siege Within showcases what went into the planning of the 2016 surgical strike conducted by the Indian army on terror launch pads across Line of Control (LoC). It is helmed by Raj Acharya.
Based on Rahul Singh and Shiv Aroor’s book, India’s Most Fearless, Avrodh is backed by actors like Amit Sadh, Neeraj Kabi, Darshan Kumar, Vikram Gokhale, Anant Mahadevan and Madhurima Tuli among others.

Before the web series starts streaming on July 31, here’s a look at who plays who in Avrodh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

So what if he has gone back to Pakistan, actor Fawad Khan is still getting all the love from his fans in India. And the latest news from his end is exactly the breather you need on this dreary Wednesday. Fawad Khan, who gave us Kapoor & Sons around the same time last year, is prepping up for his next Pakistani project. But what’s popping eyes of his fans is his new beefed-up look.
More from the world of Entertainment:


This particular picture shared by Pakistani actor Mikaal Zulfiqar on Facebook surfaced a few days back. Fawad’s next project is Pakistani action drama, Maula Jatt 2, and as per Mikal’s caption of the picture, the actor has pumped some serious iron for the role. For someone who is known to play the guy-next-door, this is unchartered territory for Fawad. He has hit the gym and undergone a physical transformation for the role. The pic even shows Fawad sporting a thick beard. Aren’t we already curious?
Mikaal posted the pic and wrote, “#Gym #buddies #fawadkhan #mikaalzulfiqar”. Check out the click here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Fawad, who left his Bollywood fans asking for more with his short yet powerful stint in India with films like Khoobsurat, Kapoor & Sons and a special appearance in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, had to leave the country due to MNS’ ban on Pakistani actors after the Uri attack. But, for his fans, it doesn’t matter if he is doing good work here in India or in his home country. And any little news that trickles down from Fawad’s end only keeps the hype around him alive.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting Monday of the departments concerned with implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan. Sources said the meeting should not be read as anything more than an attempt to understand the intricacies of the 56-year-old treaty.
In the wake of the Uri attack, there have been calls to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty. Last Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup, responding to a query on the Indus Waters Treaty, said “for any such treaty to work, you need mutual trust and goodwill. I will leave it at that.”

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The 1960 treaty has survived wars and phases of frosty ties between India and Pakistan.
The treaty, which came after a decade of World Bank-brokered negotiations, classified the six rivers of the Indus system into ‘eastern’ and ‘western’ rivers. Sutlej, Beas and Ravi were eastern; Jhelum, Chenab and Indus itself were western.

The treaty gave India full rights over the waters of the eastern rivers, while it had to let the western rivers flow “unrestricted” to Pakistan. India could use the waters of western rivers only in a “non-consumptive” manner."

Punjab traders dealing in import and export of goods with Pakistan on Monday sought a fitting reply in the aftermath of Uri attack, threatening to end Rs 3,000 crore worth of trade with the neighbouring country for the “heinous act”.
“Time has come for India to take strict and swift action against Pakistan which is responsible for the Uri terror attack that left our several soldiers dead,” Amritsar-based trader and President of Federation of Dry Fruit and Haryana Commercial Association, Anil Mehra, told PTI on Monday.
“The Modi government should suspend all sorts of ties with Pakistan in response to the terror attack unleashed on Indian soil,” Mehra suggested.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Noting that there is a great amount of anger against this terror attack, which left 18 soldiers dead, Mehra said traders in Punjab are ready to end trade ties with Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah land route.
“We urge the Centre to even stop trade with Pakistan through Attar-Wagah land route. We are ready for ending trade ties with the neighbouring country, which is responsible for such an attack. For us, the country comes first and then comes trade. We will do something else for our livelihood,” said Mehra.
Traders asserted that it is Pakistan which is the most dependent on India for import of goods like vegetables, including tomatoes, ginger, garlic and spices, cotton yarn and the like.
Pakistan exports cement, gypsum and dry fruits to the country via the Attari-Wagah land route.
“If we today stop sending tomatoes which has been the major export item to Pakistan, they will face immense shortage of this perishable commodity. Moreover, if we do not import dates from Pakistan, they will not find buyers for this,” he added.
Traders further said Pakistan had not even allowed export of onions to India last year when the country was facing shortage. India then imported onions from Afghanistan.
Watch What Else Is Making News

Pakistan allows import of 137 items from India through Attari-Wagah.
As per estimates, the total volume of trade between the two nations via Attari-Wagah is estimated at Rs 3,000 crore per annum.
India and Pakistan had resumed cross-border movement of trucks in October 2007 after a gap of sixty years from Attari check post at Amritsar in India to Wagah border in Pakistan.
An integrated check-post was set up on the Attari-Wagah border in 2012 at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore for smooth movement of traffic."

“We will use all forms of social media to kick up a protest storm against Ae Dil… because it stars a Pakistani actor.

He, however, said it was yet to finalised whether there would be any protest in front of theatres too demanding ban on the two films. “We will be talking to RSS and BJP leaders here and decide whether there will be any protest outside cinema halls,” Mukherjee added.
State RSS and BJP leaders, meanwhile, said that they might lend support. “The VHP is a part of the Sangh ‘parivar’ so if they are protesting against something, which is anti-national and are asking for our support, we might lend it,” a senior RSS leader told The Indian Express.
BJP state president Dilip Ghosh too, echoed similar sentiments. “There has not been any dialogue with us and the VHP so far over this issue but as we have done in the past, we will speak up against anything anti-national. If the VHP is planning any such protest and we are convinced that the protest is for the country’s positive image. There is no reason why we will not support such protests,” he said.
Directed by Karan Johar, ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ is set to hit cinema halls on October 28. Fawad, who makes a special appearance in the film, had left for Pakistan last month soon after the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issued a threat to Pakistani actors and artistes to leave India post the Uri attack.
Dangal is slated to release on December 23 this year."

“Patriotism that propagates hate is not patriotism. United we rise. Divided we fall. Politicians polarise to rule, not serve society,” Dia tweeted on Sunday.

Her post comes amidst the ongoing clamour over the cross-border tension between the neighbouring countries, which spilt into the entertainment world and sparked a debate on whether Pakistani artists should be banned from working in the Mumbai film industry.
Some Indian outfits have imposed a ban on Pakistanis from Indian showbiz world and a few Pakistani theatres have pulled down Indian movies from their screens.
Celebrities across the board and borders have been commenting on the spillover, with some talking in support of the steps, some opposing it and some just keeping mum.
Superstar Salman Khan and veteran actor Om Puri came forward to support Pakistani talent but faced a backlash for their opinions.
Earlier this week, Pakistani talent Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan also broke their silence, with Fawad praying for “a more peaceful world”, and Mahira condemning any act of terror, no matter which soil it is on.

Meanwhile, a day after actor Fawad Khan talked about coming together to build “a more peaceful world”, fellow Pakistani actor Mahira Khan Saturday issued a statement with a prayer for peace. Both the actors have been under criticism after the Uri attack and their detractors have been asking them to take a stand.
Ajay Devgn has said he would not share any artistic space with Pakistani actors in the current situation. Director Farah Khan, on her part, has said she would prefer to cast “somebody from my own country”."

Swara Bhaskar thinks Pakistani actors who have refrained from commenting on the September 18 attack which killed 19 Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, are helpless about reacting to it.
More from the world of Entertainment:

 
“Art and artists should not be attached to politics. Pakistani artistes are in a vulnerable position; they are helpless… Keeping in mind that just three months ago, one of Pakistan’s best-known singers, Amjad Sabri, was gunned down by the terrorists,” Swara said on the sidelines of the seventh Jagran Film Festival here on Friday.
“I think the people of Pakistan themselves are also a victim of terrorism,” added the actress who has visited Pakistan twice.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pakistani actors like Fawad Khan, who have worked in India, are being widely condemned in the country for keeping their comments reserved in slamming the attack on Indian soldiers.
Swara, who is the daughter of well-known strategic analyst C Uday Bhaskar, said: “The entire issue (Uri attack) is very emotional for us. The way the soldiers have been killed is very much shameful. At this moment, the entire country is grief-stuck and fuming as well. This is quite justified.
“We have a responsible government and army. They are doing their work rightfully and we should let them tackle the situation.”
At the Jagran Film Festival, Swara received the Best Actress for “Nil Battey Sannata”, and she was happy about it.
Of late, a lot of actors from Bollywood have spoken about the issue including Salman Khan, Mahesh Bhatt, Saif Ali Khan, Karan Johar and Ranbir Kapoor. However, the controversy doesn’t seem to die anytime soon."

The audience has its say.
Ever since the release dates of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay were announced (October 28), it is not only the filmmakers but even the audience who has been eagerly awaiting their release. We already know that when two big films clash at the box-office, the promotion game is going to be extremely crazy. While the extensive promotion of Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s film has kept the buzz going, Ajay Devgn has not left any stone unturned to make sure that Shivaay does not lose its game against ADHM.
In fact, Ajay Devgn made a smart move to promote the film. From visiting the US office of Facebook to setting Raavan on fire at Delhi’s most popular Ramleela, he has been a one-man army when it comes to promotions. Meanwhile, Ranbir has been at the forefront of ADHM’s promotions.

To find out how excited the audience is about both the films, we asked them on Twitter which film they will be watching this Diwali.  According to the Twitter poll on indianexpress.com, the audience is keener to watch Ajay Devgn-starrer in comparison to Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. In fact, 57 percent said they would watch Shivaay while 43 percent opted for Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. A total of 888 votes were polled.

The promotions for both the films have not without incident. It all began when Ajay, on his Twitter account, claimed that self-styled movie critic Kamaal Rashid Khan has taken money from Karan Johar to promote Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
Later, Karan Johar and the film found themselves in the middle of a political storm for casting Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in the film. MNS ‘banned’ the film in the aftermath of Uri attack and was adamant that it will not be allowed to release despite a video clarification from Karan Johar. The matter could only be resolved after the intervention of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

Last week, experts from India and Pakistan met in Lahore to hold technical discussions on the welter of issues arising from the two countries’ joint administration of the Indus River waters system — the last remnant of significant diplomatic engagement between the two nations. The permanent Indus Waters Commission, which has survived through 57 years punctuated by four wars, has proved the most robust bilateral institution the two countries have created. It is also, however, the most fraught.
In water-scarce Pakistan, farmers’ organisations have threatened mass protests against what they cast as Indian plans to choke their irrigation systems; jihadists have been quick to cash in, using the issue to warn of a coming apocalypse. Islamabad used the talks to focus attention on three Indian projects that it claims violate the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the 1,000 megawatt Pakal Dul on the Chenab, the 120 MW Miyar, and the 43 MW Lower Kalnai. Pakistani media reports have claimed India has agreed to halt work on the Miyar project; New Delhi, for its part, has refused to comment on what it describes as “hypothetical contingencies”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In essence, New Delhi has decided to push forward with a series of major projects on the Indus system that evoke strategic fear in Pakistan. The most important of these new projects are the 1,856 MW Sawalkot dam, which promises to wipe out Jammu and Kashmir’s power deficit, and the Tulbul project, which would ease river transport between Srinagar and Baramulla. Though the projects are consistent with the IWT, Pakistan fears these — along with the dams at Salal and Baglihar — will give India the strategic capacity to devastate agriculture in Pakistan, should it choose to do so, by impounding water during critical periods of the agrarian cycle. Thus, water could become a weapon of war — a fear that has grown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that “blood and water cannot flow in the same direction” after the Uri attacks.
Fear, obviously, cannot be a reason for India to give up its legitimate treaty rights. Yet, India ought not to brush away Pakistan’s concerns; Pakistan, similarly, ought to be under no illusion that its use of terrorism to pursue strategic aims will be cost-free. This is because the Indus waters could be the basis for a very different relationship between the two countries. High dams in the inner Himalayas, inconceivable when the IWT was written, could provide Pakistan with the water it desperately needs. Those very dams could meet India’s bourgeoning power needs. The lesson is that a rational conversation between the two countries can open the way for win-win outcomes."

In light of the recent terrorist attack on an Indian Army encampment in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri town that killed 17 jawans, all eyes are trained on what the government will do next. Public sentiment is sharp and there is huge pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give perpetrators of the attack a befitting reply. Interestingly, the influential Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) has maintained a hyper-aggressive stance on such attacks emanating from Pakistan. After senior RSS functionary and BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav insisted that the way forward is “for one tooth, the complete jaw”, it remains to be seen whether the Sangh’s position will have a bearing on the way India’s retaliation is oriented.
Speaking on the Uri terror attack on Sunday, Ram Madhav said: “The Prime Minister has promised that those behind the Uri terror attack will not go unpunished. That should be the way forward. For one tooth, the complete jaw.” Prior to joining the BJP in his official capacity, Madhav served as spokesperson for the RSS and was a prominent member of its national executive.
Madhav said “the days of so-called strategic restraint are over” adding that “if terrorism is the instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Concurrently, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, second-in-command after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, gave a call for firm and conclusive action. “The terrorists, their masters and supporters should be dealt with firmly and conclusively.”
It is clear that the NDA government has a significant backing and influence of the RSS. Given the possibility that the RSS ideology and stance may shadow, or still is, the government’s Pakistan policy, PM Modi’s next move will be dissected and scrutinised in every manner possible. For years, Pakistan has perpetrated terror attacks on India. Its Inter Services Intelligence, GHQ of the Pakistani military and sponsored terror outfits have been actively targeting India exploiting our defensive standpoint and have time and again tried to make Kashmir a flashpoint.
Indian policymakers by and large have maintained a sagacious position of handling Pakistani terrorism in India and the role played by elements like JeM, LeT, Syed Salahuddin and others in escalating the tension between the two countries on the battlefront. The 26/11 attacks, Pathankot siege, Uri attack and a host of other terrorist and fidayeen attacks on Indian security forces have led to popular sentiment being aligned with the RSS view.
After the Pathankot terror attack in this January, the RSS, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Organiser, had said: “Non-state actors operate within boundaries of state with overt or covert support of some elements within. Therefore, national governments have to make a firm resolve to defeat them, without that no composite dialogue can take place. Resultantly, non-state actors become state themselves, as happened in case of the IS. Hope Pakistan does not move in the same direction.”
It had also held that the issue needs to be handled beyond blaming and cornering of governments. “Neither mere blaming Pakistan as perpetrator of cross-border terrorism nor cornering government for the sake of opposition will yield any results.”
Pakistan, which only appears to be intent on speaking about Kashmir’s sovereignty and not the Pak-supported terror activities in the region, has fuelled the divide in the state and promoted religious extremism and violence apart from civilian unrest. The BJP, which is the political offshoot of the Sangh, has tried to act amicably with the Pakistani government during its current tenure. However, several Sangh leaders echoed the view in in December 2015 that Pakistan is desperate to spread violence in Kashmir and that the international community, whose sympathy is sought by Pakistan after every attack, should be wary of their tactics.
India’s Pakistan policy is a complex issue and attacks on India’s sovereignty put the government in a more vexed situation. War with an unstable Pakistan, with an uncontrolled military and ISI, is a prospect that successive governments in the past decade and half have rightly stood off. However, the stance of absorbing continued offensives on a no-first-strike policy has done little to help India’s case. RSS has, apart from rare situations when PM Modi and in the past former PM Atal Bihar Vajpayee reaching out to Pakistan for dialogue, has maintained that negotiations or discussions on Kashmir are not an option and a soft stance makes India vulnerable to more attacks.
The government has a host of options to react further. It can urge Islamabad to take action on terrorists in Pakistan, or appeal sanctions on Pakistan from the international community, or resort to a cold start doctrine to neutralise terror heads in Pakistan with surgical strikes. It may even let the situation subside or resort to diplomatic dialogue as a measure to avoid a military or possibly a nuclear standoff with Pakistan. The Pathankot attacks resulted in increased militarisation of battle positions on the LoC and the tensions took so degree of effort to fizzle out. Madhav’s and Bhaiyaji Joshi’s views apparently resonate with the larger Sangh community to act without complacency. Madhav’s view of “For one tooth, the complete jaw” which looks to echo with the other RSS ideologues needs to be carefully handled by the government in times when popular sentiment endorses military action on India’s western neighbour."

Now Kashyap has yet again raised his voice and this time on nobody else but India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The filmmaker took to Twitter and wrote, “Sir you haven’t yet said sorry for your trip to meet the Pakistani PM.. It was dec 25th. Same time KJo was shooting ADHM? Why?” Kashyap was referring to PM Modi’s unscheduled detour to visit Nawaz Sharif on December 25, 2015.

In fact, the director didn’t stop there. He tweeted a couple of more questions pointing at PM Modi. He asked him, “why is it that we have to face it while you can be silent??” adding that PM Modi actually diverted his trip to Pakistan on our tax money. This, while the film was shot with the money on which someone here pays interest. The series of Tweets surely portray the kind of frustration Kashyap has over being a filmmaker and also resonates the trouble the artistes from the Indian film industry face. In another tweet, he wrote “The world must learn from us.. We solve all our problems by blaming it on movies and banning it.. #ADHM . With you on this @karanjohar.”

Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) yesterday announced that they would not screen movies starring Pakistani artistes in the four states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa.
KJo’s movie stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the lead. The decision taken by the COEAI mainly covers single screen theatres and comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack last month. Johar tweeted, “See you at the cinemas on the 28th of this month! #AeDilKiDiwali”.
Many industry people including Om Puri, Shyam Benegal, Vikram Bhatt, Mukesh Bhatt and Censor Board Chief Pahalaj Nihalani have slammed the ban on the release of the film which is ready for its release on the Diwali weekend this month.

According to a senior official, multiple teams of state police were probing the case, but had not made a headway. He said there were no witnesses to the murder, which was reportedly executed by four men on bikes.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan, who visited Sasikumar’s family Monday, said that since Sasikumar was murdered a day after Uri attack, it should be probed if Pakistani terrorists had a role in the crime. He said police protection to Sasikumar was withdrawn 15 days before the murder. “It is high time that police ensures the safety of Hindu leaders,” he told reporters.
Meanwhile, a senior police officer, who was part of the state police’s probe, ruled out the BJP leaders’ claim that Muslim terrorists were behind the murder.
“Such statements will only politicise the situation as Coimbatore has a history of communal violence,” he said."

Nallathambi, the good brother in Tamil, was a film in 1948 that was an act of revolt against the zamindari system. Written by Annadurai, the legendary Chief Minister of then Madras state, it is an early example of cinema’s intimate link with politics, social commentary, and what one might term ‘standing up’ now.
Tamil cinema continued the tradition of cinema being seamlessly about politics and society. Screenplay writer Karunanidhi, and actors MGR and Jayalalithaa dominated the state’s politics and it was cinema that they drew from and punched back in. Even recently, Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Captain Vijaykanth, Khushboo are people of cinema — who are in politics.
Andhra Pradesh’s N T Rama Rao or NTR is not just another vintage example of persons in cinema being political but also of cinematic tricks and spectacle being used to sharpen politics and give it wheels. NTR’s Chaitanya Ratham, a road-trip in a Chevrolet van which turned the push against the then invincible-looking Rajiv Gandhi into a storm, spun regional leaders into ‘national’ ones and changed politics.

Bombay cinema and its artistes and writers too have had their brush with the political. As early as 1948, Ram Daryani’s Ghar ki Izzat, a film about a subservient Indian son caught between his mother and wife, found it necessary to insert a song to mark the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi earlier that year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Prithviraj Kapoor came out of the India People’s Theatre Association (IPTA), the pre-Independence theatre body that used culture as a form of protest. In his memoirs, the late Socialist Madhu Dandavate recalls a session of the All India Congress Committee held in Bombay, before the formation of Pakistan, when all attendees were invited to watch Prithviraj Kapoor staging a play called Deewar, on the need to bridge distances between India and Pakistan.
In a newly independent India, even for — and especially for — Hindi cinema, it was impossible to stay away from national issues, politics and social commentary. The Communist Party, with its many members and sympathisers imbuing ideas of egalitarianism, amity and socially radical thoughts, played its part.
Mehboob Khan Productions had the hammer-and-sickle as part of his on-screen logo. Kaifi Azmi, Shailendra, Sahir Ludhianvi, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Krishan Chander and others through the Progressive Writers Association wrote lines that are still hummed every time there is a call for revolution. Actor Balraj Sahni’s photograph in bloodied clothes, after personally fighting back attacks on the party headquarters, adorned the CPI office building in Mumbai for a long time.
Nehru’s influence went beyond the formation of the Film Finance Corporation (FCC) in 1960 and the establishment of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in 1960. People close to him and his ideas, KA Abbas, Raj Kapoor, Chetan Anand, Nargis were vocal on issues and spared no punches, whether in themes they picked or comments made off-screen.
Critic and a scholar of cinema, Aruna Vasudeva, writes in The New Cinema (1986) ; “With the Film Finance Corporation’s policy decision in 1968 to start giving loans to new film makers for small budget, offbeat films, the means of production were radically expanded and the groundwork for the arrival of alternate cinema was laid.”
While the films made and released in the run-up to and after the Emergency offer little hint of the repression and turmoil of the times, Manoj Kumar’s Roti, Kapada aur Makaan, released in 1974, was an honourable exception. There is a scene when the hero is beating up a villainous grocer and ‘Vote for Congress’ is written prominently on the wall behind them.
Days after the political murder of theatre-personality and Communist activist Safdar Hashmi while performing a street-play, in January 1989, at the opening ceremony of the International Film Festival of India in Delhi, Shabana Azmi was asked on stage which directors had brought out the best in her. Azmi took the mic and said, “My views on my directors and the new wave can be reserved for a later date. What is very important right now is that we’ve been distributing some leaflets in the audience. My fear is that not all the leaflets have been equally distributed. And so, I choose this occasion to read out our protest, please bear with me.” She proceeded to calmly name the ruling Congress party.
Then there were big stars who entered electoral politics. Amitabh Bachchan took the plunge, first supporting his then family friend Rajiv Gandhi and later became an MP. Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Raj Babbar, Govinda and Nagma, among others, fought elections.
Things changed as Bombay cinema became the Bollywood film ‘industry’. There was money to be made and a lot to lose too. This tamed the voice emerging from the City of Dreams. With the Shiv Sena controlling Bombay and Bal Thackeray larger than life, Mani Ratnam had to infamously meet him and show him Bombay, a Hindu-Muslim love story in the aftermath of the Mumbai riots of 1992-93, before he could release the film. Actors were happier to do PR-inspired statements, appearances or placements in ways that products were made to do. The ‘industry’ put up little resistance when there was pressure on Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (there were calls for its ban after the Uri attacks since it starred Pakistani actor Fawad Khan) or Padmaavat (Rajput outfits sought a ban alleging it portrayed a Rajput queen being intimate with a Muslim king)
Yet, the most relevant instance of Bombay cinema’s history of connect with politics is in Balraj Sahni’s convocation address to JNU in 1972. On courage, he spoke with utmost candour: “More often than not I had lost courage at the crucial moment and taken shelter under the wisdom of other people. I had taken the safer path. I made decisions which were expected of me by my family, by the bourgeois class to which I belonged, and the set of values upheld by them. I thought one way but acted in another. For this reason, afterwards, I have felt rotten. Some decisions have proved ruinous in terms of human happiness. Whenever I lost courage, my life became a meaningless burden.”

Those who speak today, in some measure, shed that “burden” that Bollywood has borne for some decades now."

(Source: Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)
The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Wednesday decided to rename the iconic Race Course Road (RCR) as Lok Kalyan Marg, stating that the former does not “match with the Indian ethos and value system”. According to BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi, the name Race Course Road “conveys a feeling of disassociation and it can’t be the inspiration for any PM”. So now, the Prime Minister of India has a new address: 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.
What else is making news 

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which was attended by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi among others.The council meeting was called after Lekhi proposed that RCR be renamed. She had, however, suggested Ekatma Marg, based on the philosophy of BJP ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya.
This is not the first time that the government has decided to rename a prominent road. In August 2015, the council renamed Aurangzeb Road after APJ Abdul Kalam, following a demand by BJP MP Maheish Girri, who said the renaming should be seen as a measure to “correct mistakes in our history”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
New Delhi’s famous Race Course Road, significant to Lutyens’ heritage of the city, is no more. It was named after the Delhi race course, part of Delhi Race Club that was established in 1940.
However, when the news broke, many did not seem to take kindly to the decision to rename the road. Few users on Twitter mocked and criticised the government, while others were furious as the nations mourns the death of our soldiers in the Uri attack.
Here is how Twitterati reacted to the news:

PTI Photo.
Indian Test captain Virat Kohli today offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the Uri terrorist attack, saying such cowardly acts are “disturbing” and “hurts” every citizen of the country.
“When these big incidents happen regularly, it feels bad. When we feel bad about it, just think of the families of the soldiers. It’s something very disturbing,” Kohli said when asked to react on the recent terror strike on Indian soil.

“I can react on this but can’t comment on solution because I am not operating at that level. As an Indian it hurts. I can only pay my condolences to the families of the jawans, who suffered in these incidents,” he said after India crushed New Zealand by 197 runs to take a 1-0 in the three-Test series, here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Eighteen Indian soldiers were killed and several others injured when heavily-armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town last Sunday. Four militants involved in the terror strike were later killed by the Army.
A day after the attacks, Kolhi had tweeted out an image from Uri and said that they ‘fill him up with emotions he can’t explain’.The cricketer tweeted a picture of the attack site in Uri with smoke cover the whole site."

Posters have appeared in the Pakistani town of Gujranwala announcing that the Lashkar-e-Taiba will hold the last rites in absentia for one of the four terrorists who attacked the Indian Army’s 12 Brigade at Uri, killing 18 soldiers and sparking the worst India-Pakistan crisis in years.
The posters are the first evidence that the attacks were carried out by a Pakistan-based jihadist group — until now denied by Islamabad.
The posters name one perpetrator as Gujranwala resident Muhammad Anas, who operated using the alias Abu Siraqa. They invite local residents to join namaaz prayers for the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s “lion-hearted holy warrior Abu Siraqa Muhammad Anas, who sent 177 Hindu soldiers to hell at the Uri Brigade camp in occupied Kashmir, and thus drank from the glass of martyrdom”. (Lashkar literature routinely exaggerates the casualty count).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Bearing images of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the head of the Lashkar’s parent organisation, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the posters say the last rites will be held at Bada Nullah, near Girjakh, in Gujranwala.
Though Indian officials blamed the Jaish-e-Muhammad for the Uri attack in the days after the strike, The Indian Express had first reported that investigators believed the unit involved belonged to the Lashkar, based on the codes the assault team had used to speak with their commanders.
Two Garmin-manufactured GPS sets were recovered from the attackers but one was too badly damaged by fire for data to be retrieved. A second is being studied by forensic experts. Though syringes, painkillers and packets of ready-to-eat food carried by the terrorists bore the markings of several Pakistani manufacturers, linking the perpetrators to that country, these offered no evidence on the identity or affiliations of the terrorists themselves.
Government sources said two men arrested on charges of helping facilitate the infiltration of the group — Ahsan Khursheed and Faisal Awan — continued to provide contradictory testimony, showing little knowledge of the specifics of the attack. “It is possible they were transborder traffickers”, a source said, “but that they were not familiar with this particular operation”.
Lashkar teams have staged a series of increasingly daring attacks on Indian military units, notably one on soldiers of 24 Punjab Regiment and 31 Field Regiment near Uri last year, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers and three police personnel. In that case, GPS data showed the team had originated in the town of Chham, across the Line of Control, but the perpetrators remain unidentified. Intelligence services and the Jammu and Kashmir Police have, however, arrested Pakistani nationals alleged to be tasked with staging similar attacks, including Muhammad Naveed and Bahadur Ali. The Jaish-e-Muhammad, for its part, has focused on operations outside of Jammu and Kashmir, notably the attacks in Pathankot and Gurdaspur."

“Our civil n (sic) decent response in the past hasn’t been met with reciprocity so it’s time to act tough,” Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw tweeted.
PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Mahesh Gupta said there will be no impact on India’s trade and economy, adding that the volatility in the financial markets will also be short lived.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India’s exports to the neighbouring country worked out to $2.17 billion, or 0.83 per cent, of the total Indian outward shipments while imports were less than $500 million, or 0.13 per cent, of the total inward shipments.
“The Indian economy has a strong bandwidth to deal with any possible after effects of the current state of tensions with Pakistan,” Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
Recalling an earlier tweet in which he had said “I trust our army. They know how to pursue & retaliate” in the wake of the Uri attack, industrialist Anand Mahindra said: “I don’t need to add anything more today…”
The chamber said that while reaction in the stock market to the news of India’s surgical strikes was understandable, there is no cause of concern for the country’s economy which has the capabilities to withstand any extra costs to be borne for the sake of our national security.
Industry bodies Ficci and CII declined to comment.
Exporters’ body FIEO Director General & CEO Ajay Sahai too ruled out any negative impact on India’s trade with other countries. However, asked about the implications on India-Pakistan bilateral trade, Sahai said India’s move to review the most favoured nation (MFN) status accorded to its neighbour has raised some uncertainty for exporters on whether trade will normalise in the future.
“The overall impact of the Kargil war was actually positive. The economy grew at the same pace in financial year 1999-2000 as the year before — a healthy 6.5 per cent,” an SBI report said on Thursday. “Also, now that India has clearly reaffirmed that its patience cannot be taken as granted, these will in fact act as a positive for the markets for the decisiveness in the county’s foreign policy,” the report said.

Twitter/@Cyalm
This is about being Cyril and his cautionary tale. On Tuesday, most news channels — Times Now, India Today, CNN News 18, NDTV 24×7 and News X — extensively reported that Pakistani journalist Cyril Almeida, assistant editor Dawn, was placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) by the Pakistani government which, in effect, prevents him from leaving the country. Almeida, in a report published by the newspaper, claimed there was a deep rift between the civilian government and the military leadership in Pakistan over the country’s increasing isolation in the world, following recent Indo-Pak tensions.
Watch Video

Since Tuesday, the English news channels fiercely and rightly so, criticised the Pakistan government’s action: “Pak muzzling media”, “Journalist targeted by Pak govt” “#PakGagsMedia”, “Nawaz gags the media”, “Media crackdown in the name of security”, howled TV headlines. Other Pakistani journalists, including Dawn editors, were interviewed across channels and given a sympathetic hearing (NDTV 24×7, Times Now, India Today).
“#Pakquashes Freedom”, “Azadi in Peril”, declared News X during its Tuesday evening discussion, lauding the “intrepid’’ Mr Almeida. Anchor Rahul Shivshankar deplored the fact that some people in Pakistan, like Hafiz Saeed, Syed Salahuddin, were “free” to speak freely as their statements were perceived to be in the “interest” of Pakistan while others from “civil society” were gagged because they were at “cross purposes” with the government’s stance. Defence expert Ajai Shukla argued that Almeida had crossed the “red line” by suggesting that is was even “possible to question” the army while journalist Neerja Chowdhury reminded Shivshankar that Pakistan was not one entity, there were shades of opinion — and Shivshankar readily agreed. Almeida’s report raised issues about the Pakistani government and the military and his cause has been espoused by TV news channels and print — just as it ought to be.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But doesn’t this sequence of events have an uncannily familiar, if ironic, ring to it?
On TV news, some Indian opposition party politicians and members of “civil society” have done an “Almeida”: They have raised issues concerning the Central government and the security forces in relation to the violence in Kashmir, for evidence of the surgical strikes, for playing #surgicalpolitics — and on the issue of “banning” Pakistani artistes for their failure to condemn the Uri attack — note, they have been banned.
What happened? They have been attacked or “silenced” just as the PM “silenced the Opposition” with his Dussehra speech (CNN News 18).
On Thursday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said “credit” for the surgical strikes went largely to the PM. His comments that there were no surgical strikes in the past and “the frustration of 30 years were vented on September 29” were criticised by the Congress and other Opposition parties. On the Newshour Thursday evening, anchor Arnab Goswami questioned their questioning Parrikar: “Where is the politics (in Parrikar’s comments)? I don’t see (it). Does it occur to you that people of this country are angry with you for politicising this (the strikes)?’’ (Times Now).
Last week, NDTV 24×7 chose to not air the full interview with Congress leader and former Home and Finance Minister P Chidambaram on the “surgical strikes”, telecasting only excerpts during the day.
After the ECL to Almeida, Dawn in its editorial, reprinted in The Indian Express, spoke of the “importance of holding the state to account”. On Indian TV it seems to be the inverse.
The same news channels which applaud Cyril Almeida flagging the conflict between the Pakistani government and the Pakistani army, have questioned mocked, criticised such individuals/parties, holding them accountable for questioning the Indian government. Think Opposition leaders who tried to meet separatist leaders in Kashmir during the all-party visit to Srinagar in September, think Rahul Gandhi for his “dalali” comment (which Times Now Arnab Goswami called a “disgraceful remark”), think film personalities Shyam Benegal, Saeed Mirza, Om Puri, Salman Khan, and Mita Vashisht (“I am taking you off the show… take her off the show”, Times Now), to name a few. They have been accused of being pro-Pakistan, and anti-national for questioning the government.
By the same logic, is Almeida anti-national, too?"

So we’re not going to see Fawad Khan or moon-swoon over him. Not on television leastways; if the MNS in Mumbai has its way, perhaps not even on the big screen either. A shame, really: He’s good on the eye and the TV serials we’ve have seen him in were even better. However, after the Uri attack, anyone or anything Pakistani, it seems, is to be avoided.
Zindagi, the Subhash Chandra Goel channel which hosted Fawad and highly watchable Pakistani TV serials, has shown our neighbours the door: It will no longer — for now — telecast anything from across the LoC, as a patriotic protest over Uri. This decision will disappoint Indian viewers, many of whom cannot eat dinner if it’s not accompanied by a few morsels of Zindagi Gulzar Hai and its ilk.

And the reason why they sup with Pakistani serials is that the shows strike a chord: They are urban, contemporary, emotional family and marital dramas told realistically with good acting and, perhaps more pertinently, without the band-baaja-baraat treatment of Hindi serials where every tear flows like the Brahmaputra in spate.
Instead of Fawad & Co, Zindagi has a new line-up of Hindi shows from next Monday and if they are anything like the excellent Aadhe Adhure telecast previously on the channel, we may miss the Pakistani serials but we may not mourn their absence. Let’s see.
Meanwhile, Priyanka Chopra is creating waves across the oceans as the lead character in the American series Quantico (Star Premiere HD).
Season 2 of the American thriller has begun and as Alexandra Parrish (don’t you just love the name they’ve given her — couldn’t be less Indian than that?), an on-and-off rogue FBI recruit, Chopra now finds herself in the CIA along with her paramour Ryan. As we time-travel between “one year ago” and “one year later”, we catch Alex undergo fantastical training challenges (which she obviously meets after a few beads of perspiration) and try to save good men and women from the bad and the baddest — in this case, the US President, his wife and other world leaders, from terrorists.
With the support of a fine ensemble cast, Chopra acquits herself adequately, although her running and fighting skills don’t become a trained FBI and CIA operative. But let’s not cavil: She has gone where no other Indian actor has, literally, and dared to be seen in her underwear. Salute her.
Chopra is not the only Indian actress going places. Kalki Koechlin and her father Joel climbed onto Royal Enfield motorcycles (yes, we’re shown the brand several times in the first episode) and vroomed across the north-east in the new travel series, Kalki’s Great Escape (Fox Life). More than the drive, the first episode was interesting for the fluctuating dynamics between the two — Joel’s impatient, wanting to be on the move, she’s more watchful, laidback. It’s not riveting stuff but there’s something here that might develop nicely into a study of the “like father (un)like daughter” relationship.
The Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump relationship during the first US presidential debate was good television — at least when they were not debating (CNN). Trump would slide in his one line interjections, turn down his mouth, screw up his face; she’d just stare at him, at the camera, impassive, till there was a smile of all her teeth and that “Woo! Ok” shimmy when he spoke of his “winning temperament”. CNN’s favourite word for the evening? “Zinger”.
Lastly, Times Now and CNN News are squabbling in a most childish manner over which channel has the highest viewership: According to both of them, they both do and are running graphic campaigns to prove it for the last fortnight. Grow up, guys."

(File)
In a significant signal to New Delhi as well as the international community, US National Security Advisor John Bolton has supported India’s “right to self-defence” against cross-border terrorism, in his phone conversation Friday night with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
Bolton’s underlying message in the conversation is being read by New Delhi as a nod to a possible retaliatory strategic response by India , including military options.
Watch video: Modi says terrorists will pay for Pulwama attack

This is different from NSA in the Obama administration, Susan Rice’s conversation with Doval in September 2016, after the Uri attack. Then, the message was to exercise restraint, and that Pakistan should take action against Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other terror outfits.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The tone and tenor of Bolton’s phone call are different from Rice’s, and that has emboldened the Indian establishment’s strategic thinking in the last 24 hours since the phone conversation, sources said.
Incidentally, Rice’s phone call took place just hours before India conducted surgical strikes along the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
According to a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs Saturday, Bolton expressed condolences and “outrage” over the Pulwama attack Thursday in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber struck a convoy in J&K. Jaish has claimed responsibility for the attack.
“Ambassador Bolton supported India’s right to self-defence against cross-border terrorism. He offered all assistance to India to bring the perpetrators and backers of the attack promptly to justice. NSA Doval appreciated U.S. support,” said the MEA statement.
“The two NSAs vowed to work together to ensure that Pakistan cease to be a safe haven for JeM and terrorist groups that target India, the U.S. and others in the region. They resolved to hold Pakistan to account for its obligations under UN resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designating JeM leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee process,” said the statement said. The US had co-sponsored the resolution, along with France and UK, to list Azhar in 2017, which was blocked by China.
“I told Ajit Doval today that we support India’s right to self-defence. I have spoken to him twice, including this morning… and expressed the US’ condolences over the terrorist attack,” Bolton told PTI in Washington.
He also said the US has been very clear to Pakistan on ending support to terrorist safe havens. “We have been very clear on that score… And, we are continuing to be in discussions we are going to have with the Pakistanis,” he said.
On Twitter, Bolton said: “I expressed condolences to NSA Doval yesterday for the reprehensible terrorist attack on India. Pakistan must crack down on JeM and all terrorists operating from its territory. Countries should uphold UNSC responsibilities to deny safe haven and support for terrorists”, and then tagged a handle managed by Doval’s “followers and fans” @nsaajit.
In September 2016, the US National Security Council Spokesperson, Ned Price had said in a statement that Rice spoke to Doval and strongly condemned the September 18 cross-border attack on the Indian Army Brigade headquarters in Uri and offered condolences to the victims and their families.
“Ambassador Rice affirmed President Obama’s commitment to redouble our efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism throughout the world. Highlighting the danger that cross-border terrorism poses to the region, Ambassador Rice reiterated our expectation that Pakistan take effective action to combat and delegitimize United Nations-designated terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Muhammad, and their affiliates. In the context of the robust U.S.-India partnership, Ambassador Rice discussed our shared commitment with India to pursuing peace and regional stability and pledged to deepen collaboration on counterterrorism matters including on UN terrorist designations.”
However, this time, the signal from Washington, both from the US administration and the US Congress, was swift, stronger and much larger in scale. This is significant since the White House and the US Congress are at odds with each other.
And, that has been visible with statements from the US. While US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster was the first ambassador in New Delhi to tweet support to India on Thursday evening, the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also asked Pakistan to end its support to terrorist safe havens inside the country.
“We stand with India as it confronts terrorism. Pakistan must not provide safe haven for terrorists to threaten international security,” Pompeo said on Twitter.
In a stern message to Pakistan, the White House asked Islamabad to “immediately end” its “support” to all terror groups and not to provide “safe haven” to them, as the US condemned the brutal Pulwama terror attack.
“The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a late night statement on Thursday.
Top US lawmakers have rallied behind India’s effort to fight terrorism and said that such heinous crimes will not weaken the resolve of its people.
So far, more than 70 American lawmakers including 15 Senators have condemned the attack."

Barely two days after the terror attack in Uri, two infiltration bids were made from across the border in Kashmir on Tuesday but they were foiled by the Army in an encounter in which 10 terrorists and a jawan were killed even as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire and fired at Indian positions.
As the Government mulled various options on India’s response to the cross-border terror attack on Sunday in which 18 jawans were killed, a crucial meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security(CCS) has been convened on Wednesday.
“Two infiltration bids by militants from across the Line of Control(LoC) have been foiled in Uri and Nowgam sectors today. At both places the operations are in progress,” an army spokesman said in Srinagar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The spokesman refused to comment on the number of militants killed in the ongoing operations so far, saying details will be made public in due course.

He, however, said one soldier was killed in the operation in Nowgam sector.
Army sources in Delhi, however, said that 10 terrorists were killed in the encounter with the army in the Uri sector. The bodies have not yet been recovered, they added.
The sources said a group of 15 terrorists had attempted to infiltrate into Indian territory through the LoC.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh again reviewed the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir at a meeting in Delhi with top officials, including NSA Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar.
Separately, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said that any action against terrorists based in Pakistan will be taken only after examining all relevant issues.
On the ceasefire violation incident, an army official in Srinagar said the firing from across the LoC took place between 1.10 pm and 1.30 pm. However, there was no damage in the incident, he said.
“Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing by small arms towards Indian positions in Uri sector this afternoon,” the official said in Srinagar.
The official said while there were no reports of any casualty in the firing, further details of the incident were awaited.
The infiltration bids and the ceasefire violation came two days after four militants of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad stormed an army base in Uri Sector, killing 18 soldiers and injuring several others. All the four militants were also killed.
The terror attack has heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.
At the meeting convened by Rajnath Singh, Doval and top officials of the ministries of Home and Defence, paramilitary forces and chiefs of intelligence agencies briefed him on the prevailing situation in the Kashmir Valley as well as along the LoC, official sources said.
The presence of the Foreign Secretary at the meeting is significant as government plans to launch a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan."

Days after his country joined other neighbours in India’s boycott of the SAARC summit in Islamabad, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while endorsing New Delhi’s concerns on cross-border terror, Wednesday said it is a “core issue” on the SAARC table and will not end even if the regional club falls apart.
He said India has to see how to move forward in dealing with cross-border terror and make “this region relevant” since nothing has moved in SAARC in the last few years due to friction between India and Pakistan. After his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, Wickremesinghe said, “I must compliment Prime Minister Modi for the approach that he has taken… my take is, which we agreed with Prime Minister Modi, let us end cross-border terrorism. Let us make this region relevant.”

Asked whether Sri Lanka supported India’s surgical strikes against terror launch pads along the Line of Control with Pakistan, he said, “I can’t tell you what I spoke with Prime Minister Modi.” “Cross-border terrorism is on the table. SAARC has to look at it and discuss what has happened (postponement of the summit in Islamabad). How are we going to handle it? SAARC has to decide on two issues — cross-border terrorism and areas in which we can work together. If we don’t do it, there is no future for SAARC,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He expressed hope that the current predicament will be an “eye-opener” to rethink and reconsider issues of peace and security in the region.

On the slide in ties between India and Pakistan after the Uri attack, the Sri Lankan Prime Minister said, “I don’t think war is an option for anyone. I have seen war. I have seen terrorism. I have seen what terrorism has done in Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan.”
Asked about the delay in Sri Lanka’s decision to pull out of the SAARC summit, he said that his country’s Foreign Minister was travelling and they couldn’t have taken a decision without consulting him, since they have to answer to parliament.’
“(Sri Lankan) President spoke to Prime Minister Modi when the (Uri) attack took place and expressed his support,” he said. On the issue of fishermen, Wickremesinghe said, “Please come to Jaffna and see the suffering of our fishermen. Our Tamil fishermen raised the same concerns. The fishermen associations of both sides will meet in November.”
On his country’s relations with China, he said it is “economic, not a military one”. “By the time we took over, China had already given loans for the Hambantota harbour and the airport, nothing more. With India, we are doing a lot more — infrastructure projects, road projects, military cooperation. We have relations militarily, just like India does with China, but China had no military presence in projects such as Hambantota,” he said."

The countrymen should trust the armed forces which have shown their capability by carrying out the surgical strike against terrorists, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday.
Speaking in the backdrop of the recent killing of Indian soldiers along the Line of Control, the minister asserted that the nation’s honour would not be allowed to be harmed under any circumstances. “People should keep trust on the forces. Indian soldiers successfully executed operation against terrorists on Pakistani soil after (Uri) attack and gave a strong message to the world that if needed, Indian soldiers can hit terrorists on their soil,” Singh said.
The honour of the country would not be harmed under any circumstances, the Minister said. “We have destroyed their posts after entering their territory and are proud of our soldiers and army and have immense faith in them,” Singh said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He was addressing a public gathering after unveiling a statue of Mewar ruler Rana Pratap in Pali district of Rajasthan. Singh said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has emerged as a strong nation.
Stating that Maharana Pratap did not get his due place in history, Singh urged historians to re-evaulate the contribution of the Rajput warrior. “I am surprised that historians called Akbar as great but not Pratap. What shortcoming did they notice in Pratap that he was not referred to as ‘the Great’,” the minister said.
Singh said the Mewar ruler was a true statesman. He sacrificed his throne and leisure and fought for self-respect, presenting an exemplary example of valour, he said. “I have no objection to Akbar being referred so but I would appeal to historians that a correct assessment of Pratap should be there in the history of the country,” Singh said."

As the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena claimed victory following the compromise struck with the makers of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, the Opposition attacked Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP for “brokering a deal”.
The Congress called the meeting between MNS chief Raj Thackeray and filmmaker Karan Johar at the Chief Minister’s official residence on Saturday morning as “unconstitutional”. The NCP said that the “settlement struck with the help of the CM” was an insult to the Army soldiers killed in the Uri attack.
WHAT ELSE IS MAKING NEWS

“The Chief Minister is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state. But he has shown that he is incapable of observing law and order by bowing to the whims of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. In fact, he has set a bad example by making others submit to them too,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Congress said the issue of banning the entry of Pakistani actors and artistes in the country was a subject of the central government. “It does not fall within the ambit of the state government. The state’s responsibility is limited to providing law and order,” Sawant said. “The Chief Minister was not only a witness to an unconstitutional meeting, but he promoted it further,” he said.
The Congress reminded Fadnavis that former Congress minister Ashok Chavan hadn’t given in to the Shiv Sena, which had similarly threatened to block the Shahrukh Khan starrer My Name is Khan in 2010.
NCP national spokesperson and former Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik too hit out at the Chief Minister, and suggested that there was “tacit understanding” between the BJP and MNS.
“The MNS target even for Lok Sabha polls (in 2014) was to hand BJP a victory at the cost of the Shiv Sena in the state,” Malik said, indicating that Saturday’s meeting had a bigger political script to it.
In a veiled dig at the Shiv Sena ahead of the crucial Mumbai municipality polls, Malik said, “The BJP controls MNS’s engine (the MNS party symbol is an engine). It fuels it when required, and then applies brakes to it when necessary.” In the previous two civic polls held in 2007 and 2012 in Mumbai, the MNS had significantly dented the Shiv Sena votebank.
Both the Congress and the NCP said the MNS had a history of going back on issues it rakes up. “They (MNS) never take the matter to a logical conclusion. After raking up an issue for electoral gains, they either leave it midway or settle for a compromise.”
Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi too criticised the MNS over its repeated flip-flops."

Sending the strongest signal of deterioration in ties with Pakistan in the wake of the September 18 Uri attack, India Tuesday announced it will not attend the 19th SAARC summit in Islamabad in November. Official sources claimed Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan too have reservations on attending the summit.
The announcement was made by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) which said “increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of member states by one country have created an environment that is not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad”.

MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup also tweeted: “Regional cooperation and terror don’t go together.” A day earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told officials at a meeting on the Indus Waters Treaty that “rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta” (blood and water cannot flow together).
In London last Saturday, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said it was his hope that all SAARC members would attend the summit in Islamabad.
In first remarks on the Indian decision, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman said it had noted the Indian spokesperson’s tweet on the announcement about the refusal to participate in the summit.
“While we have not received any official communication in this regard, the Indian announcement is unfortunate,” the spokesperson said. Pakistan, he said, remained committed to peace and regional cooperation. “We will continue to work to that end in the larger interest of the people in this region,” he said.
This is the first time India will boycott a SAARC summit, first held in Dhaka in 1985. Government sources said boycott of a SAARC summit by any head of government means that the summit has to be postponed.
At the 2007 summit in Delhi, Bangladesh was represented by an advisor to the then caretaker government but the rules, sources said, have since been changed — a summit can now take place only if all SAARC heads of state or government participate.
Even after the attack on Parliament in December 2001, India attended the SAARC summit in Kathmandu in January 2002 despite a tense border standoff with Pakistan. One of the enduring images of that summit was when General Pervez Musharraf walked up to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to shake his hand. In fact, that summit was held after 1998 — a four-year gap owing to tensions between India and Pakistan post Kargil.
At the last summit in Kathmandu in November 2014, Modi and Sharif shook hands at the end of the summit — to a round of applause from all present. Even at that time, ties were frosty and Foreign Secretary-level talks had been cancelled.
On Tuesday, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said: “India remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in an atmosphere free of terror. In the prevailing circumstances, Government of India is unable to participate in the proposed summit in Islamabad,” he said.
“We also understand that some other SAARC member states have also conveyed their reservation about attending the Islamabad summit,” he said."

Indo-Pak relationship will not be same again and India’s patience with the neighbour is running out, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said as the government weighs its options following the deadly Uri terror attack.
With voices, including within the BJP, calling for retaliatory action against Pakistan following the Uri terror attack, the Union Law and Information Technology minister said the Modi government will take appropriate action keeping in the mind the national interest.
Asked about reports of India weighing options likes surgical strike in Pakistan territory, he told reports that such matters are not discussed with the media.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Our relationship with Pakistan will not be same again. Our patience is running out. There is a limit to patience. The government will consider strategic and diplomatic options and take a decision,” he said.
To a question that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing criticism for the gap between his tough rhetoric when BJP was in the opposition and his government’s action vis-a-vis Pakistan, Prasad said BJP’s policies are in tune with the national interest.

The opposition parties should keep politics away from this matter, he said. BJP National Secretary Sidharth Nath Singh said the

government will do whatever it has to in the national interest and it is serious about the issue.
“If something has to be done, it will be done. There is no need to talk about it,” he said, adding that it will take action at an appropriate time and has been fully behind army on such matters.
“Whether to respond to Pakistan diplomatically, economically or by some other means is a decision which the government will take,” he said."

(File photo)
CPI(M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami on Wednesday said the former MP Tariq Hameed Karra should have raised the Kashmir issue in Parliament instead of resigning from his Lok Sabha membership.
Karra, who quit PDP and Lok Sabha recently, “has the right to take a decision. However, I would not lose any opportunity or platform to raise my voice,” Tarigami told reporters when asked whether he agreed with the step taken by Karra.

“Karra should have spoken about the situation in Kashmir in the Parliament,” Tarigami said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Talking about the tension between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack, he said it should not be an “excuse” for confrontation as dialogue among all stakeholders is the only way to settle the Kashmir issue amicably.
“There is no alternative to talking and the recent unfortunate incident at Uri should not be an excuse for confrontations and hostilities between the two neighbouring countries of the region,” Tarigami said.
“India and Pakistan should not treat Kashmir as a chess board and must shun the rigidities for paving a way for lasting solution of the vexed Kashmir problem,” Tarigami said.
The MLA from Kulgam assembly segment said the dialogue should not be through interlocutors but with the involvement of the Parliament by constituting a committee of senior Parliamentarians.
“A purposeful and logical dialogue demands constitution of a committee of parliamentarians across the political spectrum assisted by experts and mandated with an initiation of serious and unconditional political dialogue for resolution of Kashmir issue,” he added.
Tarigami termed it as s “political unrest” and demanded that laws like Disturbed Areas Act, Public Safety Act and Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) should be revoked.
He also called for withdrawal of armed forces from civilian areas of the state.
The MLA also demanded setting up of a judicial commission headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to probe the civilian deaths in the unrest and a ban on use of pellet guns.
Seeking adequate compensation for the families of victims, he demanded rehabilitation of the affected.
“The horticulture and transport sectors have been affected and must be compensated by waiving of interest on the loans,” he said.
In response to a question, Tarigami said he did not support the demand for holding plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir under the UN auspices."

A day after he reached out to the people of Pakistan by differentiating between them and their government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday said the “anger” in India over the Uri attack “symbolises our national consciousness” and “I will just reiterate… that the guilty will certainly be punished”.
Addressing the people on his Mann Ki Baat radio programme, the Prime Minister said: “The country is proud of its Army. Citizens and politicians get many opportunities to speak, and do speak. The Army does not speak, the Army takes action, shows its prowess.”

“During the 1965 war, Lal Bahadur Shastri was leading us and then too similar feelings of rage, anger and patriotic fervour were sweeping the nation. Everyone wanted that something must happen, must be done. Then, Lal Bahadur Shastri… gave the mantra ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation. Lal Bahadur Shastri showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen to express patriotism.”
Modi also reached out to the people of Kashmir who, he said, have begun to “recognise well the true face of anti-national forces. And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace. Every parent wants schools and colleges to function properly at the earliest. Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country. Economic activities too should be back on track. During the last few days, there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.”
“We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development. We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations. I am very sure that by sitting together, we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.”
“Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration. The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order. I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir,” he said.
Addressing the BJP conclave in Kozhikode Saturday, the Prime Minister had nuanced his attack on Pakistan with strategic restraint, challenging it to go to war instead against poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and infant mortality.
On Sunday, taking the argument of restraint further, Modi referred to a letter written to him by 11-year-old Harshvardhan who gave expression to his anger over the Uri attack by pledging to study an extra three hours everyday to become a good citizen.
“A few days back, a Class XI student, Harshvardhan, put before me a different thought. He wrote that he was very disturbed after the Uri attack and felt a strong urge to do something, but was unable to find a way and decide because what could a young student like him do.” Modi said the boy found a way saying “I have taken a vow that I will put in three hours of extra study everyday. I will become an able citizen who can do something for the nation.”
Praising him, the Prime Minister said: “Bhai Harshvardhan, it is a matter of happiness for me that at such a tender age, you can think in such a healthy manner in an atmosphere of such anger. But Harshvardhan, I will also say that this anger, which is in the heart of every countryman, has great value. This is a symbol of national consciousness. This anger also shows a resolve to do something.”"

(Instagram/Mahira Khan)
Mahira Khan is not a stranger to controversies. The Pakistani actress, who landed a dream debut in Bollywood opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Raees, was unfortunately caught in the middle of a political turmoil between India and Pakistan owing to the Uri attacks and a ban on Pakistani artistes working in the country. With her film set to release on January 25, there’s a lot of buzz going around its delivery at the Box Office. Promotions are going on in full-swing but minus the actress, as she has been barred from promoting Raees in India with her team. But did this dampen her spirits? No. What if India is off-limits, there’s always Dubai! Khan was seen promoting her film and in style!
	
	
		
			
For her first appearance, the actress chose a chic off-shoulder Lavish Alice jumpsuit in white with a twisted front, which also gave the impression of a knot. The actress went ahead with voluminous curls and a pair of metallic ankle straps. Celebrity make-up artist Krystal George rounded her look perfectly with soft, subtle make-up. We love her choice of outfit and how she kept the look simple and classy at the same time.
	
	
		
			
For another round of promotions, Khan was seen stepping out in a chic brown pleated midi dress from House of Nomad, which she paired beautifully with a matching coat. A pair of black Louboutins, low ponytail and red lip complemented her look. We think, here too the actress looked lovely.

Veteran Tollywood actor Mohan Babu on Sunday expressed disappointment about no one stepping forward to provide financial aid to the martyrs of the Uri attack.
“Sad that I don’t see the same individuals coming forward with financial support to the martyrs of our army as they did for sports stars,” the actor tweeted.
More from the world of Entertainment:

He joined the list of actors expressing solidarity and saluting the 17 ‘heroes’ who lost their lives in the militant attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri last month. “Saluting the real heroes of our country, our Armed forces; for whom we owe a lot. Jai Jawan! & glad to have a PM who is so strong willed!” Mohan Babu posted.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In one of the worst casualties suffered by the Indian Army in recent times, a fidayeen attack left at least 17 soldiers dead at the rear base of an infantry regiment in Uri on September 18. The early morning attack was carried out by four terrorists, all of whom were neutralised.
Other people from the film fraternity including Rana Daggubati, Allari Naresh and Bollywood stars Shah Ruk Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Sonakshi Sinha have shared grief condemning the attack. Some actors even appreciated India’s counter surgical strikes that took place in Pakistan.
“Proud of the Indian Army and our government on taking solid anti-terrorism measures in safeguarding our nation! JaiHind!!” Rana had tweeted.
Comedy actor Allari Naresh also condoled for the deaths of the soldiers. “17 martyrs. Each was somebody’s everybody. My heart goes out to their families. Is it really that difficult for peace to prevail? #UriAttack,” he said."

One must not hold one’s breath that the Quetta terrorist attack by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi on the police training academy killing 51 and injuring 170 Pakistanis would finally persuade the ISI and Pakistani establishment that harbouring terror nurseries on their soil to hurt India is a dangerous business. The terror — it is nothing but evil– has a habit of turning into Frankenstein’s monster; the evil one nurtures within, to do harm without, often destroys the nurturer. It knows no kith or kin other than its own twisted logic. Islamist Jihadi terror– its creation–is now tearing Pakistan apart, bringing it to the brink of being a failed state.

But it is quite clear from Pathankot, Uri and other cross border attacks by Pakistani terrorists that the dangerous game of terror that Pakistan has been playing for some time is still on, supplemented by continual cross border shelling and countless violations of ceasefire by its unbridled military.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Quetta is just the latest terror attack in Pakistan. There have been scores of them; some against the Shias and many others against other targets. One would have thought that Pakistan’s military bosses and the ISI, the de facto government of Pakistan, would definitely have learnt a lesson from the Peshawar school attack of over a year ago that killed scores of Pakistani military’s children.
The rulers of Pakistan seem to have learnt nothing from their past experience. But one thing is clear–and it can’t escape the notice of even a casual observer, let alone the ISI minders of terrorists: The similarities between the Uri attack in India and Quetta in Pakistan once again prove that the terrorists do take to heart and put in practice what they are taught by their Pakistani trainers.
In both Uri and Quetta the intended victims were asleep, and as such soft targets, when stealthily attacked.
In Uri the ambush attack happened when the jawans were all asleep in their tents. Although in the end all four terrorists were killed; but they clearly succeeded in doing significant damage. Reportedly Lashkar-e-Taiba, a one time favourite terrorist outfit of the Pakistani rulers, had claimed responsibility for the Uri attack.
In Quetta the police trainees and trainers were all caught asleep by the terrorists. The terrorist were able to inflict death and destruction upon unsuspecting sleeping cadets. The Quetta attack was carried out by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, goup that has roots in Punjab where most of its recruits come from; the same province where many terrorists infiltrating across the India- Pakistan border come from, including those responsible for the deadly 26/11.
Pakistan is home to numerous terrorist producing nurseries; so much so that in the security parlance Pakistan is known as a terror factory that threatens the peace of many countries.
It is troubling that under these terribly grave circumstances China continues to do the bidding of the Pakistani military and ISI by standing in the way of the UN designating Jaishe-e-Mohammad a terrorist outfit. It has made many flimsy excuses for opposing India’s UN bid to have JeM declared terrorists while continuing to falsely claim China is against all forms of terrorism.
But it seems China won’t for long be able to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. Within China’s own borders is brewing a dangerous insurgency in the Xinjiang province. Not all the outfits seeking autonomy for the Uyghur Muslim minority are Islamists; but some definitely are. Xinjiang has 10 million Uyghurs, Kazakhastan 250000 and Kyrgyzstan 50000. Some of them have links with each other and with Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda’s current leader Ayman-al-Zawahiri had recently encouraged the Uyghur Islamists to “strengthen the fire of Jihad” against the Chinese infidels. Zawahari’s exhortation for Jihad against China predated the recent terrorist attack on the Chinese embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; the attack appears to have been carried out by terrorists linked to Al-Qaeda and the Uyghur extremists.
Perhaps China will begin to understand that it can’t much longer afford to be selective about terrorism. Several weeks ago it was the Chinese Embassy in Bishkek. Then it was Uri in India. The latest was Quetta in Pakistan. Terrorism is a common enemy demanding a common front.
Pakistan must stop being a factory of hate and terror and China must refuse Pakistan even the faintest succour for the terror it continues to sponsor and breed.

( Photo Credit: Mark Blinch/Reuters)
The millennials have known Om Puri for his character roles in films including Chup Chup Ke, Hera Pheri, Maalamaal Weekly and many other films. However, the true delight of watching Om Puri as a complete artiste lies in 80’s and 90’s films when art cinema was taking its roots in the country. The actor’s raw talent is reflected in his works in cult films of 80’s including Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, Mirch Masala and Ardh Satya. Om Puri played an important role in arthouse cinema during 80’s and 90’s. For those who want to know Om Puri as an individual and artiste, his recent tweets can be helpful.
Looking back at his career, Om Puri earlier tweeted, “I have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn’t have a conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it.” Not many actors can say proudly as Om Puri said this line, “I have been in the film industry for 35 years, and everyone, including the spot boys, will vouch for my character.”

 
The actor also voiced his opinions on contemporary films and politics. In one of his tweets, the actor remarks, “What Bollywood lacks is scripts. A lot of the films are copies of western films.” He also shared his thoughts on parallel cinema in the country saying, “Parallel cinema has not made an effort to communicate in a language the other person understands.” His hunger to do solid roles reflects in this tweet, “I prefer working in good cinema, wherever it is. I like subjects that have a universal appeal.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, Om Puri’s love for art cinema kept creeping back in his tweets. In one note, he says, “It’s my first preference to do films with social significance. Art cinema has given me credibility and status as an actor, but commercial cinema has given me a comfortable living.”
Om Puri was also one of the few actors to lend support to Pakistani actors in the aftermath of Uri attacks. The actor shared one note that says, “Pakistani artistes are not working illegally here and if they are sent back, Indian Producers, who have signed them for their films, will suffer heavy losses.”






This tweet is perhaps Om Puri’s best take on life and its vagaries, “I don’t expect anything from anybody When You Grow Old.Your Days Are Gone; It Is Part Of Life.” It would not be an exaggeration to say that for all theatre and cinema lovers, an era comes to an end with the death of Om Puri."

Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Wednesday said Pakistan is open to using ‘tactical devices’ against India should it feel threatened by its neighbouring country. The minister said this in an interview to Pakistan news channel SAMAA.
In an edited version of the interview, put out by the news channel on its website, the minister is heard saying: “Tactical weapons joh hain, joh hamne yeh progammes develop kiya hua hai, yeh apne hifazat ke liye develop kiya hua hai. Hamne devices jo hain just as showpieces toh nahin rakhe hue. Lekin agar hamare salamati ko khatra hua, toh hum nestanabhut kar denge unko (Tactical weapons, our programmes that we have developed, they have been developed for our protection.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His response comes a day after India, in a demarche, summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and handed over proof that the Uri attackers originated from across the LoC.
Meanwhile, speaking to The Associated Press, Asif said once Kashmir gains ‘independence’ India will disintegrate. “When the freedom movement in Kashmir succeeds, it will be beginning of the end of India,” he said. Asif said the sacrifices of Kashmiri people will not be in vain and that “India will disintegrate and it will not remain united” when Kashmir gains independence.
He also claimed that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had tried to improve ties with India, but “we did not get a positive response from them.”

This, however, is not the first time that Asif has claimed that Pakistan is ready to attack India. In August 2015, state-run Radio Pakistan quoted him as saying that India will suffer “heavy losses” which it would “remember for decades” if it tries to “impose” a war on Pakistan. His remarks came at a time when tensions were high at the LoC and Pakistan called-off foreign secretary-level talks following India’s stand that a discussion on Kashmir was off the table and a meeting with Separatists won’t be acceptable.
“If India tries to impose war on Pakistan, heavy losses will be inflicted on India which it will remember for decades,” he had then said.
India has, with evidence, blamed Pakistan-based terrorists for the attack at the Uri army base that killed 19 Indian soldiers.

 
Asif, however, claimed that no proof implicating Pakistan in the Uri attack had surfaced yet, telling DawnNews that “it was evident the attack was a plan devised by India itself.” One of the four terrorists involved in the Uri attack has been identified as Hafiz from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Asif claimed that the “entire world knows now that India is not as serious about resolving the Kashmir dispute as Pakistan is”.
Arms Race
A report  by Greg Thielmann and David Logan of the Princeton University highlights the arms race in the region. The report claims that while India has 118 warheads, Pakistan has 130. And China has 180 — 263 if the DF-26 waiting dismantlement is included."

If you’re willing to spend a minute of your precious time and give in to the latest Twitter trend, Google ‘namak haraam country’ and you’ll find India pop-up as the suggested search result. But before anybody could even make sense of what this was all about, people – specially those from you know where – took to Twitter and attempted to mock India for being the ‘namak haraam country’. Yeah right.
Before you decide to shed some outrage and term this as “derogatory and unexpected from Google”, you should probably just relax and not care too much. The reason why India pops-up is pretty straightforward. ‘Namak haraam’ is a popular 1973 Hindi film starring Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna and Rekha. Now, if India doesn’t pop-up next to a very popular Indian film, we’d be quite upset. We are, after all, proud of our film industry that even gives the careers of several actors from neighbouring nations a much-needed boost.

A question that has troubled me ever since Maulana Masood Azhar became one of the jihadist fiends we released in Kandahar 20 years ago is why he is still alive. Why was he along with the other monsters released in exchange for the passengers of IC 814 not killed immediately after they sped across the border into Pakistan? The military men who rule the Islamic Republic have never hesitated to admit that the jihadi groups they created were ‘assets’ in their unending war against India, so they would have no right to complain if we started destroying these assets by covert means. So why have we never done this? Could it be because we do not have the ability to do this? If not, why not?
When Narendra Modi became prime minister, he promised not to be as much of a wimp as the prime ministers before him. He used strong language to condemn their wimpy behaviour. After the attack on the military camp in Uri three years ago, there was that famous surgical strike. It was a tough immediate response. But, surely since then, there should have been time to build enough covert assets to conduct exactly the sort of war inside Pakistan that the Islamic Republic’s military rulers have been conducting on Indian soil for far too long? It is because India has not yet learned to fight this new kind of war that evil men like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar are still able to do what Jaish-e-Mohammad did last week in Pulwama.

These Pakistani ‘assets’ are religious fanatics who have a hatred for India that is visceral. In a memoir Masood Azhar wrote soon after being freed, he wrote of how the Indian Minister of External Affairs, Jaswant Singh, had offered him food and water on the flight that took him to Kandahar and how he had refused. “I did not want to sip even a drop of Indian water,” he wrote. He drank plenty of it when he spent years in Indian jails and to this day it makes no sense why nobody quietly poisoned that water while he was a guest of the Government of India. The other man who we should have been dealt with similarly was Omar Sheikh who was released in the same exchange. He also spent years in Indian jails.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
If we can have special courts to try rapists, why do we not have special military courts to try jihadists? In ‘secular’ Congress times, this was not a question anyone could have asked without being labelled a hawk because senior Congress leaders were not even prepared to accept that the 26/11 attack was a Pakistani military operation. A former chief minister released a book whose title said that the RSS was behind the attack on Mumbai. And, the man who is now Congress president told an American ambassador he was more worried about Hindu terrorism than the jihadist kind.
So we learned to live with what we continue to wrongly call ‘Pakistani terrorism’.
It is not. It is war. When the surgical strike in 2016 was Modi’s response to the Uri attack, there was hope that Modi understood the need to fight back hard. Surgical strikes have their place but why are we not using the same tactics that the Pakistani army is using against India? If it is because we have not created the assets to do this, then shame on us. We need these assets more than we need Rafale fighter jets because there is unlikely to be another old-style war on our benighted subcontinent. There will not be that kind of war because the Pakistani military has proven that it is unnecessary when they can continue to deploy ‘assets’ like Masood Azhar.
So what happens now? With India on the verge of a general election, there is little time to do more than spout the kind of platitudes we heard from senior political leaders after the Pulwama attack. ‘The sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain,’ tweeted the Prime Minister and the Home Minister echoed this sentiment. The Governor of Jammu & Kashmir accepted that there had been a major intelligence failure.
But is there nothing more we can do? Since we are in a state of undeclared war with Pakistan, surely we can, at the very least, break diplomatic relations. Is there any point in having an embassy in Islamabad when Pakistan has made it so clear that it has no intention of calling off its cowardly, shameful war?
What must be done even more urgently is to prepare our soldiers and para-military forces to fight the kind of war that is being fought against us. Attacks like the one that killed 40 CRPF men last week are not acts of terrorism; they are acts of war.

Even as diplomatic dialogue between India and Pakistan remains at a standstill, the cultural relations between the two nations took a step forward with the Karachi Literature Festival. KLF, which was held from February 10 to 12, saw the Indian government’s flagship cultural body as one of its sponsors.
Indian Council for Cultural Relations’ (ICCR) involvement with the event in Karachi comes at a time when Pakistani artistes continue to be banned from performing in India. According to a Times of India report, the government is determined not to give up on people-to-people contact, even if political differences with Islamabad were insurmountable.
“We are working to increase India’s cultural footprint across the world under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, including in Pakistan,” ICCR director general Amarendra Khatua told TOI. This is the first time ICCR is sponsoring the event, which began in 2010. Speaking to news agency ANI, Khatua said, “We have not sponsored Karachi Literature Festival, only the four participating Indian authors.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
ICCR’s involvement in KLF comes weeks after Pakistan declined an invitation by Indian Parliament and Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) to attend South Asian Speakers’ Summit to be held February 18-19.
The dismissal of cultural ties between the two nations started in the aftermath of Uri attack, where infiltrators from Pakistan killed 18 Army personnel in September 2016. Following that India retracted its participation from SAARC summit and placed an effective ban on Pakistani artistes performing in India."

BJP president Amit Shah Friday accused Congress chief Rahul Gandhi of supporting “urban Naxals” plotting to assassinate the prime minister and asked him to clarify his stand on the issue to people in poll-bound Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
Shah’s comments come in the wake of the Maharashtra police arresting five human rights activists late last month for their alleged links with Maoists.
Addressing party workers, Shah also mocked Gandhi, calling him “Rahul baba” and saying he is “day-dreaming” about the Congress’ victory in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, BJP-ruled states where elections are due by year-end.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said “Rahul Gandhi and company” were supporting “urban Naxals” plotting to assassinate the prime minister.
“Shouldn’t those who were plotting to assassinate the prime minister be arrested?” Shah asked. “Rahul baba should make his stand clear on the issue of urban Naxals to the people of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh,” he said.
He exhorted workers in Chhattisgarh to ensure that the party wins more than 65 seats in the 90-member assembly in the state and the Congress is decimated. Anything below the target of 65 seats should not be considered a win, the BJP chief said.
The saffron outfit currently has 49 MLAs in the state, where it has been in power since 2003.
Mocking Gandhi for predicting a Congress win in the three poll-bound states, Shah said, “Rahul baba is dreaming in broad daylight with his eyes open.”
The BJP chief also highlighted the achievements of the Narendra Modi government in the last four years.
“Since 2014 when Narendra Modi became PM, the Congress has lost each and every state election. You (Rahul) ask us what the BJP has done in four-and-a-half years…
“Our government is working for the poor, youth and farmers who were neglected during your family rule. When Pakistan-based terrorists attacked us, (then PM) Manmohan Singh remained quiet. But, under Modi, our security forces conducted surgical strikes after Uri attack,” Shah said."

In a protest against the Uri terror attack, an association of Muslim traders in Vadodara on Sunday decided not to sell or consume various made in Pakistan products such as heena, spices and perfumes.
Muslim Traders’ Association, an unregistered group of Muslims traders in the city, also took out a protest march and burnt made in pakistan products near Mandvi area. They also appealed to other businessmen to join them.

“Made in Pakistan products such as spices, perfumes, maskara, gutkha, soaps and clothes are commonly used in the Muslim families in India. During festival seasons, all these products are consumed in large numbers. We Muslim Traders’ Association of Mandvi have decided that we will not sell or consume any made in Pakistan product,” said Fareed Cutpiecewala, a cloth merchant and Congress councillor of Ward No. 7 in the VMC.
According to Cutpiecewala, their group is of around 150 small and medium retail merchants and all of them have agreed to join hands to boycott Pakistani products.
“We have decided to stop selling various Pakistan made products to mark our protest. Thus, we will make Pakistan weaker economically,” said Imtiaz Attarwala, who runs a perfume shop in Mandvi area.
“I am urging the Central government to ban all products of Pakistan in India and I request all Indians not to buy Pakistani products. This is a small effort from our side, but if we all come together we can teach lesson to Pakistan, which is nurturing terrorism,” added Cutpiecewala."

Congratulating the Army for carrying out a successful anti-terror operation across LoC, BSP supremo Mayawati today said the government should have given a go-ahead for it soon after the Pathankot attack. She also cautioned BJP against trying to go overboard in celebration or taking “electoral advantage” on the issue, saying the situation has also led to new security challenges for the country.
“By demolishing terror camps in LoC, the army has fulfilled the promise made by it to the people of the country after the Uri attack,” Mayawati said in a statement.

“Giving a go-ahead for army action by the Modi government is a right but late move … it should have been done soon after the Pathankot attack in January this year … perhaps it could have saved the lives of 19 jawans in Uri,” she said. The BSP chief also cautioned the Modi government not to get carried away by this.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“This is not the time for the Modi government to either celebrate in over-excitement or make the wrong attempt to take political and electoral advantage on the issue as the present situation has also posed many challenges before the country… there is a need to remain vigilant for security of the country and its citizens,” she said.
“There is an immediate need to secure all international borders especially with Pakistan. This issue has been given very little importance in past two-and-half years resulting in continued terror activities causing loss of lives of civilians and jawans,” she stressed.
The four-time UP chief minister also called for shunning the inconsistent policy of the past in this regard and allowing the army to continue its good work in national interest. Criticising BJP president Amit Shah’s claims of the present scenario as ‘the dawn of new age’, she said it was “politically motivated”.
“A lot needs to be done to secure the borders and lives of people … BJP should not start patting its own back over the developments,” she said.
“Is it not the wrong thinking of the NDA-BJP led central government and PDP-BJP led state government that instead of effectively deploying the army on the borders to check infiltration it was used to keep a watch on its own people in Kashmir,” she asked.
The BSP president called for equipping the army with all kind of modern equipment for securing international borders."

Ahead of the three-day BJP National Council meeting in Kozhikode, party president Amit Shah arrived in the city amid grand reception by BJP workers at the Calicut International Airport, Karipur. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also slated to visit Kozhikode on September 24. A special function is also being organised to mark the centenary year celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay who was elected as the Jan Sangh president in Kozhikode in 1967.
While speaking to Press Trust of India, senior BJP leader V Muraleedharan said, “Upon the Prime Minister’s arrival in the city in the evening, he will address a public meeting being organised as part of the national council.” PM Modi will be attending the meetings on September 24 and 25.
On the third day of the national council meeting, PM Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the birth centenary celebrations of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, former Jan Sangh president, at a special function.

According to reports, almost 1,700 BJP leaders will attend the meeting, including Union ministers, Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states, MPs, MLAs, national leaders and state unit leaders. Reports suggest that the national council meeting would also focus on the Uri attack that claimed the life of 18 soldiers. A senior party leader told PTI, “Obviously there is palpable anger among our workers over the terror attack and they would be looking at the top party brass to send out a message. I am sure the leadership will touch on this issue of national security.”"

(Photo: APH Images)
Actor Ajay Devgn says his latest film Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior does not show any religion in bad light and is about defending the country from foreign invaders.
The Om Raut-directed movie, set in the 17th century, is based on the life of Tanhaji Malusare, the military leader of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s army.
Tanhaji played an instrumental role in taking back the strategic hill fortress of Kondhana from the Mughal empire.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The film’s trailer had raised some eyebrows after Devgn, as Tanhaji, is seen propagating the power of saffron.
Ajay, however, said the film does not portray any religion in negative.
“We are talking about the country. We are talking about freedom. There is no ‘Hindutva’. It is about your nation, your country. In the movie, you will see that there are Muslim warriors who are fighting alongside Tanhaji. We are not fighting for religion. When we talk about country, then there is no religion,” Ajay told PTI in an interview.
When asked about the portrayal of Muslim rulers in films such as Padmaavat and most recently Panipat, the actor said the characterisations were based on historical facts.
“Alauddin Khalji (from ‘Padmaavat’) was barbaric according to history. Not because he was from a certain religion that he was barbaric, he was a barbaric man.
“Let’s take any film about British rule. When we travel outside, do we feel like hurting British people? It was wrong for them to rule us but that story is over now. It is, however, part of the history. So are history books wrong? Are history books talking against Christianity? They are not,” Ajay said.

The actor further said the film’s core theme is about safeguarding the nation from foreigners.
“We are talking about invaders and outsiders in our country at that point of time. People have become one now. It is one country now for everybody. Even before, invaders and outsiders, the country never had just one religion. Everybody was living in peace and harmony. There are names in history of people who fought against their own,” Ajay added.
Director Om Raut also defended the film, saying the film is not against any religion.
“Is it any attempt towards saffronisation? 100 per cent no. It was the colour that was there for the fort and Shivaji’s army and that is where it is. Chhatrapati Shivaji did not believe in any religion. He had people of all religions — hindus and non-hindus — in his army. In his artillery department, there was a ‘topchi’ who was Noor Khan Baig. There were so many non-Hindus who worked under Shivaji.”
The director further said “the war, the struggle and the tension” of the 17th century were not related to any faith in any way.
“It was religion neutral. People happened to be on this side or both side. There were invaders and the war was against them. The Swaraj movement was against the invaders. The people of this land, no matter which religion they belonged to, they fought against the foreign invasion. It was the situation of that time.”
The trailer also branded the movie as a story about Maratha empire’s “surgical strike” on the Mughals also drew criticism. Surgical strike as a term became popular after the Indian Army struck terror launchpads in Pakistan in the aftermath of Uri attack in 2016, an incident that inspired a mainstream movie.
Also read: Kajol: Had no reference point to play Savitribai in Tanhaji
The director, however, said the term of guerrilla warfare has come to be known as surgical strikes today and therefore it is easy to explain the movie’s story to the youth through the phrase.
“It is simpler to understand. If I had said guerrilla activity, nobody would have understand. Maybe some would have understood it. A trailer is an advertisement. If I speak in Marathi or French, will you understand it? No.
“I have to speak your language which is English. It is common to everyone. I say surgical strike, youngsters understand it immediately. They know what it is. If I had said ‘ganimi kava’, which is the scientific name for it, nobody would have understood,” Raut said.
Tanhaji: The Unsung Hero, which also features Saif Ali Khan and Kajol, is scheduled to be released on January 10."

Filmmaker Saket Chaudhary says most of the established actresses in Bollywood are not willing to play the role of a mother on the screen. In his upcoming directorial Hindi Medium, Pakistani actress Saba Qamar features alongside Irrfan Khan as his wife and a mother of a young girl. “You look for a certain person in the actor, who can fit into the character. There are a lot of established actresses who don’t want to play a mother. There was that issue. I had that experience from ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’,” Saket told PTI.
Saket said he faced a similar problem when he was planning for the sequel of Pyaar Ke Side Effects, which released in 2006. The director says the follow up Shaadi Ke Side Effects took him nearly eight years to finalise the female lead as not many actresses were willing to take up the role of a mother in the movie. It was eventually played by Vidya Balan.

“The seven-eight year long gap happened in the film because of series of accidents. There was this whole major casting problem that we were going through which delayed the film. I had faced this problem a lot in casting that film. Vidya was very brave. She wasn’t one of those actresses who has an issue but others did have that. I didn’t want to get into that loop again with ‘Hindi Medium’,” he says.
In Saba, who will be making her Bollywood debut with the film, Saket found traits which were “exactly similar” to what he wanted in the role. However, after the Uri attacks when MNS threatened to stall the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Saket says the film’s team was worried as they were close to finish the shoot.

India on Wednesday said Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s comments describing Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani, whose encounter killing by security forces triggered the current unrest in the Valley, as “son of the Kashmiri soil” shows that country’s attachment to terrorism.
“The speech by Sharif at the joint session of Parliament shows Pakistan’s continued attachment to terrorism,” senior government sources said.

Their remarks came after Sharif, while addressing a joint session of Parliament convened to discuss the security situation in the wake of increasing Indo-Pak tensions, accused India of running away from dialogue and instead creating a war-like environment by blaming Pakistan for the Uri terror attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed last month.
Sharif expressed support for Kashmiris and said the issue should be resolved according to the wishes of people of Kashmir and the UN resolutions.
“The Kashmiri youth have taken it upon themselves to carry on the movement of freedom against Indian aggression and atrocities.

(ANI)
In the aftermath of the Uri attack on September 18, 2016 in which 20 soldiers were killed, all political parties have united and claimed that they stand with the centre.
After the attack in Baramulla late Sunday night, which claimed the life on one BSF jawan, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has iterated the same sentiment and said the whole nation is united on matters related to the border.

“We shouldn’t get so anxious on matters related to border. The whole nation is united. The Indian Army has enough power to handle it,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Kumar said that in such matters, differing political ideologies were not going to help and that his party is with the centre in this situation.
“The decision of surgical strike taken by the Centre is successful,” Kumar told reporters emerging from a function on

wild life week here.
In reply to a question on terrorists making a bid to attack an army camp in Baramulla, the national president of

JD(U) said “such activities keep happening on borders” and “there was no need to panic”.
Everybody knows that the Union Government is making full-proof arrangements to deal with such elements, he said.

“Our Army and Paramilitary personnel who are deployed at the borders have the strength to deal with such situation,” Kumar said.
“It is wrong to think that all terror activities will end, it is not possible. We should always remain alert to deal with

such elements,” he said.
“In matters related to terrorism, contradictory political views won’t help. We are with the Centre. All the necessary steps are being taken,” the Bihar CM said.
Nitish Kumar had, after the surgical strikes, congratulated the government on Twitter for the decisive action against terrorism.

While Pakistan has raised the Kashmir issue at the high-level segments of the General Assembly and other UN platforms in previous years, Sharif appears set to take an even more aggressive stand on Kashmir at the world body, having vowed in Pakistan to ’emphatically highlight’ the issue and the alleged human rights abuses by India.
“Pakistan will continue to extend moral, diplomatic and political support to Kashmiris,” Sharif had said last week, alleging that atrocities in Kashmir had touched extremes.
Last year Sharif, raising the Kashmir issue in the General Assembly, had proposed a four-point ‘peace initiative’ with India on Kashmir.
In a strong response, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had said in her address that India does not need four points but just one that Pakistan should ‘give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk’.
The UNGA session comes at a time when tensions between the two nations have risen following the Uri attack in which the heavily-armed four militants stormed the battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in the wee hours of Sunday, killing 18 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel.
Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Ranbir Singh has said that the terrorists had certain items that confirm their Pakistani identity.
Swaraj will address the General Assembly on September 26 and a sharp response is expected from her to Sharif’s rhetoric on Kashmir."

(File Photo)
Amid the heightened tension at the border after the mutilation of the bodies of two Indian soldiers, the Shiv Sena on Friday said merely angry rhetoric against Pakistan was not enough and it needed to be “crushed” now. In a scathing editorial in the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana,’ the Sena also said despite India having given substantial proof to Pakistan over Hafiz Saeed’s involvement in the 26/11 terror attack, the Pathankot airbase attack, the Uri attack and the recent beheading of two jawans, the neighbouring country has shirked all its responsibility.
It is poking fun instead at India saying we have a habit of blaming Pakistan for everything that happens here, it added. “This is going on for many years now. Everybody knows that the ISI, the Pakistani military and the terror outfits based there are behind the terror attacks in India,” the Sena mouthpiece said.
“Despite throwing ample proof on their face each time, the terrorism emanating from Pakistan and violence in Kashmir has refused to cease. The banks are being looted in the valley and the soldiers are being killed. But the government only summons (high commissioner of Pakistan to India) Abdul Basit, gives him proof against his nation and lets him off with a warning,” it said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It said the nation is tired of hearing about the revenge that will be taken against Pakistan. “The anguish of the families of the martyred soldiers numbs all senses. Had the families of the martyred jawans been called when Basit was summoned to the External Affairs Ministry, they would have peeled his skin off. He would not be able to smile in front of the mediapersons then,” it said.
“The continuous use of words like shameless for Pakistan will not be enough now. It needs to be crushed. The country was expecting 50 heads (of the Pakistani soldiers) for every Indian killed. But here, it seems that revenge is only taken by summoning Basit and warning him,” the Sena said."

Sajid Khan is dead sure where his loyalties lie when it comes to India. Like Nana Patekar, Sajid too chose to put his country first and support India to the hilt when it comes to banning Pakistani actors from India in the aftermath of Uri attack.
Speaking at the launch of his chat show, Yaaron Ki Baraat, Sajid when asked about the political call to ban Pakistani actors said, “We have to respect our nation. We are proud Indians and I am with my country. If our country and government thinks they (Pakistani actors) have to go back then they should. India comes first for me.”
Bollywood as a whole still remains divided on the issue of Pakistani actors. While few have opined that actors from across the border should issue strong statements condemning terrorist attacks, others have vociferously protest against the ban. Radhika Apte recently expressed that banning Pakistani actors is not the solution. “Pakistani actors should also be allowed to come here and do films in India. I don’t think they should be banned,” the actress opined.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
majority of Bollywood continues to support Pakistani artists, throwing their weight behind them and demanding to know how slapping of a ban would stop terrorism. After Karan Johar, Salman Khan too spoke out in favour of Pakistani artistes delinking them from terrorism and terrorists. “They come here on valid visas given by our government. They are artistes not terrorists,” said Khan.
Earlier, Nana Patekar had also voiced sentiments similar to Sajid Khan. The veteran actor opined that artistes are like bugs in front of the nation. “My country comes first for me.” Nana also indirectly trolled Salman for speaking out in favour of Pakistani artists."

OVER FIVE months after they were arrested for their alleged involvement in the attack on an army camp in Uri, two Pakistani teenagers were handed over to the Pakistani authorities at the Wagah border on Friday. Faisal Husain Awan, a resident of Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and his school-friend Ahsan Khursheed, from Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil, were arrested by the Indian Army on September 21, three days after the Uri attack which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers.
Earlier this week, the National Investigation Agency informed a court that it had no evidence to prosecute them.

The Indian Express had, in December, first published evidence suggesting the two were Class X students at the Shaheen Model School in Muzaffarabad who had accidentally strayed across the Line of Control, and were not terrorists.

 
“We are happy. It always feels great when one returns home after such a long time. We are very happy,” said Khursheed, before he crossed the border Friday. The two boys waited for about an hour for the paperwork to be completed, before being received by the Pakistani authorities on the other side.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

A PTI report quoted Awan’s father as saying, “I am extremely happy to see my son among us. I am thankful to the governments of Pakistan and India for the safe release of my son.” He said the families of both the boys had suffered extreme mental pain after they were arrested in India. Awan’s brother, Abdul Mustafa, said Awan would now go back to school and continue his studies. “At times we lost hope of seeing Awan among us. We are thankful to God, both governments and the media,” he said, according to the PTI report.
What Else Making News

Days after their arrest, an Army spokesperson had said the two were “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir nationals who have been working for Jaish-e-Muhammad terror outfit”. In an e-mail to The Indian Express, the Army had said this determination was based on what it described as “spot interrogation”. The boys were named in an Indian government dossier as having facilitated the “infiltration of a group of four Jaish-e-Muhammad cadre who carried out the Uri army camp attack”.
In its press note, the NIA said: “Investigation carried out by the NIA revealed that the two suspects had crossed over to the Indian side after altercation with their parents due to pressure of studies. Evidence collected in the form of statements, technical analysis of their mobile phones, seized GPS devices and other circumstantial evidence collected by NIA did not reveal any linkage of the suspects with the attackers at Uri. Further investigation is continuing in the case.”

Both juveniles, sources familiar with the investigation said, offered varying testimonies confessing their guilt in the first days after being handed over to the NIA, some throwing up disturbing evidence of coercion. In one statement to a woman doctor working for the Central Reserve Police Force, the two claimed that they had participated in the attack itself, providing details of how incendiary substances were used to set the tents at the 12 Brigade on fire.
Then, in an October 3 statement, the NIA claimed Awan identified one of the four slain terrorists who attacked the 12 Brigade headquarters as Hafiz Ahmad, who he said was the son of Feroze, in the village of Dharbang, west of Murree. Later, however, the NIA said that it was the Lashkar-e-Taiba which was behind the attack — not, as initially claimed, the Jaish-e-Muhammad — based, in part, on Global Positioning System data retrieved from a set used by one of the attackers and cipher-matrixes they used. The Muridke-based terrorist group had held funeral rites for one of the attackers, as first reported by this newspaper."

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday said the government is “serious” about punishing those responsible for the deadly Uri attack as it will “not sleep over” terror being pushed into India from across the border.
He also dismissed reports about Pakistan’s threat of use of tactical nukes, saying that “empty vessel makes bigger noise” and asserted that steps will be taken to ensure that incidents like Uri strike are not repeated.

“We take proper reading of everything and I don’t think Prime Minister’s initial words that ‘those responsible will be punished’, will go as a mere statement. How to punish, that is for us to work out. We are quite serious about it,” Parrikar said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He was responding to questions about what India’s response to the attack will be.
To a question on reports about Pakistan’s threat of use of tactical nuclear weapons, Parrikar said the person who has strength, usually makes less noise.
“Empty vessel makes bigger noise. This country is a very responsible power, but that does not mean I will sleep over this kind of terrorism that is being pushed from across. How do I do it is entirely for the government under the Prime Minister, to decide,” he said.
Parrikar said, “Obviously something must have been wrong. I will not go into detail of it. Obviously it is a very sensitive matter.
“When something goes wrong, while you try to correct it, you should also ensure that it does not happen again. We will definitely find out what went wrong and also take steps to ensure it does not go wrong again. Country needs to ensure that repetition of wrong does not repeat again and again,” he said.

The usage of ‘nationalism’ term in present times carries the connotations of “Nazism” and “Stalinism”, BJP MP Tarun Vijay said. Speaking at a session on ‘National ideologies and their effect on global politics’ at the Kumaon Literature Festival (KLF) here yesterday, Vijay noted that the term ‘nationalism’ was synonymous with notorious historical figures of Mussolini and Hitler and its present usage appears to have its genesis in the days of Nazis and Stalin.

“The word nationalism itself is a condemned word. So, I do not say nationalism. I say dharma of my country, which is its fragrance and soul,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP had passed a resolution in March saying, “Nationalism, national unity and integrity are an article of faith of the BJP.”
The party has also sought to grab the ‘nationalist space’ in the recent past amid raging debates over returning of awards by intellectuals, the JNU row and the PoK surgical strikes. The BJP MP from Uttarakhand said the word ‘ideology’ was a “communist construct”, earning a few sniggers from the audience.

“I do not accept that ‘ideology’ is an Indian construct. It is a western construct, a leftist, communist construct. They wanted to frame everything within their four walls.

The Indian Army has denied any such reports that say Uri Brigade Commander K Somashanker has been ‘shifted out’  in relation to Uri attacks in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18.
Earlier, PTI had reported that Uri Brigade Commander K Sonashanker had been ‘shifted out’ of the sensitive brigade. Four Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists had attacked the rear facility of army brigade headquarters in Uri killing 19 Indian soldiers. One soldier succumbed to his injuries on Friday.

Meanwhile, India carried out surgical strikes along LoC attacking six to eight terrorist launch pads. Since then there has been an escalation in tension between both the countries and villages in Punjab within 10 km range from LoC have been evacuated.
On Friday, families of martyred soldiers welcomed the move by Indian government and army and said that ‘martyrdom of their kin was honored’."

(Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)
In an essay on threats to freedom of expression in your new book, Democrats and Dissenters, you point out that the political class has never stood up for freedom of speech. Why is it that politicians find it unprofitable to espouse it? Is it then, as is often accused, just an elitist concern?

Throughout the freedom movement, because there were curbs on freedom of speech imposed by the British — newspapers were often fined, sometimes banned, editors were arrested—there were continuous promises made by nationalists that when we become free, we would have freedom of speech. Gandhi said famously in Young India in 1921 that when we are free, we would remove the sedition law. He also gave a definition of freedom of speech, which says unless you explicitly advocate violence, whatever you say [should not be proscribed.]
Why do Indian politicians not support it? Like many other betrayals of the ideals of the founding figures, this is one. Indian politics is increasingly become instrumental. It is now merely about winning elections. In fact, you are told, Modi has won for five years, you cannot criticize him. Or Mamata has won for five years, you cannot criticize her. But democracy is a process of continuous introspection, questioning and reform. This is a part of the degeneration of the Indian democracy into an elections-only democracy.
Do you think it reflects on the people as well, that we have not demanded it of our politicians that they protect our freedom?

Writers and intellectuals are also complicit. Too few of them are also non-aligned. I criticized Sahmat about not speaking up for Taslima Nasreen in West Bengal. The RSS will say we are in favour of protecting Salman Rushdie’s freedom of speech, and not Perumal Murugan or MF Husain’s. I don’t think the people are to blame. PEN is an organization that stands for freedom of expression. India, the largest democracy, does not have a single unit. There is clearly something wrong with us as writers and intellectuals that we cannot work across party lines or beliefs. Often, the Left is as guilty as the right — if you go back to the 1970s, the way Nurul Hasan behaved, the way liberal intellectuals were marginalized from ICSSR, ICHR, or vice-chancellorships, if you look at the conduct of the CPM in Calcutta University, which was destroyed by promoting only CPM intellectuals.

https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Do you see the first amendment to the Constitution in 1951 then as the start of the slide?

That was a bad precedent. It should have been undone by the late 1950s, when India was secure and not going to Balkanise. It was a failure of Nehru.
You are even-handed in blaming the BJP and the Congress when it comes to not defending the right to speech. But do you not see a difference in the way the two parties and their politics work in this respect?

[Yes] on intellectual work, generally, and not just on freedom of expression. The BJP is far more ideologically driven, and its standards are much lower. Academic posts, from the Congress onwards, have become instruments of patronage. So the best person is not appointed, say, as director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, but the second or the third best person is because she/he is seen as more compliant to the first family. But with the BJP, it is the 20th or 30th best person. It is a party hostile to creative work, intellectual work, to thinking, to reflection. It is a profoundly anti-intellectual and Philistine party. Look at the statements our culture minister makes. Institutions that have been built up painstakingly-the ASI, the National Museum, the NGMA– are steadily being undermined. This government [is guily], more than the Vajpayee government. Because Vajpayee somewhere he believed that the arts, culture and scholarship mattered. This government does not think they matter. Economic growth and military might matter. That’s it.
In your essay comparing the insurgencies in Kashmir and Sri Lanka, you say the “Indian arrogance towards Kashmiris have been at times so brutal and extreme as to make reasoned and non-violent protest…perhaps impossible.” How do you see the recent uprising in Kashmir?

I think it is the gravest situation we have faced in Kashmir in many years. It’s partly the accumulation of mistakes made by previous governments. The movement for azaadi in Kashmir is increasingly inflected by Islamic fundamentalism. Today, again there is a rise of Hindu fundamentalism in India. Maybe there are wise heads in the government who want to reach out to Kashmir. But that is undermined by the activities on the ground by the Sangh Parivar, who are not fringe elements. Gau raksha now is a part of official policy in Haryana and Maharashtra, as your own paper has reported. Social media has [broadcast the] horrific images of the pellet gun injuries and, the excesses of the Indian security forces are known everywhere in the rest of India. In Bangalore in the 1990s, I had no clue of what the army was doing. Kashmir gets to see images of the flogging of Muslims and Dalits on the issue of cow. And a Kashmiri Muslim says Muslims are not safe in India and is pushed further towards the jihadis. What was a movement for autonomy, dignity and self-respect becomes a movement for Islamic pride. Let’s be clear: Burhan Wani died for Allah, not for Kashmir. It’s a very tricky and complicated situation where the two fundamentalisms reinforce and fuel each other.
And how to move towards solving this? The first step would be for the Prime Minister and the RSS to say that we completely disavow our past positions on Article 370. It will stay and it is inviolate. In fact, we will find ways of making it more effective so that Kashmirirs have more autonomy. That is the basic minimum that has to be done to retrieve the situation. It is a complicated situation which needs sagacious statesmanship. But some of the remarks by this government after the Uri attack–what Ram Madhav said–was appalling. If Arnab Goswami was to say that, it was fine. If a BJP affiliated journalist were to say it in the Pioneer, it was fine. But for the general secretary of the party responsible for Kashmir to make such a crude and irresponsible statement shows the unwisdom in the government.
How do you look upon the extraordinary fast of Irom Sharmila which just ended? How has the Indian state come off in this encounter?

It is linked to something common in Kashmir and Manipur, which is the ceding of control of civilian authorities to the army. Hence AFSPA, hence immunity. It is a commentary on how our policy in these border areas is dominated by military considerations. Coming back to Kashmir, when Omar Abdullah said withdraw AFSPA in a few districts and keep it in the border areas if you will, why did the Congress government at the Centre not agree? That could have set a precedent in the border areas, which could have been applied in Manipur. These are mistakes we are still paying for.

The epigraph to your book is a quote by Benedict Anderson: “No one can be a true nationalist who is incapable of feeling ashamed of her [or his] government commits crimes, including those against their fellow citizens.” How do you look at this recent debate on being anti-national?

The nationalism of Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar was inflected by a sense of shame. They were ashamed at our treatment of women and Dalits. Indian nationalism as conceived by them was a work in progress. It was not flawless, it was always imperfect. And the attempt would be to always strive to correct these imperfections. As opposed to a nationalism that says: “India is great”, “India is perfect”, “mera bharat mahaan”, “Bharat mata ki jai” or “worship the flag”. The idea that there should be a 207 foot high flag in every central university which you can see from everywhere and it will make you proud is utterly farcical. It is a nationalism of insecurity and paranoia parading as a nationalism of might and self-confidence.
How do you see the JNU debate in this light? What did it achieve and what did it cede?

Personally, I think the JNU debate is not as important to someone living in Bangalore. It was covered because the media is in Delhi.
No, because there were sedition cases slapped on students for shouting slogans.

Sedition cases have been slapped elsewhere also. It, of course, was a mistake. It was an excessive, knee-jerk reaction of the state. Its importance, for good or for ill, was magnified because the media is here. It is easier to cover something in JNU and not go elsewhere.
The protests at Hyderabad University were also covered.

Hyderabad was covered for a different reason. It was more important, there was clear victimization there. But I didn’t follow the JNU debate very carefully. I do think that to reclaim a nationalism that is reflective and interrogative is important for the Left and liberals. It has allowed the right and the RSS to say: only we are patriotic, only we are nationalists.
I was recently reading JP on Kashmir. Here is a leader the Sangh Parivar respects. He thinks that our treatment of Kashmir is a black mark on Indian democracy, which it is. Arnab Goswami would call this hero anti-national. He says. ‘How long can we hide the facts on Kashmir?’ ‘To suppress the Kashmiris by force’, he says, ‘is a suicide of the soul of India’. Leaders like JP truly loved the country, they wanted to reform it. They were fearless in criticizing its failings. They had a sense of shame. But they were nationalists.
Do you still believe that the Congress needs to be Gandhi-mukt?

That was my belief till recently, till about a year ago. That it needs to rid of the Gandhis. But now I think the Congress is dead. It is terminally ill. It’s done what it has to do and it should now die. And Indians will find a way to occupy that political space.
The RSS has spoken of reviewing the Constitution. What do you think of that idea?

It was there in the last BJP government. Vajpayee’s government appointed a “Constitution review committee” because the RSS was saying it had to reexamined. They appointed as the chairman of the committee a man called MN Venkatachaliah, a former chief justice of India, from my home town Bangalore. He was a devout Hindu in his personal life, who did puja twice a day. He came to Delhi, got a Lutyens bungalow for two years of his term. They must have thought that because of his personal, spiritual leanings, this man would be inclined to the RSS point of view. He consulted scholars across the board, specialists, legal scholars, and basically wrote a report saying nothing needs to be done to the Constitution. The RSS didn’t want to hear that, but maybe Vajpayee did. He could be quite clever that way."

Attacking Congress for its demand to convene a special session of Parliament to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, BJP today said it’s merely a propaganda tactic of the opposition party and an attempt to politicise the issue of national security. The ruling party said the Congress’ decision to go to media with its demand shows it’s not serious and added that it should have gone to the Lok Sabha Speaker if it was sincere.
“If Congress is serious about it, then the right thing would have been to go to the Speaker. Rather they have gone to the media to politicise the issue of national interest and for propaganda. It shows their non-serious attitude,” BJP’s National Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh said.

“The government is looking at diplomatic, economic and military options and in that ambit it will consider all options and take appropriate step. It is not for us to comment but to stand with the government when it takes a decision,” he told reporters here.
Reacting to Congress’ jibe that the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status given to Pakistan, which is being reviewed, is a “dead letter”, he said the “dead UPA government” sat over the so-called dead letter for years.
He also attacked Congress for its alleged inaction following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.
He asked Congress and other parties to stand with the government, saying moments come in the history of every country when entire nation needs to stand together.
“Such a moment has arrived for India when all people should stand together,” he said."

Pakistan on Thursday rejected allegations of its involvement in the assault on an army camp in Uri town in Kashmir that killed at least 18 soldiers, saying it has “nothing to gain” from this attack.
Such incidents are part of the “Indian attempt to divert attention of the world community” from Kashmir, Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria said at the weekly briefing here.

“Pakistan has nothing to gain from this attack…It has become Indian habit to point accusing fingers at Pakistan after every such incident in India,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India has told Pakistan that it has evidence showing involvement of Pakistan based terrorists in the Uri attack and demanded that Islamabad refrain from supporting and sponsoring terrorism directed against this country.
Zakaria said the entire nation was ready to defend the country in case of any attack by India after the Uri incident.
To a question on airspace restrictions over northern part of the country, he said that Pakistan Air Force was carrying out routine exercises which are not linked to the prevailing security situation.
He claimed that Pakistan “has concrete evidence of Indian sponsored terrorism in various areas including Balochistan and Karachi, which had been proved by the arrest and confession of RAW agent Kulbhushan Yadev”.
“The recent statement of Indian Prime Minister was yet another proof of Indian involvement in terrorism and terror financing in Pakistan aimed at destabilizing the country,” he said.
The spokesperson said that the request by Baloch leader Brahmdagh Bugti to seek asylum in India “only confirms that India was deeply involved in terrorism in Balochistan”.
He said Pakistan is a peaceful country and peaceful neighbourhood is the vision of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who has demanded the UN to implement its resolutions on Kashmir.
Zakaria alleged that India security forces were continuing “brutalities” in Kashmir and asked the UN Secretary-General, UN Human Rights Commissioner and international community to take measures to stop the violence."

The New Development Bank formed by the BRICS nations last year plans to more than double its commitment to support infrastructure projects to the tune of USD 2.5 billion in 2017, its president KV Kamath said on Sunday. “We are targeting incremental lending of USD 2.5 billion over next year and we believe it will be largely in the sustainable and green infrastructure,” Kamath said at the BRICS Business Council as part of the two-day summit of the BRICS leaders.

Keeping the commitments and the actual lending in mind, NDB has drawn up a plan to raise USD 1.5 billion from multiple sources next year, said the noted banker, who built ICICI Bank into the second largest lender in the country in a span of a decade.
While expanding the lending activities, Kamath said the bank will seek to reduce the cost of borrowing for the member-countries by doing local currency borrowings which does not require any hedging.

It has already done 3 billion yuan (USD 450 million) in China, as part of a Beijing-approved plan to raise 10 billion yuans in the medium-term, he said, adding it will adopt a similar strategy in other markets as well.
India, where it has committed up to USD 250 million already, will be among the first countries where it plans to raise money in local currency, Kamath said, adding that a rupee bond issue will be done in the first half of next year.
The Shanghai-headquartered bank is also ramping up its staff and plans to take the head count to 350 over the next three years from the present 60, Kamath said.
Work on creating a centre in South Africa is on track and it will be opening this quarter itself, Kamath said.

Independent Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Friday introduced a private member’s bill to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. “I had promised that I will do this after the September 18 Uri attack. The reason behind the bill is to put the spotlight on the need for India to take a strong view on Pakistan as a terror state. The main objective is to urge the government to take appropriate action to brand Pakistan a terrorist nation,” Chandrasekhar told IANS.

‘The Declaration Of Countries as Sponsor of Terrorism Bill’ states that “Pakistan propagates and harbours agents of international terror who have repeatedly attacked the territory and people of our country… (It) poses a continual risk to the peace and security of the region”.
The bill also provides for imposing legal, economic and travel sanctions on citizens of the neighbouring country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The bill seeks to prohibit citizens of such country, which is declared a terror state, including its Head of the State, from travelling in India. It also asks for prohibition on trade, receiving or making grants, financial remittances, investments and assets along with maritime activities and overflight over India.
The bill states that immunity of officials of such countries shall be revoked and they shall not be offered immunity from any legal case in India."

It is held up as an example of a global model of cooperation between countries.
Amid the clamour for avenging the Uri attack, a non-military option being suggested — including by Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha (The Indian Express, September 22) — is the abrogation of the 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty that defines the water-sharing arrangement for six rivers of the Indus basin that flow through both India and Pakistan. The argument is that India, being upstream, can stop the flow of waters to Pakistan and bring it to its knees.
Pakistan’s dependence on the Indus system cannot be overstated. About 65% of its geographical area, including the entire Punjab province, is part of the Indus basin. The country has the world’s largest canal irrigation system, thanks to its development of the basin, which accounts for more than 90% of its irrigated area. Its three biggest dams, and several smaller ones, are located here. These are sources for hydroelectricity, irrigation and drinking water for millions of Pakistanis. If the tap could indeed be turned off from the Indian side, Pakistan’s capitulation is expected to be swift.

Indus Waters Treaty
In stark contrast to their dealings in other matters, India and Pakistan have managed their shared river waters quite amicably, thanks to the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. The Treaty has survived wars and innumerable phases of frosty relations. So much so, it is cited as the global model for cooperation on the use of trans-boundary river waters. The success of the Treaty also lends weight to the theory that when it comes to water, nations tend to cooperate rather than get into a conflict.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Treaty, which came after a decade of World Bank-brokered negotiations, classified the six rivers of the Indus system into ‘eastern’ and ‘western’ rivers. Sutlej, Beas and Ravi were eastern; Jhelum, Chenab and Indus itself were western. The categorisation was relative — the western rivers flow almost parallely to the west of the eastern ones. Indus, the largest river, originates in China, so does the Sutlej. The other four rise in India; all enter Pakistan from India.
The Treaty gave India full rights over the waters of the eastern rivers, while it had to let the western rivers flow “unrestricted” to Pakistan. India could use the waters of western rivers as well, but only in a “non-consumptive” manner. It could use it for domestic purposes, and even for irrigation and hydropower production, but only in the manner specified in the Treaty. With the eastern rivers, India could do as it pleased.

A Permanent Indus Commission was established to implement the Treaty. Each country has an Indus Commissioner, and they meet regularly — every six months these days — to exchange information and data, and to settle minor disputes. Meetings of the Indus Commissioners have never been suspended — more than 110 rounds of meetings, held alternately in India and Pakistan, have taken place so far.

Armtwisting through Indus
The idea that India can armtwist Pakistan through the Indus Waters Treaty is not new. It has been floated every time relations have soured between the two countries. It is seen as the easiest and most effective option, and the one with practically no collateral damage. But there is no evidence to suggest it has been given any serious thought, even during the Kargil war or Operation Parakram, the two most serious standoffs in the last couple of decades.
That is because not everyone believes it would help India in achieving its desired objective — that of forcing Islamabad to act on cross-border terrorism.
“It would be detrimental to India’s interests in the long run. There is already strong discomfort in Pakistan with the fact that India controls its rivers. This despite the fact that India has always complied with the provisions of the Treaty. In fact, the eagerness in a section of Pakistani society to wrest Kashmir originates in the desire to take control of its rivers. Any tinkering with the Treaty is likely to see an intensification of Pak-backed activities in J&K,” said Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, head of the Earth Sciences Department at Kashmir University in Srinagar.
Romshoo pointed out that river waters cannot be stopped or released at the turn of a switch. “Waters cannot be immediately stopped from flowing to Pakistan unless we are ready to inundate our own cities. Srinagar, Jammu and every other city in the state and in Punjab would get flooded if we somehow were able to prevent the waters from flowing into Pakistan,” he said.
Uttam Sinha of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses said Pakistan could be pressured even without stopping the waters or violating any other provisions of the Indus Treaty.
“We have never used our rights on the western rivers. Under the Treaty, we can make use of the waters of the western rivers for irrigation, storage, and even for producing electricity, in the manner specified. If we just do what we are entitled to under the Treaty, it would be enough to send jitters through Pakistan. It would be a strong signal without doing anything drastic,” Sinha said.
Indeed, the Treaty allows India to construct storage up to 3.6 million acre feet on the western rivers. But India has developed no storage capacities; nor has it utilised the water it is entitled to for irrigation.
Sinha also argued for India’s greater engagement with Afghanistan on the development of the Kabul river that flows into Pakistan through the Indus basin. “This again can make Pakistan extremely nervous. It is in our strategic interest in any case to enhance our engagement on developmental issues with Afghanistan,” he said.
Stopping the waters of the Indus rivers, on the other hand, can be counterproductive, Sinha said. “We have water-sharing arrangements with other neighbours as well. Not honouring the Indus Treaty would make them uneasy and distrustful. And we would lose our voice if China, decides to do something similar.”"

In an interview to indianexpress.com, actor Vicky Kaushal had said that Uri: The Surgical Strike revolves more around the Indian army’s planning and execution of the strike rather than the politics behind it. And the Aditya Dhar directorial, thankfully, does that and hence gets it right.
The patriotic thriller, starring Kaushal in the role of an army officer, tells the real-life story of how the army and Indian intelligence forces planned the surgical strike on Pakistani terrorists in September 2016 as a retaliation to the Uri attack.
Uri is definitely one of the most stylish and stunningly shot mission-based Indian films. It stands out for its superbly executed combat scenes (special mention to the director of photography, Mitesh Mirchandani).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Performance by the cast is what provides the able support to the vision of Aditya Dhar, who makes an impactful debut with the film.
Vicky Kaushal, who leads the pack, stands tall as an officer, who wears aggression only on the battleground and is otherwise a man who is not afraid to show his emotions. This is a refreshing departure from the stereotyped brooding and chest-thumping Bollywood army officers. Some of the emotional scenes, in particular, are testimony to Vicky’s depth as a performer.
Also impressive, albeit in a small role, is actor Mohit Raina in his big screen debut. The actor looks the part of a sincere army officer, who is always ready to lead the charge and also comfortably take a step back to make space for others to come to the front.
Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam, Kirti Kulhari and Manasi Parekh also do justice to their parts. Drama in the story, however, is missable and makes you want to see more of the action, which on the other hand, thrills as long as it lasts."

While Punjab Police claims to have cracked the grenade attack on Nirankari Satsang Bhawan in Amritsar on Sunday as the handiwork of ISI-backed Khalistani forces in Pakistan, the Centre had, after the attack, ordered a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into last month’s arrest of three Kashmiri students from an engineering college in Jalandhar.
The students — Zahid Gulzar, Yasir Rafiq Bhat and Mohd Idris Shah — were alleged to be members of Zakir Musa’s outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH), and officials said the terror outfit’s pan-network requires detailed investigation.
While ordering transfer of the probe to NIA, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) stated in its order, “Central Government has received information regarding registration of FIR number 166 on October 10, 2018 at police station Sadar, Jalandhar, Punjab, under Sections 121, 121A, 120B of IPC, Sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, Arms Act and Explosive Substances Act relating to arrest of 3 Kashmiri youths for their involvement in terrorist activities.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An NIA team will soon take over the investigation and question the three suspects arrested by Punjab Police, officials said.
Punjab Police had claimed to have seized two weapons, including an assault rifle, and explosives during its raid from the hostel room of a student identified as Zahid, a B.Tech (Civil) student. Gulzar was detained along with Shah and Bhatt. Two of them were pursuing B.Tech and the third was a B.Sc student, it was informed.
An MHA official said the trio’s questioning has revealed attempts by AGuH to recruit more youths.
Officials said Bhatt is related to Zakir Musa, and that further raised suspicion on AGuH’s plans to spread its base outside Jammu and Kashmir, and of efforts by Pakistan’s ISI to expand the arc of militancy on India’s western border. Investigations have also thrown leads that the module has links with Jaish-e-Mohammad, the terror group responsible for the Pathankot and Uri attacks, sources said.
The grenade blast in Amritsar on Sunday was initially suspected to be the work of AGuH after posters on Musa’s possible movement in the state came up, but Punjab Police ruled it out.
Musa, according to J&K Police, is a former Hizbul Mujahideen militant who broke away to form AGuH, which is suspected to be affiliated to the Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). Musa had released a video clip in 2016, threatening to chop off the heads of Hurriyat leaders and advocated establishing Islamic law in Kashmir. As per the assessment of central intelligence agencies, he has recruited nearly two dozen youths from the Valley.
It may be recalled that Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had, a few months ago, cautioned the Centre on multiple attempts to revive extremism in the border state. During meetings with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, he had sought a comprehensive strategy to deal with “re-emergence of extremism”."

BRICS nations on Sunday pitched for a stronger global commitment for combating corruption and repatriation of blackmoney in overseas jurisdictions, saying these along with aggressive tax practices hurt equitable development and economic growth. “We will strive to coordinate our approach… and encourage a stronger global commitment to prevent and combat corruption on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other relevant international legal instruments,” said the Goa declaration issued at the end of the two-day summit of the BRICS leaders Benaulim.

BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) nations acknowledged that corruption, including illicit money and financial flows, and ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign jurisdictions is a global challenge which may impact negatively on economic growth and sustainable development. The BRICS nations stated in the declaration that they support the strengthening of international cooperation against corruption, including through the BRICS Anti-Corruption Working Group, as well as on matters related to asset recovery and persons sought for corruption.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The five nations group reaffirmed their commitment towards a globally fair and modern tax system and welcome the progress made on effective and widespread implementation of the internationally agreed standards. They supported the implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (BEPS) with due regard to the national realities of the countries.
They also resolved to encourage countries and International Organisations to assist developing economies in building their tax capacity. Noting that aggressive tax planning and tax practices hurt equitable development and economic growth, they stated that the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting must be effectively tackled.
They said that the profit should be taxed in the jurisdiction where the economic activity is performed and the value is created. They reaffirmed their commitment to support international cooperation in this regard, including in the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Tax Information (AEOI). “We note the ongoing discussions on international taxation matters. In this regard, we recall the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development including its emphasis on inclusive cooperation and dialogue among national tax authorities on international tax matters with increased participation of developing countries and reflecting adequate, equitable, geographical distribution, representing different tax systems,” it added."

Saying that the days of “restraint” are over, two senior BJP leaders on Sunday advocated “for one tooth, the complete jaw” policy in J&K. Not doing so would be “cowardice”, Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh, MP from Udhampur in Jammu, said. “The PM has promised that those behind the Uri terror attack will not go unpunished. That should be the way forward. For one tooth, the complete jaw,” Ram Madhav, the BJP general secretary in-charge of party affairs in J&K, posted on his Facebook page.
Calling the Uri attack “a disturbing moment and a moment of introspection”, Singh said, “I am not one bit in favour of responding with cowardice… There is no other option but to punish those behind this dastardly act.” Both Madhav and Singh refrained from naming Pakistan.

The Union minister said the nation could never repay the jawans for their sacrifices. “It is time for all of us to put our heads together and devise a strategy. I feel shattered over the loss of 17 lives of our brave soldiers.” Asserting that “the days of so-called strategic restraint are over”, Madhav said, “If terrorism is the instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise.”"

The terror attack in Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF men, followed by the IAF’s aerial strikes on Balakot, have led to an increase in tension between India and Pakistan. A 1984-batch Indian Foreign Service officer, Gautam Bambawale was India’s High Commissioner to Pakistan in 2016 and 2017. He was in office when India undertook surgical strikes following the terrorist attack in Uri, and when Kulbhushan Jadhav was captured by Pakistan. Bambawale was India’s ambassador to China in 2018, and handled the Wuhan Summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping following the Doklam stand-off
Former ambassador to China and ex-high commissioner to Pakistan Gautam Bambawale says the message from the recent air strike on Balakot is that India can undertake such an exercise “successfully”, insists there is “no deep-seated hatred” between Indians and Pakistanis, and explains why, on listing of Masood Azhar as a terrorist, India needs to be “transactional” with China.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: What does the decision to conduct air strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan mean?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pakistan has been following a policy of bleeding India by a thousand cuts. That policy is of aiding, abetting and sponsoring terrorism directed at India. We have had terrorist incidents for almost 35-40 years, not only in Jammu and Kashmir but all over India. This is a low-cost strategy for the Pakistanis.
With the (surgical strikes) for the first time in 2016, and now again in 2019, what we have indicated is that the people of India have had it up to their necks in suffering from terrorist activities. Also, we have indicated — and the government can take credit for the bold and brave decision — that if Pakistan will not control terrorists, then we will go and strike them inside Pakistan. That is what has changed. A lot of people are describing it as a new template that has been brought to the table. I agree with that assessment. It is no one’s case that one surgical strike, or one aerial strike, would force Pakistan to stop aiding and abetting terrorism. But we have increased and raised the costs for them to do this.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: We did not incur any casualties in the air strikes, but in such situations, things can go wrong. Were we prepared for that?
There is no doubt that it was a risky operation. But a lot of people in India are now saying that look, if Pakistan is not going to stop aiding and abetting terrorism, then we must take our own steps. These people are asking questions of our government. I think this government has only answered those questions by undertaking the surgical strikes of 2016 and the aerial strikes of 2019. I am sure the people in the government would have considered all the action-reaction scenarios, and only after assessing them would have decided to go ahead with it.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: You were India’s High Commissioner to Pakistan when the surgical strikes were carried out by ground troops in 2016. How did you engage with the Pakistanis at the time? 
The situation then was slightly different from what it is now. When the surgical strikes took place, the Pakistanis decided to deny it. And then they were not forced to react to it either. Regarding the decision to carry out those strikes, there were a number of options on the table. I cannot reveal the details, but I am very confident that the same options, maybe a few more, were on the table this time as well.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5618720 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg"" alt="""" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/gautam-bambawale.jpg-1.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> “(Before surgical strikes) Then foreign secy said something was building up… He asked me to prepare… When strikes took place, we spent four days locked down in a safe place at the High Commission in Pak,” said Bambawale.
Much before the surgical strikes took place, and may be even before the attack on Uri, I had a long chat with the then foreign secretary, S Jaishankar, during one of my visits to New Delhi in 2016. One of the things he told me was that there was something building up. He said he did not know what will happen or what options will the government choose, but said if some action was taken against Pakistan, one of his primary concerns was to ensure that Indians at the High Commission in Islamabad remained safe. He asked me to prepare for a situation wherein everyone working at the Indian High Commission could be locked down in a safe place. We did actually prepare for that, and when the surgical strikes took place, we spent four days locked down in a safe place within the Indian High Commission.
AMITABH SINHA: So the former foreign secretary mentioned that something was building up against Pakistan even before the Uri attack? Then, were the surgical strikes a strategic decision rather than a response to an attack on the Indian State? 
No, I am not saying that. My limited point is that the foreign secretary had enough foresight to visualise that we may get into a situation where the safety of the people in the High Commission in Islamabad could be at stake. He said that once he did not have to worry about the safety of Indians in Islamabad, he would be free to consider all options. So it is not that we had already decided to carry out surgical strikes before Uri. No, not at all.
AMITABH SINHA: There has been a debate on whether the recent aerial strikes were effective. For argument’s sake, if we concede that there were zero casualties, and that the strikes probably did not hit the intended targets, would you even then say that the strikes were significant for India, strategically and diplomatically? 
Firstly, in such situations we are not looking at benefit or loss, or victory or defeat. We are not thinking in those terms at all. The fact on the ground is that there is a lot of terrorism emanating from Pakistan. And we want to do something to raise the costs, to dissuade the other country from exercising this kind of option. I also want to say that the military strikes did indeed happen. We can quibble over whether 25 terrorists were killed or 200. That is something that we do not know about. But I believe that the strikes took place and were successful. That is also the most important part. That is the message. The message was not that 200 people were killed. The message was that we can undertake such an exercise to attack terrorist bases and infrastructure. And I think that message has been sent not just to the world but even to Pakistan.
ANURADHA MASCARENHAS: India wants to isolate Pakistan, but there is a SAARC summit that is due, and it has to be held in Islamabad. Do you think it will happen? 
The SAARC summit has been due for some time. Pakistan is the next host. But we are not sure when it will happen. There are at least a few of us in the region — India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan — four out of eight members, who believe that this is not the right time to hold the SAARC summit.
PARTHA SARATHI BISWAS: China has been restrained in its response to the aerial strikes by India. What do you make of it? 
The situation is not easy for China. From their perspective, terrorism is an issue that they realise is a problem across the world, including in China. The Chinese position on terrorism is very clear — they oppose it in all its forms and manifestations. On the other hand, they have this very close, tight strategic, economic, military relationship with Pakistan. Whatever they said at the time could also be due to the fact that our Foreign Minister was scheduled to go to China (for the Russia-India-China meeting). They were a little worried that she may cancel if they push too much. But the kind of reaction that came from the Chinese, even from the RIC meeting, I would say, is a step forward. It is much better for India than it has been in the past.

On the specific issue of listing of Masood Azhar as a terrorist, I think we need to be transactional with China. If there is something that we can do for China — say at the UN, there is an important election where they want us to vote for them — we should ask for a quid pro quo. I say this because last year when the grey listing of Pakistan took place at the Financial Action Task Force meeting, we were able to do this kind of transactional bargain with the Chinese. I think we can do it again. The timing is right. There is enough momentum internationally to get him listed.
MANOJ MORE: What do you make of the hatred that is portrayed between India and Pakistan? What is it like on the ground? Should we be playing cricket with them? 
I don’t think there is a deep-seated hatred for Indians among Pakistanis. The problem is that this terrorism, which is aided, abetted, supported, financed, by Pakistan, is bleeding us. That is the main thing that people in India would want to be stopped. You can discuss all kinds of things — music, literature — with Pakistanis very easily, but the moment it comes to bilateral issues there is a difference of opinion. It is because there is too much emotion involved, and it goes back to the times of Partition.
On cricket, my own gut feeling is that just because the emotions are high, doesn’t mean that we stop playing cricket with Pakistan in an international setting. There is the World Cup (later this year). If we don’t play, we will lose points. I think it is quite silly to lose points when we know we can beat them.
MANOJ MORE: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said he had tried to speak to PM Modi. Do you think the Indian PM should talk to his counterpart in Pakistan? 
Imran Khan is not the first PM to say he wants talks. There were many before him. For us, we have seen this happening before. The point is that if you want to have some sort of talks between India and Pakistan, I don’t believe that the right way to do it is to start at the prime ministerial level. This is one of the reasons why we did not achieve success at the Agra talks in 2001. I would say that whenever we decide to talk to Pakistan, it should start at the lower levels. So you have to have preparatory talks at whatever level it is decided and then build up to a prime ministerial meeting.
Secondly, after the Pulwama attack, Imran Khan said ‘give us proof and we will investigate’. Once again, this is an old record that has been played many times earlier. I want to go back to 2016. The moment the Pathankot attack took place, Nawaz Sharif said the same thing. At the time, we decided to believe them. We allowed their team, which included people from the military and the intelligence, to come to India, and the government faced a lot of flak for it. We gave them all the possible proof. It didn’t go anywhere after that.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: Was the decision to allow a team of Pakistani investigators to access one of the most forward airbases a prudent move? 
Sometimes you decide to place trust in these things. I think it was the first time in decades, if not ever, when we actually allowed a Pakistan investigation team to come. The idea was to share all the information that we have. Taking them to Pathankot was a decision at the highest levels of the government. We did not take them to sensitive parts of the base. We only allowed them access to areas that are relatively less sensitive.
ANJALI MARAR: How do you see India’s presence, and Pakistan’s absence, at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) this year? 
The OIC has recognised the anomaly that one of the countries with the biggest Muslim population was not part of the OIC, and this is a recognition of the facts on the ground. At the same time, we should not think that suddenly the OIC has changed its position completely. This is a process. And it is a process that will unfold in the next 15-20 years. Our participation in the OIC is a turning point, an important inflection point in our relations with West Asia and Islamic countries.
AJAY KHAPE: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was released very soon, in about 48 hours… 
According to the Geneva Convention, they would have had to release him at some point in time. I think the way it must have happened is that Prime Minister Imran Khan might have said that if we have to release him after a few days, why not give him up today and claim credit for it. I hope that is what has happened because it then means that he has been able to convince the military authorities in Pakistan to do this. That is relatively a good thing. I think it was a goodwill gesture, even if it came under international pressure.
AMITABH SINHA: Pakistan started the ‘nuclear’ talk on the first day after the strikes. They had a nuclear command meeting as well but probably decided not to go any further. So, their nuclear threshold is probably not as low as many in India thought? 
They would have a threshold. I don’t know what it is. Maybe people in government have a better idea. I don’t think it is as easy to cross the nuclear threshold.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: How have we handled the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, whom Pakistan has accused of being an Indian spy? 
I want to make only two points. Firstly, it is incumbent on any government that has signed or is party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to give consular access, and till today, Pakistan has not given it to us. Our whole case at the International Court of Justice is this — that you have an international law that provides for consular access and these guys have not given it. The second point is that when a military court undertakes a hearing, we don’t know what happens. We don’t know whether there was anyone to defend him. So that sort of proceeding is bad in law, and hopefully will be turned down by any international court.
SUSHANT KULKARNI: There is also a perception battle being fought after the aerial strikes. 
If you look at the entire episode, you will see the big takeaway is that the entire international community stood by India’s right to self-defence. I think that is the big picture and that is where we have won in this messaging war.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: There have been three incidents of stand-off with China in recent years. How has the approach of India changed? 
You have to factor in the fact that India and China not only do not have a common boundary but we don’t even have a common line of control. When you add to that the fact that both sides have better technology, better roads, better communication… What is beginning to happen is that the militaries of India and China, which used to be fairly far apart, are now coming closer to each other. Both India and China are also conscious not to push the envelope.
SHUBHAJIT ROY: The informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping in Wuhan last year was dubbed as agenda-less… 
We decided that after the confrontation at Doklam, it was important to keep talking to each other. Both countries were able to talk to each other through diplomatic channels. And we agreed to have an informal summit between the leaders. The two leaders spent about eight to 10 hours together. In a formal setting, meetings usually don’t last for more than an hour or so. They were able to cover a lot of topics… It helped clear the air, clear the misunderstandings. It was not an agenda-less meeting. Certain topics were agreed for talks. They covered that and much more.
Informal summits are probably a new diplomatic template that has been introduced. Later this year, when the elections are over, I think the Chinese President will visit India for an informal summit."

Family of soldier SK Vidyarthi, who was killed in the Uri attack of September 18, hailed the surgical strikes conducted by Indian Army along the LoC in Pakistan on Thursday.
“Really happy that Indian Army took initiative and conducted these strikes,” Vidyarthi’s daughter Aarti told reporters. “This (surgical strike) is very good, but we would have been happier had it been done before,” said Vidyarthi’s wife. The Uri martyr’s family lives in Gaya district of Bihar.

The Indian Army on Thursday organised surgical strikes targeting seven terror launch pads across the LoC overnight in which heliborne and ground forces were used. Addressing a press conference, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said India inflicted “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them.
This comes just days after one of the worst terrorist attacks on the Indian Army where 19 army jawans were killed in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri when a four-man fidayeen squad attacked the rear office of an Indian Army infantry installation. The attackers are believed to have come from Pakistan. Following the attack, India has resorted to several diplomatic measures and vowed to internationally isolate Pakistan."

Diplomatic offensive against Pakistan cannot be “fully effective” until the Centre takes steps to end “suppression of democratic rights” of Kashmiri people, CPI(M) said today and urged the government to hold immediate talks with all stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir to solve the dispute.
Noting that the Uri incident has occurred against the backdrop of mass uprising in Kashmir, the Left party suggested the government that the terror attack, which claimed lives of 18 Indian soldiers, cannot become “another pretext” for heightening “repression” in the Valley.
Watch what else is making news

In the editorial of forthcoming issue of party mouthpiece ‘People’s Democracy’, former CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat asked the Centre to launch full-fledged diplomatic efforts and sustained political initiatives to highlight Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorist outfits on global stage.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Any diplomatic offensive against Pakistan cannot be fully effective unless the Modi government takes immediate steps to end the use of lethal weapons like pellet guns and suppression of the democratic rights of the people in Kashmir.
“It should initiate a political process of talks with all shades of political opinion in the state without further delay,” Karat said.
He also sought probe into how militants could cross the line of control (LoC) in Uri and penetrate a “heavily guarded” camp as he pitched for taking comprehensive measures to tackle threat posed by the infiltration of jihadi suicide squads.
“Maintaining strategic restraint, the focus should be on strengthening the security arrangements on the LoC and the international border with Pakistan to ensure that infiltration does not succeed,” he said in this context.
The Marxist leader asked government to launch full-fledged attempt internationally to pressure Pakistan against “harbouring” terrorists.
Karat, however, suggested India’s alleged growing proximity with the US has not benefited New Delhi as he noted that Washington condemned the Uri attack, but did not mention anything about Pakistan.
On the other hand, he added, Russia not only condemned the attack, but also acknowledged Indian claim that the terrorists came from across LoC from Pakistan.
“Russia which has been a trusted friend of India is embarking on its first joint military exercise with Pakistan later this month. This step has to be seen in the background of the burgeoning US-India alliance,” he said, questioning India’s alignment “with US strategic interests”."

(Source: File Photo)
The US has told Pakistan to go after those terrorists who seek and “sometimes find safe haven” in the country and delegitimise all terror groups operating on its soil. “We continue to urge Pakistan to take action to combat and delegitimise all terrorist groups operating on its soil,” State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at his daily news conference.
“Obviously Pakistan has suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists and violent extremists. We want to help Pakistan confront this terrorist threat, but we also want Pakistan also to go after those terrorists who seek and sometimes find safe haven on Pakistan territory,” he said in response to a question yesterday.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following the Uri terror attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed and India’s surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29.
Earlier this week, in a clear indication of its support for India’s surgical strikes in PoK, the US said it empathises with the Indian position that it needs to respond militarily to terror threats and dubbed the Uri attack as a “clear case of cross-border terrorism.” The US had also called for greater cooperation and dialogue between India and Pakistan to bring down the recent tensions and said that they should adopt a “conciliatory approach” to resolve their “contentious issues.”"

Sonakshi Sinha’s upcoming film Noor’s trailer is out and we just cannot stop ourselves from saying, “We relate to that. Yes, that too. And ya, this as well.” Well, if you are a journalist — or any other profession with crazy deadlines, demanding bosses, a group of friends whose answer to everything is booze and a love life that refuses to take off — you will too. Sonakshi plays Noor, who thinks she is fat and is not at all happy about her life. The film is an adaptation of successful novel Karachi, You’re Killing Me! by Saba Imtiaz. While the novel — as the name says it — was set in Karachi, the setting of Noor has been changed to Mumbai.
While the makers and Sonakshi says it has been done to keep it real and relatable, we think it might have to do with the aftermath of Uri attacks and India frowning on anything with the P-word in it.

Talking about her role, Sonakshi said, “Noor fights for the stories she wants to report – asli stories. She loves Mumbai that is why she wants to change it for the better. I have tremendous respect for all the journalists.” Sunhil Sippy, director of the film, said that Sonakshi was the right choice for the film. “Sonakshi was perfect for this role. Noor just happened at the right time,” he said at the trailer launch.

While there are many reasons to keep us excited about this film, we are also keen to know about the song that Sonakshi has been prepping up for. As reported, the actor has collaborated with Diljit Dosanjh and Badshah for a special number for Noor. Directed by debutant Sunhil Sippy, Noor revolves around Sonakshi’s misadventures and love life as she navigates her way through Mumbai. The movie also stars Purab Kohli, Shibani Dandekar, and Kanan Gill.

BJP’s West Bengal unit today questioned the “stoic silence” of Trinamool Congress on India’s surgical strike on terror launch pads in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) in retaliation to Uri attack. “Why are they silent… they should come out clean on this matter. The entire nation wants to know why didn’t they congratulate the Army on its successful operation,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.
“The nation wants to know whether they are on the side of India or Pakistan. Whether they love the country or they are against it,” he said after the party’s two-day state committee meeting and also informed that the state unit of the party has decided to launch a campaign on this issue.

“Each and every political party had congratulated the Prime Minister and the Indian Army on the surgical strike which was conducted to avenge the death of our soldiers.
“Even non-BJP parties cutting across political lines have congratulated the Army and the PM. The only exception is TMC. They maintained a stoic silence on this issue,” Ghosh said.
Earlier, BJP had questioned the Trinamool government’s decision of giving “just Rs 2 lakh” to the soldiers from West Bengal killed in Uri attack, while the other states had announced to give Rs 10 lakh.
In the two-day state committee, it was also decided that the party will launch a massive campaign against the “communal polarisation that has grown by leaps and bounds under the TMC rule”.
BJP also criticised Trinamool for “forcibly” taking over all opposition-controlled municipalities and civic bodies.
“Is it a sign of a healthy democracy that Trinamool is taking over all opposition-controlled municipalities and forcing MLAs either by the use of muscle power or money power to join TMC? This murder of democracy should stop,” Ghosh said."

BRICS nations on Sunday decided to establish an independent rating agency based on market-oriented principles saying it would further strengthen global governance architecture. Officials said that they were very optimistic about the prospects of a new rating agency.
The Goa declaration on Sunday said: “We welcome experts exploring the possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles, in order to further strengthen the global governance architecture.”

“We believe that BRICS institution-building is critical to our shared vision of transforming the global financial architecture to one based on the principles of fairness and equity,” the declaration said.
“In order to further bridge the gap in the global financial architecture, we agreed to fast track the setting up of a BRICS Rating Agency,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement at the conclusion of the BRICS Summit.
The BRICS countries have already set up New Development Bank, which became operational last year, to meet funding requirements of the members.
Advocating for a new credit rating agency backed by BRICS group, New Development Bank president KV Kamath had expressed concerns over methodologies of the big three global agencies saying that these are constraining growth in emerging nations.
Kamath had said despite having deep capital buffers, the ratings of multilateral banks like the BRICS-promoted NDB are affected due to the parent countries’ sovereign ratings.
Giving the example of NDB itself, which is planning to get itself rated for bond-raising in many countries, he had said its rating will be affected because the promoter countries are not AAA-rated.
“We need not constrain ourselves from our ability to do business … if this is the norm, I fear growth in the developing world will also be impacted,” Kamath had said.
Kamath’s comments followed concerns expressed by the BRICS group against the working of the rating market, currently controlled by the Big Three — S&P, Fitch and Moody’s — all based in the US."

When the US and the UK asked Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to condemn the attack on the Indian Army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, he flatly refused to denounce the assault.
According to the News International, both the world powers asked Sharif to condemn the attack, which left 19 Indian soldiers dead, during the premier’s meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Prime Minister Theresa May at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

According to sources, Sharif instead countered the two leaders over their silence regarding the unrest in the Kashmir Valley since July 9, which has claimed the lives of nearly 90 persons.
The sources said Sharif maintained that Islamabad could not condemn the attack, which India has blamed on Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, and the death of the security personnel when “India had no regret over its atrocities and brutalities” in the valley.
Sharif said that the world, including London and Washington, had turned a blind eye to the killing of Kashmiris in clashes with the security forces after the killing of Hizbul militant Burhan Wani in July.

Pakistan categorically rejected the Indian allegations of Islamabad’s involvement in the Uri attack.
However, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan offered full cooperation to probe the incident as it believed the attack was either an “Indian false flag operation” carried out to malign Pakistan and divert the world attention from Kashmir issue or it was a “retaliatory attack by the oppressed Kashmiris who are facing the worst form of brutalities from the Indian state terrorism”.
“With such a clear stance on Kashmir, expecting from the Pakistani premier to condemn the Uri attack and killing of Indian soldiers is really unfair and irrational,” another source said."

(Source: Sumit Purohit/Youtube)
Not many would have predicted the kind of impact the Uri attack would have on the Indian film industry. Reports are rife on the producer-director Karan Johar being forced to tweak the storyline of his next release Ae Dil Hai Mushkil after the ban on Pakistani actors and singers working in India.

In fact, there have been reports on how Johar is majorly rewriting the Fawad Khan-starrer, and even changing the nationalities of the two principle female characters in the film. The characters played by Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are Pakistani, according to the existing storyline. An unconfirmed DNA report said Johar is apparently working on changing the story so that the two would now hail from a different country altogether. Not only that, the same article also suggested that the film-maker was toying with the idea of replacing Fawad Khan’s face with that of Saif Ali Khan!https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As bizarre as that sounds, the replacement idea was enough to get the creative juices flowing for some, and lo and behold, we have ourselves a Fawad Khan-less Ae Dil Hai Mushkil trailer. Sumit Purohit, editor and writer, has taken the initiative and gone ahead to digitally remove Khan from the trailer, only to replace him with none other than FTII’s controversial chairman Gajendra Chauhan. Purohit uploaded a “new” trailer, saying, “Fawad Khan has been digitally replaced from Ae Dil by the heartthrob of the nation, Gajendra Chauhan. Please watch the film now. Peace be upon us.”

The Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India’s (COEAI) decision asking exhibitors not to release any movie featuring Pakistani artistes in single screen theatres has now landed Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil(ADHM) in hot waters. The film stars Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in a pivotal role, leading to the decision. Earlier Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) had also banned Pakistani actors. However, IMPPA had requested MNS to let the completed films such as Ae Dil hai Mushkil and Raees release.
WATCH VIDEO: Anurag Kashyap Targets PM Narendra Modi Regarding ADHM Ban And Gets Slammed
 
In an exclusive conversation with indianexpress.com, Nitin Datar, President of COEAI tells us the reason behind this diktat.
What is the decision taken? Is there a ban?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
There is no ban. We have only suspended the release of films where Pakistani artists or technicians are connected. Our decision is that we will not screen or release the movies in our cinemas.
Does the association have the power to suspend the release of the film?
It is our prerogative whether to release any film or not. It is the prerogative of the distributor whether to give the film to certain exhibitors or not.
Are they duty bound to obey your association’s decision?
It is our request to them.

 
So you have requested them to suspend the release of films featuring Pakistani actors?
Yes. This is a request to all our members to not screen the film keeping in mind the sentiments of the Indian public. It’s been happening for the last one month in the wake of the Uri attacks and cross-border firing. The sentiments of public are against Pakistani films. Pakistan has already banned our Hindi content on satellite. We haven’t done that. We have taken the decision to suspend films featuring Pakistani actors, given patriotic sentiments of our public. The public will be happy that the association took such a decision.
Have the exhibitors agreed to this decision of your association?
Exhibitors have agreed, that’s why we took the decision.
But isn’t it the government’s call to ban or suspend a film?

It’s my committee’s choice whether to suspend any picture or not. The government is not going to tell you u whether to ban a picture of not. It is my committee’s choice.
But that makes me ask the question again, does your association have the power to suspend a film?
No.
Also read | Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in trouble, cinema owners’ body refuse to screen it in four states
So this is a request?
Yes.
But the person who will be suffering the losses owing to the decision will be Karan Johar who is an Indian?
Are we are not suffering losses? Aren’t the exhibitors suffering losses? What will happen if theatres are damaged? Is Karan Johar going to compensate? Who will compensate the damages done?
Are you saying if ADHM is released, the political party who called for the ban will inflict damages?
There may be anyone who can inflict damages. Why just political parties?
But the government is there to offer protection and maintain law and order and theatre owners can seek protection if they feel there is an imminent threat to life and property?
It is Diwali period and government cannot give protection to all cinema screens. People can enter the cinema and inflict damages.
What is your advice to Karan Johar?
My advice is to wait for some time for things to settle down. But it is for him to decide what needs to be done.
So for the moment your association has decided not to screen ADHM and other films featuring Pakistani films?
At present, this is the decision.
And has every single-screen owner agreed to the same?
Theatre owners have to agree or not that is their call. But we have given our instruction and I am sure everyone will agree."

Taking a jibe at the Congress president, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said that like the disclaimers before TV serials, television channels will soon run disclaimers ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s speeches calling them “fiction”.
“In his speeches he only abuses the Prime Minister. Like the TV serials begin with the disclaimer that all the characters are fictional and have no resemblance to anyone living or dead, these channels will run disclaimers ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s speeches,” Fadnavis, who was campaigning in Gujarat, said, targeting the Congress’ manifesto and its promise of eradicating poverty.
“His (Rahul) great grandfather, grandmother, father and even mother had made similar promises in the past. But nothing happened. Again they are back with the same promises, but I want to ask how? They have promised Rs 72,000 (per year) to poor families, but do not have an answer to how they will manage the money.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also attacked the Congress manifesto’s aim to remove special powers given to the Indian Army. “Their manifesto says that they will remove the Army from Kashmir and end the special powers given to them (AFSPA). Tomorrow if someone attacks our armed forces and they can’t retaliate, then what will be our answer.”
Attacking the former Congress regime, he said that they lacked guts to retaliate against terror attacks in the country. “Modi government told the world that this is a new India. After 2014, we began our fight against terrorism. First after Uri (attack). But, Pakistan thought that it was the old India and it attacked again. But, we retaliated again. Today we have joined the leagues of America and Israel where we give befitting replies to terror activities.”
“But, there were two entities that raised questions and asked for proof of the Balakot strike. One was Pakistan, which was ashamed of itself after the strike, and another was Congress. If we had known that they would need proof, we would have tied a Congress leader to the rocket (aircraft) we sent to Balakot,” he said.
Fadnavis appealed to the people to vote for Ranjan Bhatt, the BJP candidate for Vadodara constituency, and thus vote for Modi. “It is Delhi’s election, not a gully election. We have to decide in whose responsible hands we want to hand over our nation,” he said."

Vice President Hamid Ansari will raise with Hungary and Algeria the issue of cross border terrorism affecting India amid the going tension with Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack and surgical strikes carried out by Indian Army in terror launch pads. Ansari will embark on a four-day visit to Hungary and Algeria on Saturday. “Absolutely. This will be the major theme in all his (Vice-President) bilateral talks,” Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs Sujata Mehta told reporters here when asked whether Ansari will raise the issue of cross border terrorism with the leaders of the two countries.
Mehta said “terrorism will be a major item in both Hungary and Algeria”. She said terrorism is not new for Algeria and it has fought a very difficult terror group in the recent past. “There will be meetings of minds to fight terrorism with all his interlocutors and counterparts in both the countries,” she said.
During the visit, Mehta said, Ansari will have bilateral meetings with Presidents of Hungary and Algeria, Prime Minister of Hungary and Speakers of national assembly. She said the high-level visit to Hungary comes after more than two decades when the then President Shankar Dayal Sharma had visited the central European country in 1993.
Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in 2001. While around 50 Indian companies are operating in Hungary and have made their base to expand their businesses in other European countries, bilateral trade between India and Algeria stood at 1.5 billion per annum, majority of which are related to importing oil and oil products to India."

An educational institute in Ajmer has called off a student-exchange programme involving a delegation from Pakistan in view of the escalating tension between the two countries and opposition of some Hindu outfits.

“The Hindu outfits had apprised us of their concern and said they would protest against the visit of the delegation.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday morning reviewed the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir, especially along the LoC, during a meeting attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, top officials of the home ministry, defence ministry, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies.
Jaishankar’s presence at the meeting assumes significance as the government is set to launch a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan after the Uri attack.

A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) is likely to be held on Wednesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi visited Srinagar and chaired a security review meeting with top security and intelligence officials.
Mehrishi also met Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and Governor N N Vohra. “The home secretary had detailed deliberations with the CM over the law and order situation…,” a spokesman said. “The governor and home secretary held extensive discussions about the security situation consequent to the Uri attack and the restoration of normalcy in the state.”
Speaking on the sidelines of a function in New Delhi, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju told reporters that any response to the Uri attack would be taken by the government after due consideration. “Action will be taken after due consideration. Action is not taken after making announcements,” he said.
“It is a very serious issue… The matter cannot be handled just like that,” Rijiju added.
Home ministry sources said that Pakistan had decided not to send its intelligence bureau chief to attend the two-day conference of the High-Level Group of Eminent Experts from South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries, to be held in New Delhi from Thursday.

In the last two years, the Indian army has repeatedly foiled attempts by Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups to infiltrate into India. Ninety-seven terrorists were gunned down in 2015, of whom 59 were Pakistanis. The number has crossed 110 in the last eight months. Again 84 of them were of Pakistani origin. At least 17 attempts by the infiltrators were foiled by the army in the last eight months.
As is said, the terrorist has to be lucky just once, whereas the security forces have to be lucky every time. Despite best efforts by our security forces, the country couldn’t escape a couple of incidents of terror, at Pathankot and Uri. The important point to bear in mind is that at a time when terror has struck many European and American cities, India has largely remained terror-free in the last couple of years. It is a well known fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made sincere and genuine efforts to convince the neighbour of the futility of supporting, sponsoring and launching terror. He has met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif a couple of times in the last two years. He made an impromptu visit to Lahore on his way back from Kabul. The two prime ministers met in Russia and decided to have a three-tier dialogue process set in motion between the two countries.
But then came the infamous Pathankot attack, where the Pakistani terrorists had succeeded in penetrating into the Indian Air Force base and held on for close to 72 hours, until they were neutralised. Pathankot was the first major terror challenge thrown at PM Modi by Pakistan. The Indian government had tried one last time to deal with it in the conventional manner. It went so far as to even allow Pakistani investigators access to parts of the attack site.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Despite the Indian government’s overtures, Pakistan remained a nation committed to terror, lies and denial. Sadly, it allowed an olive branch extended by PM Modi to lapse. It didn’t realise that it was dealing with a different leader and a different government. Pathankot and the aftermath was the proverbial last nail. Any further misadventure from Pakistan was to receive a tough response from India. Uri was more than a misadventure by Pakistan. Killing 18 soldiers inside a military camp situated a couple of kilometres inside the LoC is nothing short of a war crime. If terrorism becomes the state policy of a rogue nation, victim countries are left with very few options. Uri too has left India with very limited options.
More than the military might, it was the political will that was challenged. When I used the phrase, “For one tooth the entire jaw”, at one level, I was giving vent to the strong popular anger and resentment, but at another level it meant that the government should now go all out to end this menace. The prime minister had on Day One made it clear that this time the perpetrators shall “not go unpunished”. In a way, barring the usual gang of peaceniks and mombattiwalas, largely the country and the government were on the same page with regard to responding to this misadventure by Pakistan.
Normally, it couldn’t have come at a more difficult time — the United Nations was in session. But the Indian government saw an opportunity in this difficulty. A multi-pronged action plan was quickly put in place wherein a diplomatic offensive was launched together with a publicity overdrive.
India’s aggressive response to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s lies at the UN was a clear indicator of the things to come. It didn’t mince words, called Pakistan the host of “the Ivy League of terror”, described it as the “global epicentre of terrorism” and finally the young IFS lady officer, exercising the right of reply, thundered, “What we see in Pakistan, Mr President, is a terrorist state.’.
Naming and shaming Pakistan globally, isolating it on the diplomatic front and acting against terror targets were all a part of the multi-pronged strategy devised by the government. Leaving behind the policy paralysis of yesteryears and the so-called “strategic restraint”, the prime minister has taken the battle right deep inside the Pakistan territory by talking to the people of that country directly.
In his Kozhikode address, the prime minister had spoken about the need for both the countries to fight against hunger, illiteracy and backwardness; but he had not precluded action against Pakistan. In fact he told the Indian army that 1.25 billion Indians were behind it and repeated his earlier statement that he wouldn’t let the perpetrators of the Uri attack escape punishment. Some peaceniks wanted to read a different message in it. Some of those who were sworn adversaries of PM Modi, started penning blogs too, praising Modi’s “restraint”. But before their ink could dry, the operations against the terrorists waiting at the launch pads across the LoC in PoK were successfully completed by the Indian Army in a midnight operation.
Uri has changed India-Pakistan relations significantly. They will no longer be the same for at least some time to come. War nobody wants; but the alternative to war is peace; not humiliation and terror attacks. The rants of some Pakistan ministers about the nuclear first-use show the rogue nature of that country, which is the worst proliferator in recent years. Nuclear war nobody wants but the world can’t be a mute witness to the nuclear blackmail of rogue nations.
Terrorism is a global cancer. It needs surgical intervention. India has done its part. It will continue to defend its borders and citizens from this menace in the same manner. But it is also time the world community exerts pressure on Pakistan; pressure not just to ask Pakistan to “behave”, but as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj exhorted at the UN, if it doesn’t behave, throw it out of all international fora. That has already happened at the SAARC.

For Pakistan, terrorism has come as a cheaper option all these years. Time to make it costly for it."

Raees and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil had landed themselves in trouble after the Raj Thackeray-led MNS called for a ban of all films featuring Pakistani actors post the Uri attack. Karan Johar faced maximum heat as the filmmaker ran from pillar to post while trying to ensure the quick release of his film. After multiple negotiations, MNS finally relented after a close door meeting between the warring parties with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis playing the peacemaker.

Raj Thackeray called for a truce after declaring that every filmmaker who has worked with Pakistani actors should pay a sum of Rs 5 crore to Army welfare fund by way of penance. Farhan Akhtar, one of the co-producers of Raees, had strongly criticised Raj Thackeray’s offer in the past.

Ramon Magsaysay award winner T M Krishna on Saturday said cultural authoritarianism was far more powerful than economic power and what was happening in Bollywood now was another example of that power. He was replying to a query on the development in Bollywood in the wake of a threat by MNS to Hindi film “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”, during an interaction at the Kovalam Literary Festival in Thiruvananthapuram.

“I think what is happening today in so called Bollywood is another example of that power. You will have all the money in the world. But if certain cultural oppression is practised, that has greater pressure and impact than all the money you have,” Krishna said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Karan Johar’s “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”, slated for Diwali release on October 28, had been embroiled in controversy over the past few weeks after MNS opposed the screening of movies featuring Pakistani actors after the Uri terror attack.
Earlier in the day, the decks were cleared for its release after Karan Johar and Producers’ Guild President Mukesh Bhatt met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and assured him that filmmakers would not work with Pakistani artistes, given the people’s sentiments in India post the Uri attack.
Asked about the controversy surrounding triple talaq and Uniform Civil Code, Krishna sought to know whether they had been mooted with the right intention. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board had taken a stand to oppose the Centre’s affidavit, which said the practise of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims needed a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.
AIMPLB and other Muslim bodies had said they would boycott the Law Commission’s proceedings in the matter and had accused the Modi government of waging a “war” against their personal laws. They also said a Uniform Civil Code would “kill” India’s pluralism.
Krishna said the the biggest tragedy of the country was that “we have surrendered, gifted politics to politicians”. Another important thing was loss of the Left, resulting in weakening of progressive movement in the country, he noted.
“When I say Left…not as a political party. But the idea of Left. I think that is one of the biggest reasons why the progressive movement that allowed diverse conversion, disagreement and everything has died down,” he said.
“I think if Left wakes up….then we will have an interesting discourse. Artists will say different things and if that does not happen, we will have a problem.”"

The escalating tension between India and Pakistan and MNS call for ban on Pakistani artistes has been making news every day. After MNS said they will block the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starring Fawad Khan and Raees starring Mahira Khan, there were speculations regarding how the filmmakers will cope.
On Sunday evening, a DNA report claimed that Maheera Khan has been dropped from Shah Rukh Khan’s film. Quoting an unnamed source, the report said, “It was a very painful decision for producer Ritesh Sidhwani to take. The pressure to replace her had been building up for months. It reached a crescendo after the Uri attacks. It came to a point where it became impossible to shoot with any Pakistani artiste. People suggested all kinds of solutions to the impasse, including shooting in Dubai. But it didn’t seem viable. Now, Mahira has unfortunately been relieved of her duties.”
While no official confirmation came from the producers or SRK, the film’s director Rahul Dholakia tweeted late in the night, “Cooker ki saat seeti Baj chuki hai, aag dena bandh kar” (not a line from Raees, I has better dialogues). He didn’t name anyone in the tweet.

This is not the first speculation about a Pakistani artiste being dropped from a film. After MS Dhoni: The Untold Story came out, a website reported that the makers had dropped Fawad Khan who played the role of Virat Kohli in the film. However, film’s producer Fox Star denied the news and said Fawad was never a part of the film.
Shaha Rukh Khan’s Raees is supposed to release on January 26 when it will clash with Hrithik Roshan-starrer Kaabil."

Seven soldiers and several terrorists were killed in two separate attacks in Jammu on Tuesday. The first attack took place in Nagrota on the outskirts of Jammu city where terrorists, carrying guns and grenades stormed into an Army camp. Although all two terrorists were eliminated by the security forces, seven Army men were killed in the gun battle. The second incident took place in Samba sector near the Pakistan border where the forces gunned down three militants.

Police sources that an unknown number of militants barged into the military camp at Nagrota town, near the headquarters of the Indian Army’s 16 Corps — a military formation that acts as a nerve centre to fight militancy and defend the borders in Jammu region.
A police officer said the militants carrying automatic weapons and explosives entered the field regiment camp around 5.30 a.m. They started firing indiscriminately at the Officers’ Mess inside. The dead soldiers included Major Kunal Gossain of 166 Medium Regiment Artillery, the officer said. The body of one of the slain gunmen was recovered even as the fighting was still raging. However, military spokesperson Lt. Col Manish Mehta refused to divulge details of the attack or the casualties. “We will not confirm any casualty till the operation is over,” Mehta said, adding that heavy exchange of fire was still on.
The Jammu-Srinagar highway, which runs through Nagrota, has been closed for traffic near the town after the security forces cordoned off the area. As soldiers battled the militants in Nagrota, another gunfight raged in Samba, some 40 km south of here.
A police officer said security forces engaged a group of infiltrators from Pakistan in a shootout near the International Border. Three militants were killed in the heavy exchange of fire during which an ammunition dump caught flames and exploded, critically injuring at least six border policemen, including an officer of the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) rank, B.S. Kasana.
The six, including Special Operation Group Inspector Sarabjit Singh, were taken to a hospital here, a police officer said, adding their condition was serious.
The violence on Tuesday followed days of calm on the border and the Line of Control (LoC) between Indian and Pakistani forces. The two sides have been exchanging heavy mortar and artillery fire for months after the September 18 killing of 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on a military base in the border town of Uri in Kashmir.
Following the Uri attack, the Indian Army destroyed at least seven terror launch pads and killed an unknown number of terrorists and their sympathisers across the LoC in Pakistani Kashmir. Since then, militants have attacked security forces in at least a dozen strikes in Jammu and Kashmir."

(File)
As the anger builds up in India against Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack, fears have started mounting over the fate of the Kartarpur Corridor, a long pending demand of the Sikh community that is finally seeing the light of the day with work in progress on both sides of the border. Several quarters feel that the attack, which left 40 CRPF personnel dead, may cast a shadow on Corridor.

As India withdrew the status of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) conferred on Pakistan, all eyes are on the Corridor now. With Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh urging the Centre to give a “befitting reply” to Pakistan, the state was abuzz with a discussion that if such an action was taken, it would mean curtains on the Corridor.
Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who was in Amritsar, said the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre was committed towards letting devotees to pay obeisance at the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan but added that there was a need to be realistic on the issue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Read | PM on Pulwama Attack: We have given security forces full freedom to respond
“I don’t want to give any judgment over it. I had said on returning after attending ground breaking ceremony of the Corridor in Pakistan that we should be realistic. Pakistan has been undermining us for many years. They use terror as instrument of policy. This latest terror attack fits into that pattern. It is my personal, and government’s view also, there cannot be business as usual,” he said.
Without taking any name, the union minister said political leaders went to Pakistan and hugged Pakistan army chief without realising that such people engineered terror attacks against India.
“As per my opinion, trade activities cannot take place with the Pakistan in the light of prevailing circumstances particularly after terror attack in Pulwama,” he added.

He said, “Surgical strike was a step after the Uri attack and this time too government will take required action…We should be realistic over this strategy of Pakisan. On the one hand it has responded to the Corridor but on the other hand it is supporting terror groups from its soil against India. How long will this go ? Even Amarinder Singh had warned Pakistan army during ground breaking ceremony of the Corridor on Indian side against carrying out inhuman attacks in India.”
Amarinder, meanwhile, expressed hope that the heightened bitterness between the two nations would not impact the Corridor. “I hope the attack will not impact Kartarpur Corridor. I have already pressed for visa-free ‘khule darshan’.”
He added that he was confident the corridor would be well protected, but said there was need for a change in attitude on the part of Pakistan if peace between the two countries was to be promoted. Amarinder was responding to a question on whether the developments over the last 48 hours mean an end of road for the Corridor.
The Congress camp feels that there could be political ramifications, at least in Punjab, if the project is shelved. “But the Congress will have nothing to lose as the onus will be on BJP. “
A Congress leader said the attack had vindicated Amarinder’s stand on Pakistan. “That is why he spoke with such conviction in the Assembly today. He can see through the designs of Pakistan. But it remains to be seen whether the Sikhs are able to see through or not.”
Punjab’s local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who stirred up a controversy by attending the ground breaking ceremony of Kartarpur corridor on Pakistan side, expressed confidence that the project will become a reality. “Do you mean to say a few miscreants can turn down efforts of peace between two nations? Why should a corridor of peace be overshadowed by an act of miscreants? “ he said.
Incidentally, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee, feels that the terror attack will not have an impact on the Corridor issue. “It is not the first attack. Such attack have taken place in past too. We don’t think it should have any impact on Kartarpur Corridor. These are inhuman acts and enemies of humanity carry out such attacks. Kartarpur Corridor is different issue and it should not be linked with attack,” SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said.
He said, “Both countries have been working on Kartarpur corridor and these talks and activities should continue. Corridor will pave way for peace and harmony between the two countries.”
Shiromani Akali Dal spokesman and former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said, “Our party would definitely like to see the Kartarpur Corridor developed. The attack should not have an impact on the Corridor. We will see what happens in future.”
Dera Baba Nanak municipal committee president Perneet Singh said the project can bring peace to the region. “Dera Baba Nanak has suffered the tag of border town for years. It was after 70 years of partition that we were able to see development coming to Dera Baba Nanak in form of Kartarpur Corridor. But this attack may prove fatal for the project. This project can bring peace to region.”"

Pakistan today demanded an international probe into the Uri terror attack with its Senate passing a resolution calling on the UN to conduct an independent inquiry into the incident. The resolution was moved in the Senate, the Upper House of the Parliament, by Leader of the House Raja Zafarul Haq of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The resolution that was passed unanimously in the Senate said the House expresses its strong solidarity with the Kashmiri people.
Calling on the United Nations to hold an independent inquiry into the Uri incident, the resolution also urged the international community to immediately take notice of the “grave human rights violations” in Kashmir, Radio Pakistan reported. It also called upon the international community to make India “desist from war hysteria to distract attention away from Indian crimes against humanity” in Jammu and Kashmir.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, during a discussion on the motion in the Senate regarding the present state of Indo-Pak relations especially after the recent statements by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said Pakistan will provide support to a probe into the Uri attack provided such a probe was carried out by an international body.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pakistan had not accepted the Indian “narratives” about the attack and during the investigation all the evidences should be produced before the investigators along with details of the incident, Aziz was quoted as saying by Radio Pakistan. “Pakistan denies all the allegations leveled by the Indian Prime Minister,” he said. Earlier, while speaking to BBC, Aziz said, “An independent international commission should be constituted to unearth the facts.” “It is not the first time India has leveled baseless allegations against Pakistan,” he said. Any such attack neither benefits Pakistan, nor Kashmir, Aziz said, adding that the attack diverts the world’s attention from “human rights violations committed” by India in Kashmir.
Aziz, while speaking in the Senate, also claimed that Modi’s efforts to isolate Pakistan had been scuttled as 56 countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), UN Human Rights Council and world countries have supported Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir and did not pay any attention towards India’s blame.
Diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan have been rising since the September 18 attack on an army base in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 18 Indian soldiers."

In an interview to Time magazine in May 2015, the prime minister of India had said: “So, in so far as freedom of speech is concerned, there is absolutely not an iota of doubt in terms of our commitment and our belief in that.’’ He has also repeatedly spoken about democracy in India: “Our strength is democracy,’’ he said in Mann Ki Baat, June this year.
Freedom of speech allows people to express their opinions. And democracy gives us all equal rights to express opinions — in our case, over one billion opinions and possibly more since many of us hold more than one, often contrary, opinion at the same time.
Shyam Benegal, one of our most respected film directors, and Om Puri, one of our most respected actors, were asked by certain TV news channels, for their opinions on demands that Pakistani artistes must condemn the Uri terrorist attack or be banned from India and Indian cultural productions. Each, in his own way, said that Pakistani artistes are individuals who do not necessarily represent their government, and that it is not for them — Benegal or Puri — but the Indian government which granted them visas, to decide their fate.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Puri suggested that they may be “scared” to condemn the Uri attacks for fear of reprisals (CNN News), Benegal wondered how it was possible for them to condemn their own government — held responsible by India for harbouring and aiding the terrorists (Times Now).
TV anchors on Times Now, CNN News and News X went after them for their opinions. They badgered them, attacked them, demanded to know why that they did not condemn the Pakistani artistes for not condemning the Uri attack.
On News X, Puri was mocked by Rahul Shivshankar for being “sensitive”: You are a very “sensitive” person, why don’t you ask them to “sensitively” denounce this attack, asked Shivshankar. Puri’s patriotism was questioned: As an Indian have you no role? If people, such as you, “sir”, won’t take a stand. On and on, it went.
At CNN News, Bhupendra Chaubey said Bollywood was seemingly “polarised” on the issue. When Om Puri suggested that Pakistani artistes were silent on Uri because they could be scared — referring to Sikhs during terrorism in Punjab as an analogy — Chaubey, sarcastically, interjected, “Oh sir.”
He said that all “we”, this “entire country” wants is for them (the Pakistani artistes) is to simply condemn the Uri attack — is it unfair on “our” part to demand that? Logically, all these questions should have been put to the Pakistani artistes but leave that aside.
It has become commonplace for some English TV news anchors to claim that they speak for the nation (the nation wants to know. remember?).

Who conferred this right on them? No one knows: Yes, English news TV does reach approximately 16 million people a week cumulatively (please refer to BARC to understand the complexities of viewership measurement) but that does that mean TV anchors represent the nation and the diversity of its people’s views?
Nevertheless, they have taken it upon themselves to demand, in its name, answers from guests, and the right to badger, berate, judge often highly respected citizens like a Benegal or a Puri who do not agree, entirely, with their opinion.
And since they speak for the nation in this “for and against” binary narrative, if you disagree with the news anchor’s point of view (that’s all it is), you are anti-national.
Another thought: Here are two, among other Indian artistes, who expressed an opinion, took a stand. They have been hauled over coals for it. Perhaps that is why artistes, sometimes, choose to remain silent?
On the day of the Uri attack, channels like News X, telecast photographs of political leaders like CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and questioned their “dove”-like stance on Kashmir, mocking their view that the government should talk to all stakeholders in the Valley to resolve issues there. What happened to freedom of speech in a democracy, ideals championed by the PM himself?"

Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus Padmaavat is finally inching towards its scheduled release date on January 25. The film has been through various storms and controversies but this isn’t the first time that a piece of art, especially a movie, has become a cause of concern for various political and religious groups. Padmaavat has seen everything, from their sets being vandalised to death threats, and even now the film is struggling to get a nation-wide release.
But Bhansali’s Padmaavat is not the first film to struggle for a release. Many other Bollywood films have faced similar protests on the basis of their content, language, title and sometimes even on the lyrics of a song. Here’s a list of films that were embroiled in controversies:
Lipstick Under My Burkha (2017)
Alankrita Shrivastava’s “lady oriented” film was too bold for CBFC which refused to certify it for its bold content. After a long battle with the CBFC, the film saw the light of the day when Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) passed it.
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016)https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Karan Johar’s film faced a lot of heat from political circles as it starred Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in a pivotal role. The film’s release was scheduled for Diwali 2016 but due to the rising tension between India and Pakistan after the Uri attacks, MNS threatened the filmmaker with dire consequences if they released the film without cutting Fawad’s portions. Karan Johar promised the political party that he would not work with any Pakistani actor in the future and donated Rs 5 crore to the Indian Army Welfare Foundation.
Udta Punjab (2016)
The film was based on the drug menace in Punjab but its subject ruffled feathers. Political parties across the country believed that this film was showing Punjab in a bad light and hence, wanted many cuts in the film. The film was cleared by Bombay and Punjab & Haryana High Courts but a Punjab based NGO later took their plea to the apex court to stop the release. The apex court did hear the case but decided to not interfere with the High Court’s ruling.

Bajirao Mastani (2015)
The descendants of Peshwa Bajirao felt that the song ‘Pinga’ was offensive to Marathi culture as it had Mastani and Kashibai dancing together. Not just the song, the costumes of the leading ladies and certain dialogues mouthed by Bajirao’s character were termed as vulgar and offensive.
PK (2014)
Soon after the first poster of the film was released, there were objections on the look that was sported by Aamir Khan. The poster had him carrying a jukebox with a bare body. The makers later released a new poster where he was clothed. After the poster storm got over, various Hindu groups had objections to the film’s content. They felt that Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani mocked Hinduism. Effigies were burnt and various threats were made but the film managed to bear the storm.

Madras Cafe (2013)
Various political parties in Tamil Nadu asked for a ban on the film after the release of its trailer as they felt that the film carried an anti-Tamil sentiment. Producer John Abraham said that he should not be held at gun point to make changes in the film and he would go ahead with whatever decision CBFC takes for the film. The film was ultimately released but some theaters in Tamil Nadu stayed away from screening it.
Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (2013)
A petition was filed against the film’s name, that was originally titled Ram Leela, by Prabhu Samaj Dharmik Ram Leela Committee as they felt it hurt religious sentiments. Bhansali changed the film’s title and the film could then sail through a smooth release.
Student of the Year (2012)
The film ran into controversy because of “The Radha Song”. The adjective sexy was used which raised objections from various religious organisations. The word had to be replaced from “sexy” to “desi” in the final song and the protests were called off.

Singh Saab The Great (2013)
The film was originally titled Singh Sahib the Great but the Akal Takht, the highest body of the Sikhs objected to the film’s title. They felt that the title was disrespectful and hence, it was changed to Singh Saab the Great.
Aarakshan (2011)
The film’s subject dealt with the caste-based reservation system and many pro-Dalit groups in Kanpur objected to Saif Ali Khan’s casting as a Dalit man. The film was eventually banned in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. Later, director Prakash Jha removed various scenes from the film that could have aggravated communal tension.

Rockstar (2011)
Sadda Haq, the song in the film became a point of contention between the CBFC and the film’s director, Imtiaz Ali. Portions of the song were shot in McLeod Ganj and Dharamsala and the crowd scenes had people waving the ‘Free Tibet’ flag. These shots were later blurred out and it was only then that CBFC passed the film.
Billu (2009)
The film’s original title was Billu Barber but the barber community got together and raised objections as they felt that the film was demeaning their profession. The makers had to drop ‘Barber’ from their title and the film was released with a new title.

Kaminey (2009)
The makers of this film faced troubles when Jagannath Sena Sangathan filed an FIR against them at a police station in Puri. The line ‘Apna Haath Jagannath’ being written on a poster showing a scantily clad woman on the wall of a public toilet upset the organisation. The objectionable clip was deleted from the prints that were released in Orissa.
Jodhaa Akbar (2008)
Rajputs in Rajasthan tried to block screenings of this Ashutosh Gowariker film as they felt that history was being misrepresented in the film. The Rajput Sabha and the Rajput Karni Sena felt that the film was factually incorrect and hence, the film should not be screened.

Black Friday (2007)
Anurag Kashyap’s film was originally made in 2004 but since the 1993 Mumbai bomb blast case was still pending in the court, the release was stopped. The petition seeking a stay on the release asked that since the matter was sub judice, the movie would influence the popular opinion and could affect the judiciary’s opinion as well. The film ultimately released in 2007 after the court’s judgement was declared.
Fire (1996)
The film saw a plethora of protests soon after its release which included Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal activists vandalising theaters and burning posters of the film. The film’s story dealt with the same-sex relationship between two women and at the time it was called “alien to Indian culture” by then CM of Maharashtra, Manohar Joshi. The film was passed by the CBFC without any cuts and that irked the protesters even more.

Kissa Kursi Ka (1977)
The political satire was a spoof on Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi but the timing of the film landed it in great trouble. It was during the Emergency era that the film was supposed to get a release but the subject irked the ruling political party so much that they decided to burn all the prints of the film. The film ultimately witnessed a release after a new central government was elected.
Aandhi (1975)
26 weeks after its release in 1975, the film was banned. It was believed that the film was based on Indira Gandhi’s life as the promotional material hinted towards the same. After objections were raised, many scenes of the film were re-shot. A scene where the protagonist can be seen with Gandhi’s portrait in the background was inserted to re-iterate the fact that this was in fact, not based on Indira Gandhi. The film was later re-released in 1977 after a new government came in power.

Looking back at the history, we wonder how many names would be added to this list even after Padmaavat."

Now two, he recently had his second heart surgery in India and may require third.
As the country bid the final farewell to former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, condolences poured in from across the border as well, with several Pakistanis paying her tributes and recalling her Humanity First approach.
From the mother of a toddler with a rare heart disease to a Pakistani woman who married an Indian and sought a permanent visa, Swaraj helped out several Pakistanis in their hour of need.

Rohaan was born with a congenital heart defect on July 29, 2017. Doctors in Pakistan gave him a month to live and recommended immediate open heart surgery. The family got documents prepared to come to India but visas were not issued. Finally, Rohaan’s mother Mehwish Mukhtar (33) from Lahore started an online campaign ‘Help Baby Rohaan’ and tweeted to Swaraj, seeking her help.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“My child was given just a month to live. He needed immediate surgery. Sushma Swaraj responded to our plea on Twitter and got visas issued immediately. My baby’s first surgery was done in India on September 8, 2017. It was successful. She heard us when there was no hope. We respect her for what she did for my son and all children from Pakistan,” Mukhtar told The Indian Express. Rohaan, now two, underwent his second surgery in India in July. He may require a third surgery but he is currently stable.

In September 2016, when tensions soared between India and Pakistan following the Uri attack and the subsequent surgical strikes, a 19-member women delegation from Pakistan was in India to attend the Global Youth Peace Festival in Chandigarh.
Aliya Harir (27), a peace activist from Pakistan who was on the delegation, recalled: “We were worried if we would be able to return safely. Sushma ma’am called me and said, ‘India mein mehmaan bhagwan hota hai…’ A minister spoke to me over like a mother worried for her daughter. She asked organisers to take care of our security and ensured our safe return,” Harir told The Indian Express.

Swaraj also came to the aid of Ramish Aman (28) from Nainital of Uttarakhand and his wife Sidra Rafique (32), from Mansehra district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.
“We married on November 23, 2017 at Rawalpindi, but it wouldn’t have been possible if Sushma ma’am hadn’t responded to my wife’s request on Twitter to grant her permanent visa for stay in India. Sidra’s visa had been rejected twice and my in-laws had said that if it is rejected for the third time, there will be no marriage as she won’t be able to shift to India. It is because of her that we are together,” said Aman.
Sidra said she was overwhelmed by Swaraj responding to her request on Twitter. “She wrote to me..’Sidra- Hindustan apni betiyon aur bahuon ka visa inkaar nahi karta. Tumhe visa zaroor milega…my mother whom I never met is gone,” she said.
Swaraj’s intervention helped Maria (11) and Shayaan (9) — both suffering from thalassemia major — get visa approvals for bone marrow transplant at a Gurgaon hospital. Maria’s father Mohammad Danish said, “We had applied for medical visa, but it wasn’t getting approved. Time was running out and my daughter (then 9) needed immediate bone marrow transplant. I am thankful to Swaraj ma’am that she responded to my tweet immediately.”
In her own words, Sushma Swaraj summed up her ‘Humanity First’ policy when she issued quick visas to Pakistanis on humanitarian grounds. She once tweeted: ‘Dushmani jam kar karo par itni gunjayish rahe, phir kabhi hum dost ban jayein to sharminda na hon… (Don’t practise enmity to such an extent that one day if we become friends again, there is guilt inside)..’"

At a press conference here on Tuesday, Chandra and his team announced a new line-up of shows starting October 3 — a roster that comprises Indian series, a few Turkish dramas, and no Pakistani serial.
“It’s an unfortunate decision that we had to take. When we started Zindagi, I promised Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that we will show their content, we did that, the audience here loved it, and these Pakistani actors entered our living rooms. But then something like Pathankot and Uri happen. If you want to fight, fight at the front, do not attack our soldiers when they are sleeping,” said Chandra. He also said the decision was made a day after the Uri attack.

His team reportedly called up Pakistani actors and musicians — such as Fawad Khan, Mahira Khan, Ali Zafar, Meesha Shafi — after the Uri attack to ask them to condemn it. “Not one of them has, even though we asked them to not mention Pakistan if they didn’t want to,” said Chandra.
Zindagi channel was launched in 2014, and its USP was the content from across the border. It also acquainted viewers in India with names such as Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan.
Joining Chandra on stage were actors, writers and producers of the new shows that will debut on October 3, including actor Anupam Kher, whose company is producing a show titled Khwaabon Ki Zamin Par. “While I still believe that art should have no boundaries, I think these artistes should at least condemn such attacks,” Kher said.
Chandra said that Zindagi still has 3,000 hours of unseen Pakistani content."

The decision to carry out cross-LoC surgical strikes last September was taken at an emergency meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon after terrorists attacked Uri army camp, Home Minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday. “When the news came in September (last year) that terrorists attacked an Army camp (in Uri) and killed 17 jawans, an emergency meeting was convened in which the Prime Minister, the Defence Minister and I, along with officers, took part. A firm decision was taken that a surgical strike will be carried out,” Singh said here.
Indian Special Forces carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launchpads along the LoC in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on the intervening night of September 28 and 29. The Army had said “significant casualties” were inflicted on the terrorists and their supporters in the strikes.

The surgical strikes were carried out 11 days after the terror attack on the army camp in Uri in Kashmir. “Through the surgical strike, we have given out a message to the world that we are not weak but a strong nation,” the Home Minister said while addressing a programme here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said this while asserting that the Prime Minister has been firm in tackling terrorism and the surgical strikes bore testimony to this. Singh recalled that in 2014, he himself had asked BSF “not to count bullets” while replying to Pakistani firing from across the borders.
“In September 2014, I came to know that five people were killed in firing from across the LoC. I immediately called up the BSF DG to inquire what BSF was doing. He told me that BSF had shown white flag 16 times to communicate that BSF wants a dialogue. But there was no response from Pakistan.
“I then ordered the BSF DG that from now on if a single bullet is fired from Pakistani side, BSF should not count its bullets while answering them,” he said.
Singh, however, said that common people of Pakistan, including Muslims, were in favour of good relations with India.
“But unfortunately there are certain elements who want to take the route of terrorism and hatred. Now, from the terror attacks in Pakistan, one can see that terrorists do not have religion, caste or creed,” he said, adding “a terrorist is just a terrorist”."

In the biggest strike on an Indian Army unit since the September 18 Uri attack, terrorists targeted an Army camp at the XVI Corps headquarters in Nagrota near Jammu, killing two officers and five soldiers. In a separate strike, another group of terrorists attacked a BSF patrol at Chamliyal in the Ramgarh sector of Samba district. A BSF DIG was among four injured in the incident. While three terrorists were killed in Nagrota, another three were gunned down at Chamliyal.

In Nagrota, where mopping operations were still on this evening, troops fought back and foiled a hostage situation involving women and children. The terrorists targeted accommodation meant for Army Majors.
Defence spokesperson Lt Colonel Manish Mehta said two officers were among seven Army personnel dead. While the Army has not yet released the names of the dead and injured, official sources identified three of the seven dead as Major Kunal Gosavi of the 166 Medium Regiment, Lance Naik Kadam of 17 Rashtriya Rifles and Sepoy Ragwender of 12 Rashtriya Rifles.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The attacks came three days after Pakistan named General Qamar Javed Bajwa as its new Army chief. He is considered an old Kashmir hand and has done stints with the Pakistan Army’s Rawalpindi-based X Corps which oversees the area along the Line of Control with India.
It is still not clear how the heavily armed terrorists managed to reach Nagrota but official sources believe they sneaked in from the Valley-end. But questions remain on how did they manage to get past at least a dozen nakas and checkposts on the road leading to Nagrota.
Sources said the terrorists, attired in J&K police uniform, scaled a wall and stormed the 166 Medium Regiment premises shortly after 5 am Tuesday, hurling grenades and firing indiscriminately at the sentry post.

According to one account, the terrorists came in a Maruti car, crossed the Ban toll plaza, and after some distance, got off the vehicle and headed straight to the Army camp. Stationed on land which one housed the village of Sarmoi, the 166 Medium Regiment unit forms part of the XVI Corps and is the first stop when one enters Nagrota from the Udhampur-end.
Taking advantage of the dark — it was not yet daylight there at 5 am — the terrorists headed to the accommodation housing Army Majors. There was a bid to take people, including women and children, hostage but that was foiled by troops who fought back.
By afternoon, three terrorists had been shot dead. Troops were still sanitising the premises, looking for anyone who may still be hiding or unexploded ordnance.
At Chamliyal, three terrorists were shot by BSF personnel as they tried to infiltrate with the help of cover fire from Pakistani troops. They were gunned down inside a tubewell room on a farm where they had sought shelter. A BSF constable was injured in the firefight.
Later, three personnel, including DIG Kasana, were injured as they tried to retrieve the bodies of the terrorists. The BSF denied reports that its men were injured because one of the bodies had been booby trapped with an improvised explosive device. D K Upadhyaya, IG BSF, said the DIG and the others were injured in firing from Pakistani troops when they tried to pull out the bodies from the tubewell room.
A high alert has been sounded across the state, including on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway. Security has also been stepped up in Katra town and Vaishno Devi shrine visited everyday by pilgrims from across the country."

India on Friday expressed disappointment over the European Union’s “muted response” to the Uri attack, asserting that terrorism was the “most significant security threat” to both itself and the EU which deserves greater attention.
Proposing scaled up counter-terror cooperation between India and the 27-nation bloc, Secretary (West) in the MEA Sujata Mehta also emphasised on the need for an “effective and comprehensive” global regime under the UN through which the phenomenon of terrorism — whether state sponsored or through non-state actors — be dealt with “firmly and effectively”.

Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari recently tweeted that the government had decided to stop India’s share of waters in the Indus river system from flowing into Pakistan. Coming amidst noisy calls for a strong retaliation against the Pulwama terror attack, Gadkari’s statement seemed to indicate a new policy direction from the government. That clearly was not the case, as the government also clarified after some time. The policy direction had, in fact, changed more than two years earlier — in the wake of another terrorist attack, on an Army camp in Uri in September 2016.
After the Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that “blood and water” could not flow together, and India had temporarily suspended regular meetings of the Indus Commissioners of the two countries.
A much bigger shift was signalled a few weeks later, when India decided to exert much greater control over the waters of the Indus basin, while continuing to adhere to the provisions of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty that governs the sharing of these waters with Pakistan. A high-level task force was set up under the stewardship of the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister to ensure that India makes full use of the waters it is entitled to under the Treaty.
Rights to be utilisedhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India has not been utilising its full claims, and letting much more water flow to Pakistan than has been committed under the Treaty.
The Indus Waters Treaty gives India full control over the waters of the three Eastern rivers, Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — ‘Eastern’ because they flow east of the ‘Western’ rivers — while letting the waters of the three Western rivers of Indus, Jhelum and Chenab flow “unrestricted” to Pakistan. India is allowed to make some use of the waters of the Western rivers as well, including for purposes of navigation, power production and irrigation, but it must do so in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5599478 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/indus-graph.jpg"" alt=""Explained: India's policy shift in sharing Indus waters with Pakistan"" /> Click image to enlarge
Historically, India has never made full use of its rights, neither on the Eastern nor on the Western rivers. On the Western rivers specifically, there has been no pressing demand for creation of new infrastructure on the Indus rivers, either for hydroelectricity or irrigation. With a large proportion of farmers in Jammu and Kashmir having moved to horticulture from traditional crops, the demand for irrigation has gone down over the years. After the devastating floods of 2014, it was argued that storage infrastructure could have been built on these rivers as a flood-control measure.
As a result of India’s under-utilisation of its share of waters, Pakistan has over the years benefited more than it is entitled to under the Treaty. Pakistan’s dependence on the waters of the Indus basin cannot be overstated. More than 95% of Pakistan’s irrigation infrastructure is in the Indus basin — about 15 million hectares of land. It has now become the world’s largest contiguous irrigation system, comprising over 60,000 km of canals. Three of Pakistan’s biggest dams, including Mangla, which is one of the largest in the world, is built on the Jhelum river. These dams produce a substantial proportion of Pakistan’s electricity.
Post Uri, India’s decision to change the status quo and use more waters of the Indus rivers was made with the calculation that it would hurt the interests of Pakistan, which has become used to the excess water and built its infrastructure around it.
What moved after Uri
The high-level task force recommended the revival of several projects that were either suspended or had remained on paper for several years. Many of these projects were in Jammu and Kashmir; others were in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Some of these projects were put on fast-track mode, declared national projects, and money was sanctioned to resume works.
One that moved quickly was the 800MW Bursar hydroelectric project on the Marusudar river, one of the tributaries of the Chenab, in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir. Under direct monitoring of the Prime Minister’s Office, a revised detailed project report was finalised, prompt environmental clearance was granted, and an attractive rehabilitation package for affected families was disbursed. Recently, work has also been started. Bursar will be India’s first project on the Western rivers to have storage infrastructure.
The same happened with the Shahpur-Kandi project in Gurdaspur district of Punjab, work on which was stalled for several years because of a dispute between the governments of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. In March 2017, the Centre summoned the representatives of the two states, brokered a solution, and directed that work be resumed.
A much bigger project, the 1,856-MW Sawalkot project on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir, was also given the final go-ahead in 2017, and work is expected to start soon. Similar is the case of the Ujh project in Jammu and Kashmir.
Officials say more than 30 projects are under various stages of implementation on the Western rivers, having got the final approvals. Many of these were started after the change in policy in 2016. Many of them have been accorded the status of national projects. Another eight projects are said to be in the planning stage.
Pakistan’s claims
Even before India’s shift in policy, Pakistan had often complained that it was being denied its due share of waters, and that India had violated the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty in the manner it had designed and implemented many of its projects on the Indus rivers. In the last few years, several Pakistani academics have argued that the Treaty has failed to protect the interests of Pakistan, and that India has managed to manipulate the provisions in its favour.
The result has been an increasing number of objections being raised by Pakistan on the projects that are coming up in India. The two countries have permanent Indus Water Commissions that meet regularly not just to share information and data, but also to resolve disputes. Until a few years ago, most of these disputes would be resolved through this bilateral mechanism. The dispute over the Baglihar dam was the first one that Pakistan referred to the World Bank, which had brokered the Indus Waters Treaty.
Baglihar, which was adjudicated upon by a neutral expert, did not go Pakistan’s way. In the case of the Kishanganga project, where the matter was referred to a Court of Arbitration, a higher level of conflict resolution under the Treaty, Pakistan managed to get a partially favourable decision. Some disputes over the Kishanganga have remained unresolved and are currently being addressed.
In recent years, Pakistan has raised objections on many other projects, including the Ratle project, the Pakal Dul dam, and Sawalkot. Officials say the main objective of Pakistan seems to be to delay these projects, thereby forcing a cost escalation and making them economically unviable.
Last month, the Indus Commissioner of Pakistan was in India to visit some of these projects, as can be done once in five years in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty."

File
EVEN As New Delhi takes a hard look at the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan, cross-LoC trade, closed for the last three months, resumed Tuesday in Uri, where an Army installation was attacked by terrorists on September 18.
Cross-LoC trade was suspended after protests erupted in Kashmir over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an encounter on July 8. The ensuing violence and curfew made it difficult for traders on both sides of the LoC to send goods.

But on Tuesday, 12 trucks carrying embroidery items, handicraft and spices left from the Salamabad trade centre in Uri for Chikoti in PoK, while one truck carrying dry fruit items arrived in Uri from PoK.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The vehicles crossed the LoC around 1 pm in the presence of senior Army and civil administration officials from both sides.
Custodian, cross-LoC trade, Farooq Ahmad Shah told The Indian Express that the trade will continue for the next three days. “We had a meeting with officials from PoK at zero point this afternoon and the trade crossing took place at 1 pm at Kaman bridge,” Shah said.
“The other side wanted trade to resume. We initiated the process at a meeting chaired by Deputy Commissioner, Baramulla, recently. The decision to resume trade was communicated to officials from the other side of the LoC,” Shah said.
“Due to tension in Uri, many traders were sceptical (on the first day), but from tomorrow, I hope the frequency of trucks will go up,” Shah said, adding that cross-LoC trade will help defuse tension in Uri.
Hilal Turki, general secretary of the cross-LoC trade union, said, “We had taken a decision to resume trade last week, but after the Uri attack, it was deferred.”
Cross-LoC trade is among the confidence building measures initiated by India and Pakistan after the start of the Karvan-e-Aman or Peace Bus on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road. There are 800 registered traders and trade is currently conducted using the barter system."

In an incident reminiscent of the 2016 Uri attack, militants stormed a paramilitary training centre at Lethpora in South Kashmir in the wee hours on Sunday and killed four CRPF personnel while three others received bullet injuries. CRPF officials said two militants who were hiding in a nearby camp were gunned down and a combing operation was underway.
While there has been no official confirmation, IANS reported that Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) had claimed responsibility for the attack on the 185 battalion CRPF training camp in Pulwama district’s Lethpora area.
Heavily armed militants ambushed the camp at around 2.10 am after hurling grenades and resorted to indiscriminate firing during which four CRPF personnel were killed. While one of them died on the spot, the other three succumbed to injuries in the hospital. “They were armed with under-barrel grenade launchers and automatic weapons. They were challenged by camp sentries,” PTI quoted CRPF officials as saying.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Personnel from Rashtriya Rifles, CRPF and state police soon cordoned off the camp and flushed out the two ultras. One of the injured personnel was identified as Saifuddin, a resident of Nowgam.
The attack comes days after India claimed it killed three Pakistani soldiers in a cross-LoC attack. The raid had come in retaliation for the killing of four Indian soldiers, including a Major, by Pakistani troops in Keri sector last week.

(Source: ANI)
Despite receiving a tip-off about an impending fidayeen strike, the security forces failed to prevent the attack. Director General of Police S P Vaid termed the attack “unfortunate” and lashed out at Pakistan. He asserted as long as Pakistan kept sending militants, security forces and people of Kashmir would continue to go through such turmoil.
“There was an input from the last two-three days.They (militants) were trying.They probably could not get a place and time earlier.So, they struck last night,” Vaid told reporters.
Congress took the opportunity to castigate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Pulwama attack is a sign of failure of PM Narendra Modi’s foreign policy,” ANI quoted Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev as saying. J&K Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh minced no words as he slammed Pakistan for the attack. “In desperation and frustration, Pakistan does cross-border firing, attacks our posts, kills our civilians. We are replying to them and they are facing defeat. Pakistan has been exposed and isolated on the diplomatic front,” Singh said.
The attack comes on the heels of the killing of a top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) ‘commander’, Noor Mohammad Tantray, who was gunned down in an encounter in Samboora village in Pulwama district of South Kashmir earlier on Tuesday. As the JeM’s ‘divisional commander’ in South Kashmir, he was reported to have played an instrumental role in reviving the outfit.
On September 18, 2016, militants stormed the Brigade headquarters in Uri after cutting the fence and killed 19 soldiers in one of the worst militant attacks in Valley. Several barracks of the fortified camp were also burnt to ashes in the attack.

Jammu and Kashmir has suffered losses due to the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan and should be compensated by the Centre, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said today, two days after India decided to “exploit to the maximum” the water of Pak-controlled rivers.
“Today, many things are being talked about. There is a talk of IWT… We are facing losses on account of IWT. We should get compensation and we cannot ask Pakistan for that but our own country. Whatever we get, be it our power projects or anything, we should get,” she said at a function here.
Under the Treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, control of three rivers flowing through Jammu and Kashmir — Jhelum, Indus and Chenab — was given to Pakistan while India was given control over Beas, Ravi and Sutlej, all passing through Punjab.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Because of the treaty, no big dams or power projects can be built by India on Jhelum, Indus or Chenab.
“There have been so many wars, but IWT wasn’t touched because both the countries benefited from our resources, even as J and K suffered losses,” Mehbooba said while speaking at the launch of PM Ujwala Yojana.
Her remarks came two days after the Prime Minister asserted that “Blood and water cannot flow together” and decided that India will “exploit to the maximum” the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum.
Held amidst heightened tension between the India and Pakistan, the meeting also decided to set up a inter- ministerial task forces to go into the details and working of the Treaty with a “sense of urgency”, senior government sources said.
She said her father and former Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had wanted joint use of resources by both the countries for friendship between them.
“Mufti sahab always had this thinking that we should both do such things so that we can use our resources jointly for our as well as their benefit so that there is friendship instead of animosity. But unfortunately, even as there were many attempts, it has not happened so far,” she said.
The chief minister said she had hoped Prime Minister Narendra Modi would visit Pakistan for the SAARC summit in November but noted that he cannot go under the circumstances following Uri attack.
“SAARC was to happen in Pakistan and I had hopes that our PM will get an opportunity to go there but how will he go? Under what circumstances will he go there?” she said.
India, along with Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan, have decided not to attend the 8-nation Summit because of unabated cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, the venue."

Gilani said Irrfan, who died in April this year, is much loved in Pakistan. “Irrfan Khan’s team was looking to cast someone from Pakistan. They had seen my work in Mata-e-Jaan Hai Tu and they had liked it. I think it was a for a film. They got in touch with Mehreen Jabbar, who is the director of our show, and got my contact through her. She told me that somebody from India had called and they were looking to cast somebody opposite Irrfan Khan. The exchange was happening and unfortunately the political drama happened and things didn’t materialise,” Gilani told PTI in an interview over phone from Karachi.

Gilani said she was heart broken when the barriers were put between two countries. “I could only imagine how amazing it would have been to just see Irrfan Khan and how he acts, he is so amazing. Sadly he isn’t with us. My mother cried so much on his death. He is much loved in Pakistan and people look up to his work here,” Gilani said, adding, The Lunchbox, Piku, were some of her favourite films of the late actor.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In the aftermath of Uri attack in 2016, Pakistani artistes have been barred from working in Indian film and music industry though there is no official ban.

Gilani believes people are not against each other but politics prevents the exchange of art and music between the two neighbours.
“We are always starving for Indian films to come and take on our cinema, our entire community is into Bollywood. When it comes to music, I feel Pakistani artistes have contributed to Indian market, we have amazing artiste like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shafaqat Amanat Ali, Atif Aslam, Ali Zafar, etc.”
Gilani is thrilled about the release of her path-breaking web-series “Churails”, which premiered on newly re-launched Zindagi on the streamer ZEE5. The series directed by Cake helmer Asim Abbasi, narrates the story of four self-proclaimed ‘churails’, who unite to open a covert detective agency to expose cheating husbands amongst the city’s elite.
The actor said both in real and reel life the myth around women who goes out is considered to be outspoken and the one who takes care of the house is good, is unreal and Abbasi is trying to break this steroetype.
Citing example of popular Pakistani shows like “Bandh Darwajo Ke Pichche”, “Saat Kahaniya” Gilani said due to the censor board one couldn’t portray a realistic image of a woman and it had to be sugarcoated.

“The stories are fictional. There is not much reality attached to it, although we see same stories in news everyday. Like a guy spilling acid on a woman because she refused to marry him. But we don’t want to talk about it in the entertainment sector, we want to sugarcoat the story. Asim wants to break this thing. In Churails we didn’t need a man to rescue a woman, we wanted to show that a woman can stand for herself and uplift other women going through problems.”
Gilani said to play the character of Sara, a former lawyer whose seemingly perfect life – a handsome and wealthy spouse and three children, comes undone one day, leading her to a different path.
Gilani said she took inspiration from Meryl Streep’s 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada to play the character.

“In TV and films, you have to emote a lot for the audience to feel the pain or happiness but in web it had to be altered to zero. I had to unlearn and start new.  In The Devil Wears Prada, Streep doesn’t say much but her aura is so powerful. I even got inspired by Angelina’s film Mr and Mrs Smith, I wanted to take that subtleness. Basically, I adapted the subtleness of these strong personalities in my character.”"

India has “outmanoeuvred” Pakistan by effectively branding it as a “regional pariah” during Goa BRICS-BIMSTEC summit where the country presented itself as a “bright spot”, strengthening its case for the NSG membership and a permanent seat in UNSC, state-run Chinese media said on Wednesday.
“Given the uneasy background of Indo-Pak tension, which escalated last month, India’s inclusion of BIMSTEC (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) bore even thicker geo-strategic connotations,” an article in the state-run Global Times said.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“As India invited all countries in the region except Pakistan, it in effect consigned Pakistan to be a regional pariah,” the article titled ‘India uses BRICS to outmanoeuvre Pakistan’, it said.
Referring to India’s decision not to attend the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit to be held in Islamabad after the Uri attack, it said, “The collapse of the SAARC summit presented India a rare opportunity to get rid of any constraints Islamabad may have over the regional group, as the same group would soon gather in Goa in the absence of Pakistan”.
BIMSTEC also made a major difference for India at the Goa summit, it said.
“A major difference between the Goa summit and the previous ones was that New Delhi put the (BIMSTEC) in tandem with the BRICS meeting,” it said.
By bringing regional countries – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan – together with the major emerging economies of the BRICS, the daily said, India breathed legitimacy and substance into an otherwise “hallow and moribund acronym organisation”.

“While the rest of the BRICS members would never openly endorse either side in the Indo-Pak tension, India in a way secured its stance vis-à-vis Pakistan by taking advantages of its agenda-setting powers for the summits,” it said.
“While the prospect of BIMSTEC as a more effective alternative to SAARC remains ambiguous, a subcontinent grouping without Pakistan balancing and checking a dominant India may well raise suspicions and fear for smaller countries,” it said.
The summit also helped India to push for its membership in the NSG, which was blocked by China, as well as for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council (UNSC), it said.
“The BRICS summit brings India an ideal mechanism to articulate and push for its reformist demands together with like-minded countries. This common front became particularly valuable for New Delhi, especially as its arduous bids for Nuclear Suppliers Group’s (NSG) membership as well as for a permanent seat on an enlarged United Nation Security Council have both met frustration,” it said.

The daily said that India successfully projected itself as the fastest growing economy compared to other members of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).
“During the summit, India presented itself as a bright spot in a bloc whose other members have been buffeted by economic headwinds to varying degrees. With a GDP growth rate of 7.5 per cent in 2015 against a rather gloomy global backdrop, India has replaced China as the world’s fastest-growing large economy,” the article said.
“Only three years ago, India was still labeled as one of the ‘RIBS’, whose feeble and volatile growth contrasted sharply to China’s robust performance. Nowadays, the Russian and Brazilian economies have deteriorated into recession, South Africa struggles to avoid the same fate, and China’s decades-long economic boom has geared down,” it said.
“But India finds confidence in talking about economic matters. After all, the setbacks undergone by its fellow countries made India’s recent economic achievements shine even brighter in comparison,” it said.
“Although India’s domestic reforms have only made limited inroads in key areas such as land acquisition and labour regulation, an aspirant (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi equipped with newly-gained confidence on India’s growth prospects has clearly made the country more proactive,” it said.
For India, the daily said, this BRICS summit has been a wonderful platform to coordinate efforts in reforming current global economic and finance governance.
“This effect becomes more visible as the operationalisation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) have put pressures on the current international finance system, giving India tangible leverage in demanding relevant reforms,” it said.
For example, the Goa Declaration urges advanced European economies to cede two chairs on the Executive Board of the IMF, to which India may have an “upper hand to claim thanks to its huge potential and robust growth recently,” it said."

Within days of the Uri attack, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has asked Pakistani actors to leave India within 48 hours. The threat came from Amey Khopkar of MNS Chitrapat Sena. “We give a 48 hour deadline to Pakistani actors and artists to leave India or MNS will push them out,” he said in a statement.
Top actors such as Fawad Khan, Ali Zafar, Mahira Khan, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Imran Abbas and Mawra Hocane are among a host of Pakistani artistes who have made India their home away from home. Fawad, in particular, has a number of big-ticket Bollywood projects in hand. Will the MNS threat affect their films and careers?

This comes at a time of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after terrorists killed 18 Army personnel at an Army camp in Uri, Kashmir. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Shiv Sena had in the past forced noted ghazal singer Ghulam Ali to cancel his performance in Mumbai.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has claimed that the Uri terror attack could be the result of a ‘reaction’ of the people to the situation in Kashmir as he criticised India for blaming Pakistan ‘without any evidence’.
“The Uri attack can be the reaction of the atrocities in Kashmir, as the close relatives and near and dear ones of those killed and blinded over the last two months were hurt and outraged,” Sharif told reporters on Friday in London where he had stopped on his way back from New York after attending the UN General Assembly session.

Sharif said that India hastily blamed Pakistan without any investigation. He said India behaved in an ‘irresponsible way’ when it blamed Pakistan ‘without any evidence’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“How could India accuse Pakistan only hours after the Uri incident without holding any inquiry or investigation,” Sharif was quoted as saying by Pakistani media reports.
“The whole world knows about the Indian atrocities” in Kashmir where around “108 people have so far been killed, over 150 blinded and thousands injured,” he alleged.
Stressing on alleged “brutalities being perpetrated against innocent Kashmiris”, the Pakistani Prime Minister said that before accusing Pakistan, India should have looked at its “atrocious role” in Kashmir.
He called on India to also conduct a probe into the ‘killings’ of Kashmiris.
Sharif said the achievement of lasting peace in the region was impossible without the resolution of Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
18 soldiers were killed when Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists attacked a highly-guarded army camp in Uri in Kashmir on Sunday morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that those behind the despicable act will not go unpunished.
The incident triggered a diplomatic dust-up with both India and Pakistan hitting out at each other including at the UN General Assembly."

Filmmaker Karan Johar today began shooting for the upcoming fifth season of his popular celebrity chat show Koffee With Karan. Karan Johar, 44, shared with fans, on Twitter, that he shot the promo of the edition.
“Started the #koffeewithkaran shoot today… shot the promo! This Season…things are hotting up…

@StarWorldIndia,” the director tweeted alongside a photo of himself holding the famous “coffee with mug” “(this time yellow in colour).

There have been reports that two of Johar’s closest people from Bollywood– superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt– will be the first guests on this season. Interestingly, the pair shares screen space in director Gauri Shindey’s next, Dear Zindagi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Koffee With Karan, which premiered in 2004, is known for the uninhibited chatter between the host and his celebrity guests that has often led to gossips, spats and controversies in Bollywood.
Just days before, it was a merry-making time for the fans of Fawad Khan. Reports had surfaced that Karan Johar had picked the Pakistani actor instead of his favourite, Shah Rukh Khan, as the first guest on the upcoming season of Koffee With Karan. But all hell broke lose when Fawad and other Pakistani artists found themselves under fire after the Uri attack and MNS asking them to leave India.

Whether or not this can be cited as the reason, but now we hear that Karan has gone back to SRK to open the sixth season of his celebrity chat-show. Shah Rukh will be appearing on the episode with Alia Bhatt to promote their upcoming film Dear Zindagi. Yes, Fawad has been dropped as its first guest!

From day one the Gandhi family and its courtiers have made it clear that they would never accept a ‘chaiwala’ from Gujarat as prime minister. When the results of the general election came on that hot summer day in 2014, indicating a full majority for the BJP and 44 seats for the Congress, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi accepted defeat in a sulky, graceless sort of way. They congratulated the ‘new government’ that had not yet been formed but refused to mention the hated Narendra Modi’s name. Remember? By the next morning, articles written by their devoted courtiers prophesying India’s descent into darkness appeared in newspapers, including this one. A particularly devoted devotee trotted off to Pakistan weeks later and asked for help to oust Modi on a Pakistani news channel.
When a dynasty has remained in power for nearly all of India’s years as an independent nation, it is not easy to accept that some little commoner from Gujarat should usurp the throne. So the relationship between the Congress and the Modi government has been bitter, ugly and acrimonious. The fools who keep suggesting that the Prime Minister ‘reach out’ to the Opposition have no idea what they are talking about. But even keeping these things in mind, Rahul Gandhi’s charge last week that the Prime Minister was doing ‘khoon ki dalali’ with the blood of dead soldiers was beyond belief. His Hindi is limited but even he must know that the word ‘dalaal’ is mostly used as a pejorative term for pimps. So when he charged the Prime Minister with pimping the blood of dead soldiers did he understand that he was defiling the memory of men who died for India?
Ever since 19 soldiers were killed in the Uri attack, we have watched small boys, barely old enough to walk, lighting the pyres of fathers killed in Pakistan’s ugly, undeclared war. It has been a haunting, horrible sight. So when the Indian Army retaliated with a strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, most Indians felt proud. Naturally Pakistan’s military rulers denied that anything happened. It is their default response. It was their response to 26/11 despite Ajmal Kasab being caught alive. It has been their response every time a jihadi attack has revealed the hand of the ISI. These are men who even denied that they knew Osama bin Laden and his many wives and children lived for years in a huge house inside the garrison town of Abbottabad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Today most countries regard Pakistan as a rogue state that uses jihadi terrorism as a tool of its foreign policy. In view of jihadism being widely regarded as the Nazism of our times, Pakistan is increasingly being acknowledged as the most dangerous Islamic Republic of all since it has a huge stock of nuclear weapons and continues to make more. Until the Indian Army conducted its ‘surgical strikes’, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif made daily threats of nuclear war.
Unsurprisingly, most Indians are proud that the Prime Minister showed the political will to ignore this nuclear blackmail. But, the Congress party was left confused and unhappy. So some of its leaders began by praising the ‘armed forces’ as if they could have acted without political support. Then when it became clear that the ‘surgical strikes’ were hugely popular, they started grumbling about how they had done similar strikes but never taken credit politically. Why not? After 26/11 and the beheading of our soldiers, most Indians wanted some kind of retaliation, so where was the need for secrecy?
Rahul Gandhi’s response to the ‘surgical strikes’ was the most confused of all. He welcomed them but added that it was the first time in more than two years that he had seen the Prime Minister behave ‘prime ministerial’. Days later he charged him with ‘pimping’ the blood of dead soldiers. For a start it is not at all clear what he meant by this, but whatever he meant, it showed contempt for the young men who die every day protecting India’s borders against an increasingly belligerent neighbour.
It is possible that Rahul Gandhi did not fully understand what he was saying. It is possible that he thought of this as yet another clever one-liner, but he seems not just to have misunderstood what he was saying but also misunderstood the threat India faces from Pakistan’s jihadist military assets. WikiLeaks reported five years ago that Rahul once told an American ambassador that he believed Hindu terrorism was a bigger threat to India than jihadist terrorism. Does he still believe this? If he does, then it is time for some more political science lessons and some lessons in current affairs. No man who seeks to become India’s prime minister can remain oblivious to the ugly possibility of a nuclear war being started by some jihadist general from the Islamic Republic next door."

(File photo)
AS the unrest which began soon after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July enters day 89 and despite tensions between India and Pakistan, there is calm on the Line of Control (LoC) in the Valley. After the army’s “surgical strikes’’ in the PoK last week, villagers living close to LoC right from Uri upto Gurez apprehended a new phase of cross border shelling between Indian and Pakistani troops on the LoC and a return of the old days when people were forced to migrate for the sake of their lives as shells and mortars landed right in residential areas.
In the past one week in Jammu, there have been constant violations of the ceasefire between Indian and Pakistani soldiers that has led to some panic among the civilian population living there; however, in Kashmir no significant incident has taken place along the LoC. Villagers in Uri, Tangdhar and Gurez areas, especially those who live at the zero line, have not left their homes and the ceasefire holds despite occasional violations.

Meanwhile, two big Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) initiated by India and Pakistan from 2004 to 2008 – the running of Karvan-e-Aman or Peace Bus between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad every week and the resumption of cross LoC trade — continue and many see this as a good omen for peace and an indication that the situation between the two countries will not deteriorate further.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the Uri attack and another attack on the battalion headquarters of the 46 RR in the garrison town of Baramulla, there was fear among the locals as well as the security officials that in the coming days, attacks may increase as militants had managed to sneak into the Valley during past three months and establish their bases across Kashmir– some local youths have also reportedly joined the militant ranks.
The Uri and Baramulla attacks have seen the return of additional checkpoints in and around sensitive spots in the city as there are fears that militants are waiting for an opportunity to strike.
Since July, the separatist leadership had been rolling out a protest calendar every week. However, since last week, there has been a significant increase in the flow of traffic on the roads and government employees have begun to attend offices regularly although shops remain closed and open only during the relaxation period given by the separatists."

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday hit back at his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, saying poverty cannot be eradicated by “driving tanks on farmlands” and once again needled India by calling Hizbul commander Burhan Wani a “son of the Kashmiri soil”.
Responding to Modi’s speech last month challenging Pakistan to a contest over eradicating poverty and other social ills, Sharif said, “If they (Indian leaders) want us to fight them to end poverty, then they should realise that poverty cannot be eradicated by driving tanks on farmlands.”

Sharif, while addressing a joint session of the Parliament convened to discuss the security situation in the wake of increasing Indo-Pak tensions, accused India of running away from dialogue and instead creating a war-like environment by blaming Pakistan for the Uri terror attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed last month.
“We have done everything to make India come to the dialogue table, but India did not let it happen. Our efforts were thwarted over and over again,” Sharif claimed.
“Without any investigation (into Uri incident), within a few hours, India blamed Pakistan for the attack,” he said.
Sharif accused India of having some “motives” in blaming Pakistan for the Uri attack when it was “not even established” that who was involved in it.
The Pakistan Prime Minister also accused India of violating the LoC ceasefire agreement and launching “aggression” against Pakistan.

“India’s ceasefire violation resulted in the death of our two soldiers, when it attacked Pakistan. It was befittingly responded and was conveyed that Pakistan Army is fully capable to respond to any aggression,” he said.
Sharif also expressed support for Kashmiris and said the issue should be resolved according to the wishes of people of Kashmir and the UN resolutions.
“The Kashmiri youth have taken it upon themselves to carry on the movement of freedom against Indian aggression and atrocities,” Sharif said.
He again mentioned Wani in his speech.
“The death of Burhan Wani, son of the Kashmiri soil, had reminded India to give Kashmiris their right to self-determination,” Sharif said.
Raking up Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, Sharif had called Wani a “young leader”, evoking a strong reaction from India.
Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, sparking off protests in the Valley."

Congress on Monday expressed deep disappointment over Sushma Swaraj’s address in the UN, insisting that the Modi government has “failed us again by its meek response” by not calling Pakistan a “terror state”. “Deeply disappointed by EAM Sushma Swaraj’s address in UN. Even steered shy of calling Pak a ‘terror state’. Strategic ambiguity writ large,” Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a series of tweets.
The tweets followed External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in which she sharply rebuked the Pakistan’s tirade on Kashmir. “If India won’t determinedly ask for diplomatic & economic sanctions against Pak in UN, who will? Modi Govt again failed us by meek response.”
“Why is EAM Sushmaji shy of calling ‘a spade a spade’ in UN? Why did we not call upon UN for diplomatic & economic sanctions against Pakistan?”, he said. Another Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said whenever an Indian representative speaks on foreign soil, it is not the time for politics as the entire country stands behind him or her.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The whole country is with Sushma Swaraj, she did a valiant effort,” Singhvi said. Singhvi, however, hoped that government should have taken some concrete steps against Pakistan before going to the United Nations.
Surjewala asked as to “Why did EAM forget to place Pak sponsored terrorist attacks in Gurdaspur, Udhampur & 2attacks in Pompore in UN? Modi Govt placating Pakistan still?” Surjewala said that the nation wants concrete action against rogue Pakistan not aimless political acronyms and rhetoric as seen in UN.

“They have not called a Parliament session to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, they have not done anything to withdraw the MFN status, they have not imposed severe economic sanctions against Pakistan, no scale down of high commissions.
“They have not done anything on ground for concrete actions, yes some efforts to isolate Pakistan globally but that’s not enough. These had to be done before we reached UN, then our case would have resonated better, that’s our unfulfilled aspirations,” Singhvi said.
He added, “domestic concrete actions by government is not behind her to strengthen her. I had asked earlier that had Sushma gone to United Nations on the 10th day from the Uri attack with certain concrete steps taken by the government instead of Prime Minister’s address at Kerala, cabinet meet and ‘jumlas’, her position would have been stronger.”"

Pakistan on Wednesday appealed to the Afghan Taliban to shun violence and join the peace process as it pledged another USD 500 million to the war-torn country for reconstruction work.
“Our message to Taliban remains to shun violence and to join the peace process,” Foreign Office (FO) quoted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz as saying.

Aziz, while addressing the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan where India hit out at Pakistan for blocking Indo-Afghan trade via Attari border for “political reasons”, emphasised that politically negotiated settlement was the most viable option for bringing lasting peace to Afghanistan.
He also welcomed the peace deal signed between Afghan government and Hezb-i-Islami militant outfit assuring Pakistan’s continued efforts for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan through the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG).
FO said Aziz pledged the fresh money for economic development projects in Afghanistan.

“Aziz underlined importance of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan for Pakistan and announced of Pakistan’s fresh pledge of USD 500 million for economic development projects in Afghanistan.
“This is in addition to USD 500 million existing package under which projects in infrastructure, education and health are nearing completion,” it said.
The Brussels Conference is being held as a sequel to the Tokyo Conference that took place in 2012 for affirming the international community’s engagement with Afghanistan through economic and financial assistance for Afghanistan."

Shah Rukh Khan has been missing out from onscreen action for a while now. However, a few glimpses from Koffee With Karan season 5 reflects his enduring charm, sense of humour and ability to improvise.
When a bemused Karan Johar asked what he would do if he woke up as Alia Bhatt, Shah Rukh quipped, “I will just read the newspapers.” An embarrassed Alia Bhatt made a pretty picture. Shah Rukh didn’t just stop there. When Karan asked why he couldn’t make it to the last season, Shah Rukh remarked, “Because I wanted the TRPs to go down.”

Karan Johar shared this 30 seconds video on his Twitter account and captioned it, “#koffeewithkaran season 5!! Starts 6th November….the season opener with @iamsrk and @aliaa08 on @StarWorldIndia #KWKonSW.”
The interaction between a 50-year-old Shah Rukh, 23-year-old Alia Bhatt with an equally interesting host Karan Johar is must watch. Both Shah Rukh and Alia are teaming up for the first time in their upcoming movie Dear Zindagi, directed by Gauri Shinde.

This year’s Koffee With Karan has been exactly like KJo’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil — in the center of several rumours. It all began with the news that Karan has replaced his favourite SRK with Fawad Khan as the first guest. Then the tension between India and Pakistan escalated after Uri attacks and Fawad was firmly put out of the picture. Karan then went back to SRK.

Alia also seems to be Karan’s lucky charm these days. While earlier Kajol was the obvious choice for Koffee, now it seems it is Alia. She is also playing a guest appearance in ADHM, which stars Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Fawad is seen in a cameo."

In Dirty Picture, Silk (Vidya Balan) had claimed that films serve only three purposes — entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. But sometimes it does more than that. Although Bollywood has been branded as a hub for masala movies, if one reads between the lines, you will find films which have explained complicated global issues in a simple form. How well did you know about one of the largest civilian evacuation in history when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait before Airlift? How many knew about the existence of Masterda Surya Sen before Chittagong and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se? Very few of us probably knew how many times MS Dhoni failed before he found his big break till we watched MS Dhoni: The untold story. Films sometimes help us attain a clearer idea of the system we are all tangled in. Accepted that they often end up being slightly biased but at the end of the day, one can form an opinion of their own based on the facts which are provided.
Here are 10 incidents that shook the nation in 2016, and we would love to watch a film on it.
Panama Papers

A film on Panama Papers will be directed by Steven Soderbergh but nothing has been finalised and officially announced as of yet. Nevertheless, nothing is better than a desi touch of an international incident that involves faces of popular Bollywood star like Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter in law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Both have denied any involvement in the matter.

The Panama Papers have been the biggest international leak this year which reveals detailed personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public official, which had previously been kept private. There’s nothing illegal about having offshore business entities but reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, kleptocracy, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.

On the 8th of November, while the world was busy covering the American elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi jumped in and made an announcement that pretty much came out of syllabus for all journalists. Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were no longer said to be a legal tender. Indians were asked to get their cash exchanged and there was a limit to how much one can withdraw or exchange. No sooner was this announcement made, ATMs and banks faced long queues and if all queues of the nation would have been clubbed together, it would have probably reached the space. The reason behind this move was to curb black money in the economy. While some approved of the move, others like Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal called it draconian. One can’t help but wonder who can play Modi the best if a movie is ever made on demonetisation.

Following Uri attacks, India claimed that it had conducted surgical strikes against militant launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistani-administered parts of Kashmir, and inflicted significant casualties. Media reports said that there were around 35 to 50 casualty figures. But Pakistan rejected the claims stating that the Indian army had not crossed the Line of Control but had only had skirmishes with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and wounding of nine.

Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who once claimed himself to be the king of good times, left the country despite bearing a debt of Rs 9,091 crore. This happened despite banks moving the Supreme Court to restrain Mallya from leaving India and seize his passport. The banks also sought the issue of an arrest warrant against him and a security deposit to ensure his presence at the debt recovery tribunal proceedings in Bengaluru. The Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament had reportedly left Indian shores a full six days before the banks approached the apex court.

The Jat agitation was a reservation stir in February 2016 by Jats, which “paralysed the state for 10 days.The protesters sought inclusion of their caste in the Other Backward Class (OBC) category, which would make them eligible for affirmative action benefits. Besides Haryana, the protests also spread to the neighbouring states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi.

A protest by students of Jawaharlal Nehru University on “judicial killing” of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhatt divided the nation as anti-India slogans were allegedly heard at the protest. JNU instituted an enquiry, which said permission was not given to the protest.

PV Sindhu is an Indian professional badminton player. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic silver medal. She is one of the two Indian badminton players to ever win an Olympic medal – other being Saina Nehwal. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Dangal, Sultan, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Mary Kom, have been a proofs that biopics can be a big hit if directed properly.

Sakshi Malik is an Indian wrestler. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she won the bronze medal in the 58 kg category, becoming the first Indian female wrestler to win a medal at the Olympics and the fourth female Olympic medallist from the country. The success of Dangal might pave ways for Bollywood directors to consider making a film based on Sakshi Malik.

When the anchor, known for his take-no-prisoners style of interviewing the guests on his show, resigned from the channel, it made news all across the country.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today condemned the terrorist attack on the army base in Uri in Kashmir in which 18 soldiers were yesterday killed.
“No words can take away the pain of the 17 families who lost their loved ones in #Uri. India’s brave soldiers, salutes. Mortal remains of one brave jawan is being brought to Howrah (sic),” she tweeted.

In one of the deadliest attacks on the army in recent years, 17 jawans were killed and 19 others injured as heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based Jaish-e- Mohammed, stormed a battalion headquarters of the force in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours yesterday."

Actor-turned-BJP leader Locket Chatterjee, who visited the house of Sepoy Ghorai on Wednesday, said, “This government announces a paltry sum for someone who has died for the country. It is shameful. This is the same amount that the government offers to someone who has died after drinking bad hooch. Is a soldier and a drunkard the same?” she said. “This will not be tolerated anymore. Those who have done this, will be given a just answer,” she added. Meanwhile social media platforms slammed the Mamata govenment, pointing out that it had offered the family of a Haj pilgrim who had died a compensation of Rs 10 lakh."

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said war with Pakistan should be “the last resort” for India as both the countries are nuclear-armed. “Both the countries (India and Pakistan) are nuclear-armed. Therefore, war should be the last resort (before India). All efforts should be made to negotiate and put pressure on Pakistan,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a Congress workers’ meeting in Panaji. “What is happening is that even Russia, which was our consistent friend, is now doing exercises with Pakistan which has never happened before in the past,” Singh said.
“These are the areas of concern which the BJP-led government should be looking at,” said the Congress general secretary. He said what was happening in Kashmir was a “matter of concern for all of us”.
“The Congress party has always supported the government in power in matters of external and internal security. Now, the Congress party should plan a campaign to isolate Pakistan on the issue of terrorism,” Singh added. He said the issue of terrorism was being discussed on Saturday at the UN General Assembly in New York.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We have to identify and bring concrete proof of the involvement of Pakistan-based establishments in terror activities. Pakistan said it was Jaish-e-Mohammed who had done it (the Uri attack). Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Azhar Masood was set free by the NDA government in the Indian Airlines aircraft hijacking case. The Congress party never compromised with those involved in terrorist activities,” Singh said.
He said the BJP as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his tenure as the Gujarat chief minister, had made “aggressive” statements against former prime minister Manmohan Singh. “But, Modi is doing the same thing as Singh now when he is in power,” Singh claimed."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the public for the first time at Kozhikode in Kerala on Friday since the deadly attack in Uri which killed 18 Indian soldiers. Modi sent a strong message to Pakistan from Kozhikode where the three-day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National Council’s meeting began on Friday.
PM Modi said, “I want to talk to the people of Pakistan from here today”. On Uri attack he said, “Our 18 soldiers had to sacrifice their lives because of terrorists exported by our neighbouring country”.

 
Praising the people of Kerala, PM Modi said, ” When we think of Kerala, we think of God’s Own Country, it has an impression of purity and holiness.” He also assured the party workers in Kerala that their sacrifice and hard work will never go in vain.
Here are some top quotes from his address:https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
# When I visited gulf countries recently, I wanted to meet my people from Kerala living there.
# When we think of Kerala, we think of God’s Own Country, it has an impression of purity and holiness.
# Thinkers like Mahatma Gandhi,Ram Manohar Lohia,Deendayal Upadhyaya have helped shape our country’s politics in the last century.
# Our Govt is focused on upliftment of poor, downtrodden people of our country.
# Jan Sangh and BJP Karyakartas from Kerala have seen and faced so much. Today too, party isn’t in power here but they continue serving.
# I want to assure the party workers in Kerala that their sacrifice and hard work will never go in vain.
# Kerala ke karyartaon ko vishwas dilata hoon ki aapki tapasya, balidaan kabhi bekaar nahi jayga, kabhi na kabhi to rang layga.
# The country is moving forward with the mantra of “Sabka saath sabka vikaas”.
# I can see a lot of potential to make sure that this 21st century becomes Asia’s 21st century.
# There is 1 nation in Asia whose aim is this century does not become Asia’s and is associated with terrorism.
# This one country exports terrorism to other countries.
# Wherever terrorism is happening across Asia, the affected nations are blaming only 1 nation.
# Whenever news about terrorism comes, news also comes either the terrorist came from there or like Osama went there after the act.
# Terrorism is the enemy of humanity. We need to join our hands to defeat terrorism.
# Hindustan na kabhi aatankwaad ke saamne jhuka hai, aur na kabhi jhukega
# Our 18 soldiers had to sacrifice their lives because of terrorists exported by our neighbouring country.
# There’s anger in entire country post Uri attack.18 of our soldiers sacrificed their life after our neighbour exported terrorists there.
# Aatankwaadi kaan kholke sunle, ye desh iss baat ko kabhi bhoolne wala nahin hai.
# I want to talk to the people of Pakistan from here today.
# In the last few months, our neighbour tried to destroy our country by exporting terrorists more than 17 times but our army defeated them.
# Our soldiers have defended the country fighting, protecting the citizens. We are proud of their sacrifices.
# Our soldiers have won the fight against terrorism not with their weapons but with their will power.
# A day will come when people of Pakistan will go against its own Govt to fight terrorism."

Director Aditya Dhar says the intention of his directorial debut Uri: The Surgical Strike is not to show Pakistan in the bad light but to focus on the issue of terrorism.
The film is based on the 2016 Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan as a retaliation for the Uri attack that claimed the lives of 17 army personnel.
“The film is about how Indian Army fought terrorism. Our focus in the film is about how to fight against terrorism. There is nothing anti-Pakistan. We are not fighting against any individual or country, we are fighting against the cross-border terrorism that is happening. We have shown a balanced perspective,” Aditya told PTI.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Despite a ban on Indian films in the neighbouring country, the director says he would have loved to show his movie in Pakistan.
“Any sane or logical person be it Indian or Pakistani will understand that the film is about fighting terrorism.”
Aditya said his debut film “Raabta” was set to feature Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead but Khan had to exit the project after Pakistani artistes were banned from working in India in the aftermath of the Uri attacks.
“I was figuring out how to recast for the film and who to approach. But within 10 days surgical strikes happened.”
The retaliation by the Indian side piqued his interest and Aditya said he started to research about the surgical strikes and its planning process.

He went through news articles, met journalists and retired army officers to research the project but a friend told him someone was already planning a film on the topic.
“I panicked and I started writing the screenplay and in 12 days the first draft was ready. It is a sensitive topic and we had to take permission from the Army. I shared my story with Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADDPI), PR division of army and they loved it.
“They told us 12 producers from Bollywood have approached them to make a film on surgical strikes but they did not have any story.”
The director said he was aware of the responsibility that lies on the makers to represent the Indian Army on screen in the most accurate way.
“We wanted to stay as true as possible. We did not exaggerate anything. We stayed real. After all, army men are normal people. Vicky Kaushal and other actors trained for about six months to understand their daily routine and mannerisms,” he added.
Aditya was convinced Vicky was the only actor who could pull off the role of Major Vihaan Shergill, the officer who leads the surgical strikes in the film.
“At that time he had started shooting for ‘Raazi’ and none of his films like ‘Sanju’, ‘Manmarziyaan’ or ‘Lust Stories’ had released. He has done an incredible job in the film.”
Also starring Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam and Mohit Raina, the film is set to be released on January 11."

The barracks remain charred, and a chain-linked fence separates the road from the surrounding land. The movement of civilian vehicles is strictly monitored, and completely barred at night. One year after 19 soldiers were killed in an early morning attack by Pakistani terrorists at the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri, local residents say their lives have changed, with strict security measures in place.
The roads branching off the main road that passes through the Brigade headquarters to villages in the upper reaches of the tehsil can no longer be used by residents after dusk, and the lawns that hold an Army golf course is separated by a fence. At the end of the course, lie the barracks that were the scene of the attack on September 18 last year.
“The Army holds control over the main road leading to the villages closer to the border and that is shut down at 6 pm,” says Dr Sagar D, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Uri tehsil. The Army declined to respond to a request from The Indian Express seeking comment.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

For nearly six months after the attack, local residents say, the Uri-Santra-Mike road connecting the town to 25 villages that lie beyond was closed and entry restricted. “We had to send a legal notice to the Army to open the road because the lives of people in these areas were severely affected and we had to do something about it,” says Sagar.
According to the SDM, as restrictions increased, the civil administration began negotiations with the Army, so that the lives and livelihood of civilians are not affected. The Army shuts its gates at 6 pm, allowing residents to pass through to villages beyond the cantonment until 8 pm after frisking and identity checks. The gates are opened again at 6 am.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, people carried ration on foot to the upper reaches, hiking several kilometres, and children trekked to schools as the road outside the attack site, passing through the Brigade headquarters, remained shut for months.
According to the SDM, around 30,000 people in these villages are affected by the increased security measures. “We are pursuing the grievances of the locals as well as security concerns with the Army. They have considered many of them, but the matter of closing the highway still remains on the table,” he says.
Local residents say that cases of medical emergencies are let through even after the daily deadline. However, they say, those reaching the town late have to spend the night in Uri before moving on to their villages.
A student in Srinagar, who visits his home in Uri during the weekends, says, “I will not be allowed beyond the first Army gate if I reach after the deadline. If I finish class by 5 pm, and try and reach home travelling 100 km, I still have to stay with relatives in Uri town overnight before I can make it.”
Those who work outside town are the most affected as public transport is timed around the Army’s deadline. Residents say details of all civilian vehicles, and their drivers, have to be recorded in the Army register before they cross the gates every time. Before the attack, they say, only one entry was necessary per day.
Then there’s the constant fear of war. “The paranoia of war breaking out was such that people spoke in terms of shelling beginning within the hour, not the next day or week. Some of us had begun to pack our things in case we would need to evacuate,” says an Uri resident, who lives four km from the cantonment.
J&K Police, meanwhile, have increased their public outreach in the area. “Around 12 militants have been killed in the Uri and Rampur sectors in the last one year. The security and restrictions have increased but along with that, we are increasing confidence-building measures in the area for better coordination with civilians,” says Javed, Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Uri."

Thanking Pakistan for its $500 million pledge to help rebuild Afghanistan, the Afghan President suggested the country instead use the money “for containing extremism, because without peace, any amount of assistance will not meet the needs of our people”. The decidedly undiplomatic tenor of Ghani’s remarks was seconded by his co-chair, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who told the regional leaders gathered in Amritsar that “silence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters”. Prime Minister Modi, for his part, has brushed aside widespread speculation of a meeting with Pakistan’s envoy, Sartaj Aziz. No one can dispute the legitimacy of the sentiments that underpin these actions. The question that needs to be asked, though, is if either government — and others like them, worried by Pakistan’s use of jihadists as proxies for its geopolitical interests — actually has a roadmap to deal with the problem.
Prime Minister Modi’s security advisors have a point when they argue against reflexive calls for dialogue with Pakistan. Talking, after all, is simply a tool; like all tools, it guarantees no particular results. Having said that, though, New Delhi needs to ask itself if disengagement is a useful policy, either. The experience of the weeks since the cross-LoC raids, which followed the Uri attack, ought to have made clear even to dyed-in-the-wool government supporters that Pakistan has not been deterred from backing jihadist operations in Kashmir. The raids did introduce elements of uncertainty into Pakistan’s military calculations — but the uncertainties are not so large as to lead the generals to change their approach. The bottom line is this: India’s actions have simply replaced one equilibrium on the LoC with another, somewhat bloodier one.
Disengagement, just like engagement, will offer no results unless it is part of a creative strategy. New Delhi does have tools at its disposal, which rage should not lead it to throw away. India could, for example, be far more vigorous in its engagement of Pakistan’s civil society, rather than unite the entire country behind the generals through mindless hawkishness. It could do much more to revive its ties with Russia and the central Asian states — important actors in the regional chessboard, but for years now relative backwaters for Indian diplomacy. It could look for new ways to work with China in the shared objective of stability in Afghanistan and West Asia. The point is simple: Anger may be a satisfying emotion, but it is not a strategy."

In an Editorial published on Friday, the New York Times has said the “widening conflict with Pakistan” will spook international investors “Mr Modi has been assiduously wooing”.
Recollecting how India and Pakistan — who are both nuclear powers — have fought two wars over Kashmir, the edit said: “It would be disastrous if the current situation escalated into a full-fledged military confrontation. A retaliatory strike by India against Pakistan risks doing just that.”
It also opined that it was highly irresponsible for “the national general secretary of Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party”, Ram Madhav, to urge “For one tooth, the complete jaw. Days of so-called strategic restraint are over.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

It says Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Uri attack rings hollow as “its military has long supported terrorist groups intent on attacking India”.
The edit calls for a durable political solution which is the only way to bring peace to Kashmir. It concludes by saying that reducing cross-border conflict will depend a lot on if Pakistan can be “persuaded to stop expanding its nuclear arsenal and sponsoring terrorist groups that threaten the region”."

Dear Zindagi may well be an Alia Bhatt film but it also will be a litmus test for Shah Rukh Khan who has had a lean run at the box office. Let’s see how the film stands poised a day before its release.
Screen numbers

Being a solo release at the box office tomorrow, the movie has managed to grab an average of nine to 12 screens per multiplex. While it is not close to the numbers that one normally sees for a SRK film, it should still give the movie a good opening in the weekend.
Star power

The movie is packed with stars. Apart from Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh, there is Kunal Kapoor, Angad Bedi, Aditya Roy Kapoor and others. Also Pakistani actor Ali Zafar is a part of the film and it would be interesting to see how much of his role has been retained in the film in the aftermath of the protests post the Uri attacks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The combination of Alia Bhatt and SRK

Alia and SRK’s pairing have generated much buzz. The fact that they are not romantically paired opposite each other makes it a much more exciting prospect to watch. It remains to be seen if Alia can hold up her own in front of the formidable Khan onscreen.
More from the world of Entertainment:

 
Gauri Shinde

She is one of the most exciting female directors on the block. While her debut English Vinglish was a runaway hit, one will have to wait and watch how well she has treated this movie which is about life among other things. Given her sensibilities for making good and meaningful cinema, one wouldn’t be way off the mark to expect a good cinema.

Just days before, it was a merry-making time for the fans of Fawad Khan. Reports had surfaced that Karan Johar had picked the Pakistani actor instead of his favourite, Shah Rukh Khan, as the first guest on the upcoming season of Koffee With Karan. But all hell broke lose when Fawad and other Pakistani artists found themselves under fire after the Uri attack and MNS asking them to leave India.
WATCH VIDEO: What Fawad Khan Has to Say About India And Its Hospitality Months Back 

Whether or not this can be cited as the reason, but now we hear that Karan has gone back to SRK to open the sixth season of his celebrity chat-show. Shah Rukh will be appearing on the episode with Alia Bhatt to promote their upcoming film Dear Zindagi. Yes, Fawad has been dropped as its first guest!https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Fawad had become the apple of Karan Johar’s eyes ever since his performance in Dharma film, Kapoor & Sons that went on to become one of this year’s biggest hits. So much was Fawad’s ever-increasing fan following that the screen time of his guest appearance in Karan’s upcoming directorial Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was increased and Fawad even found place in the film’s promos and songs.

Next we heard that he has also been signed with Katrina Kaif for Dharma’s next. But, following the recent Uri attack, and MNS on Friday giving a 48-hour warning to all Pakistani artists to leave India, things took a U-turn. MNS went on to directly target Karan and SRK, who have their upcoming projects lined up with Pakistani stars Fawad and Mahira Khan respectively. Even yesterday a MNS leader said, “We dare Karan. Let him take a Pakistani artist, see what we will do then.” This, despite Karan saying that banning the Pakistani actors is no solution to terrorism. Of course, we can guess he just cannot pull out from his films with Fawad due to the amount of money riding on the big actor. But, it looks like behind-the-scenes, the filmmaker wants to keep it safe for sometime and refrain from promoting Fawad in any manner.

The political backlash maybe the point of concern behind the entire change in plan for Koffee With Karan 5, but, some reports also hint at another reason. Apparently, Fawad is expecting his second child next month, and his wife will deliver around the same time when the show goes on air. We are awaiting further confirmation."

Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over ‘failure’ to prevent terrorist attacks, BSP supremo Mayawati today said while he is advising Pakistan to concentrate on welfare of its people, he should also introspect on the working of his government.

“It is good to advice Pakistani counterpart to concentrate on welfare his people. PM should also introspect of working of his government. There is anger among people of the country after the killing of 18 armymen in Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“People expect concrete assurance and effective action from PM to check recurrence of such an incident,” Mayawati told reporters here.
People of the country are ‘upset’ with the BJP government due to terrorist attacks on soldiers and want such incidents to end, Mayawati said and lamented that “PM has failed to give any assurance to people of the country that such acts will not be repeated and our borders are safe, there will be no terrorist inflitration and none of your soldiers will have to sacrifice their lives due to terrorism.”
“This is failure of the Centre to fulfill aspirations of the people,” she added. She said instead of framing any “long term policy” to counter such attacks, Modi government is “misleading” the people and trying to divert attention by advising Pakistan to fight “unemployment, poverty, illiteracy”.
“The PM should also see that his record is bad on the fronts of eradicating poverty, controlling price rise and fighting illiteracy,” she said adding that due to failure of BJP to fulfill its promises it had to taste “humiliating defeats” in Delhi, Bengal, Bihar, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
On Jammu and Kashmir, Mayawati said that the situation there could not be controlled in past three months due to which the “people of the country are concerned”.
Alleging that PM Modi was trying to ’emotionally blackmail’ people ahead of Assembly polls, Mayawati said advising Pakistan was a ‘political conspiracy’ and people of UP and Punjab should be aware of it.
Addressing a rally in Kozhikode yesterday, Modi asked Pakistan’s people to question leaders of their country as to why India exports software and Pakistan exports terrorism despite getting Independence together.
Lashing out at the neighbouring country, the Prime Minister said its leaders used to say that they will fight for 1000 years with India and wondered where they were now.
“I accept this challenge. I want to tell you that India wants to fight with Pakistan. If you have the courage then why not fight to end poverty, unemployment, illiteracy. Let us see which country wins, India or Pakistan,” he said.
Accusing Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh of failing to check spread of Dengue and Chikangunia, Mayawati said common man were facing hardships but Samajwadi party is busy in ‘Grihyuddh’ (family dispute)”."

As many as 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in a major terror attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammad in south Kashmir’s Awantipora area Thursday. The suicide bomber, who was identified as a local militant, rammed an explosive-laden car into the CRPF bus which was going from Jammu to Srinagar. Security personnel are probing the incident. Home Minister Rajnath Singh will visit the site tomorrow.
Here’s a timeline of 10 major terror attacks which took place in Jammu and Kashmir:
February 2018: Six Army personnel and one civilian was killed after a group of suspected JeM terrorists had sneaked into the Sunjwan military station in February last year. Intelligence inputs had warned an attack on the army or security establishment by the terror outfit in view of the death anniversary of Afzal Guru who was hanged on February 9, 2013.
December 2017-January 2018: Five CRPF personnel were killed and three others were injured in a 24-hour long encounter between the Border Security Forces (BSF) and suspected JeM militants in South Kashmir’s Lethapora. Three militants were also neutralised during the gun battle.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
December 2017: Five soldiers and two gunmen were killed when militants stormed a CPRF camp in a pre-dawn strike in South Kashmir. The attack was claimed by JeM, whose top leader was gunned down in the district days during the same month.
July 2017: Eight Amarnath pilgrims were killed and 15 were injured when militants attacked a bus carrying at least 56 passengers at Botengo village near Anantnag, on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway, in south Kashmir. Abu Ismail, the operational commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the Kashmir Valley and the mastermind of the attack, was gunned down by security forces at Aribagh Nowgam on the outskirts of Srinagar later in September.
November 2016: A terror strike at an Army base in Nagrota, near Jammu, claimed the lives of seven security personnel. Three terrorists were also killed in the same attack, the biggest terror strike since the September 18 Uri attack.
September 2016: Twenty soldiers were killed in a militant attack in Uri area of Baramulla district. Fidayeen militants stormed an Army camp in Uri near the Line of Control (LoC) in the wee hours of the day. Four militants were killed in the encounter.
June 2016: Eight CRPF personnel were killed and 20 others were injured after militants attacked their convoy at Frestbal near Pampore in Srinagar on Srinagar-Jammu National Highway.
January 2016: A group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot seven security personnel were killed along with six attackers.
December 2015: Six CRPF personnel were injured when militants opened fire on their convoy near Green Tunnel at Samthan in Bijbehara in south Kashmir’s Anantnag District.
November 2015: Three JeM militants and a generator operator of MES was killed when a group of militants attacked an Army camp near LoC at Tanghdar in North Kashmir’s Kupwara District.
March 2015: A fidayeen squad of militants in Army fatigues stormed a police station in Kathua district killing seven persons, including three SF personnel, two civilians and two militants. Twelve persons, including eight CRPF personnel, three cops and a civilian were also injured in the incident."

Responding to The Indian Express report ‘Terrorists locked soldiers in cook house, store: Probe’, Alok Mittal, Inspector General and Official Spokesperson of the National Investigation Agency, has said the investigation into the attack on the Army camp in Uri is “only at a preliminary stage” and “conclusions attributed to the NIA investigation are false and misleading, and not supported by any investigational findings”.
“The movements of the terrorists inside the Army camp are still being verified and at this stage, it cannot be said to be the same as published in the newspaper. No seizure of any items including Kalashnikov rifles have been made by the NIA so far, and hence the presence or absence of markings on them have not been ascertained yet. Further, the process of taking over of the case properties are only underway, and have not been completed. The reference to the NIA’s conclusions on the GPS sets, and other case properties in this news report, are thus without basis,” Mittal said. He said the DG, NIA, has not yet visited the attack site at Uri, as was reported.
Referring to the same report, Colonel Abhijit Mitra, Director (Media), Integrated HQ of MoD (Army), said the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) had not claimed that weapons carried by the terrorists had Pakistani markings. He also said “the NIA does not have the mandate to investigate plans and conduct of Indian Army’s counter-terrorist operations. Its mandate, if any, under such circumstances, is to collect, collate and analyse forensic evidence to determine identity of terrorists, collaborators and sponsors, as applicable”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Indian Express replies:
The DGMO’s formal statement on the Uri attack made no reference to markings being found on the weapons carried by the terrorists. However, at least nine national television, print and news agencies including Doordarshan, reported the DGMO as saying that the weapons bore Pakistani markings. These reports were never denied until The Indian Express reported it.
Though it calls the report “false and misleading”, the NIA has not denied any of the three statements of fact. Like the Army, the NIA has not denied that no Pakistani markings have been found on the four weapons seized from the Uri attackers. It has said “the process of taking over of the case properties are only underway, and have not been completed”.
The NIA does not deny that a number of Army personnel died of asphyxiation in buildings bolted from the outside. The NIA denies it has possession of a GPS set found at the site. The report, however, stated that the GPS set was with the NTRO, a different organisation.
The report erroneously stated that the Director General of NIA, Sharad Kumar, had visited Uri. The error is regretted."

(File photo)
State president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dilip Ghosh, on Tuesday defended party national president Amit Shah who recently stirred a controversy stating that “over 250 terrorists” were killed in the air strike by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in Balakot, Pakistan, on February 26.
On Sunday, Shah claimed that “more than 250 terrorists were killed in the IAF attack on Jaish-e-Mohammed training camps”, triggering a row with opposition leaders, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, asking for data on the toll. On Monday, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said that the IAF was not in a position to confirm the number of deaths.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Dilip Ghosh cited a report by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), which said that about “300 mobile phones with active signal strength were there in the facility”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“An NTRO report stated that there were 300 active mobile phones in the area. Given those figures, it is very much possible that over 250 terrorists were present in that area,” Ghosh said. Coming down heavily on political leaders who questioned the air strike, Ghosh said, “We don’t need Imran Khan. Mamata Banerjee is enough to defame India. How did she get the figures when she claimed hundreds of people were killed during Nandigram violence? As long as the TMC is here, there is no need for terror groups such as Simi and Al-Qaeda to attack India.”
“People shouldn’t allow such cheap politics at the cost of country’s respect. Leaders who do this will face the wrath of the people during the Lok Sabha elections,” Ghosh added.

The designation of Masood Azhar, the leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the group behind most of the recent big attacks in India from Pathankot to Uri and the February 14 bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 CRPF jawans, is a diplomatic victory for India. Efforts to have him listed by the UN Security Council ISIL (Da’esh) and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee set up under resolution 1267 began 10 years ago after the Mumbai attacks, at the same time Hafiz Saeed and other members of Lashkar e Toiba were included in the list. India later made attempts to tag him in 2016 after the Pathankot attack, and in 2017, months after the Uri attack. Though JeM itself had been designated as early as 2001, Azhar managed to escape the global terrorist tag mainly due to China’s “technical hold” against such listing, including earlier this year, when France moved a resolution in early March, with the US and UK as co-sponsors, after the Pulwama attack. But with several shifts in world politics, and despite its own determination to stand by Pakistan in this matter, Beijing had clearly begun to realise the diminishing returns of shielding Azhar, especially as he was fast becoming known as “China’s favourite terrorist”. After the failure of the France-UK-US proposal, the US took the lead in forcing Beijing’s hand with a resolution in the Security Council. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed Azhar’s designation “a victory for American diplomacy and the international community against terrorism, and an important step towards peace in South Asia”.
For India, the inclusion of Azhar in the UNSC 1267 list by itself does not bring closure on a chapter that began in 1994 with Azhar’s arrest in Kashmir, the hijack of IC 814 to Kandahar, his release in exchange for the passengers, and his setting up a terrorist shop in Pakistan, which then went on to plan and carry out the 2001 attack on Parliament. Pakistan has to take the next steps required under UNSC 1267, which means it must freeze Azhar’s assets, impose a travel ban on him, and put in place an arms embargo against him. Such measures have not proved to hinder Hafiz Saeed, founder leader of LeT/Jamat ud dawa. Despite being listed as a global terrorist organisation, the JeM has flourished. Only when the Pakistan security establishment takes steps to shut down the group, in a manner that will convince the world, will this chapter come to an end.
The designation is another reiteration that Pakistan houses many of the listed global terrorists in the world. But Islamabad’s search for a face-saver in the omission of “political references” to the Pulwama attack and “maligning the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris” in the reasoning for the designation shows that the road ahead is long when it comes to convincing Pakistan that terrorist groups cannot be used as instruments of state policy."

Spider-Man: Homecoming trailer has got everyone excited. In fact, recently Shah Rukh Khan shared a cute picture of AbRam, who is reportedly a huge fan of the superhero. But he isn’t the only one. Following SRK, Pakistani actor Mahira Khan also shared a picture with her son, and seeing the two, we know that even they are equally excited about Spider-Man’s upcoming film. Well, cuteness has just crossed all limits with both of these pictures. Now, we leave it to you to decide which Spidey looks better – AbRam or Azlaan.
In AbRam’s picture, we saw the little one dressed as the superhero. SRK wrote, “Spidey boom at home. They r coming out of everywhere!” Mahira recently made her Bollywood debut with Shah Rukh Khan and she seems to be inspired from the Bollywood superstar in many ways, especially about conducting herself on social media. The actor has been very active in responding to her fans in India.

During Raees days, she expressed her grief on not being able to promote the film in India due to the ban on Pakistani actors post the Uri attack. However, her dream came true when in Mumbai, Shah Rukh introduced the media to Mahira through a video call. Raees, which released in January went on to become the biggest hit at the box office in the first quarter of this year. However, Mahira fans in India are yet unclear whether they will ever be able to see the beautiful actor back on the Bollywood screen, with any Indian actor.

SHORTLY AFTER chairing an all-party meeting during which political leaders were briefed about the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army on terrorist launch pads in PoK, Home Minister Rajnath Singh once again tweeted about “surgical precision” — this time in the context of a hockey match between India and Pakistan. In a tongue-in-cheek tweet, Singh said, “India’s U-18 hockey team registers victory in Asia Cup semi-final with surgical precision. Congratulations to the boys on making India proud.”

SEVERAL GOVERNMENT engagements were cancelled or rescheduled in view of the “surgical strikes” carried out by the Indian Army. A crucial meeting to review the Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan, which was to be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday morning, was postponed. The rural development ministry, which had planned a media tour to Porbandar, sent out a message to journalists saying, “due to Indo-Pak situation, the media tour to Porbandar stands cancelled, will plan next very soon”. On Wednesday night, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikkar and NSA Ajit Doval did not turn up for a dinner with Coast Guard commanders at the Coast Guard Headquarters.
Action, Reaction
EVER SINCE the Uri attack, the Congress has been targeting the Centre. But on Thursday, after the announcement of the “surgical strikes”, the party told its spokespersons not to issue any immediate reactions. After Congress chief Sonia Gandhi met some top leaders, the party issued a statement backing the government action and congratulating the Army. With the name of a senior BJP leader cropping up in the suicide of B K Bansal, former Ministry of Corporate Affairs director general, the Congress was planning to rake up the issue on Thursday. But the plan was aborted after the government’s announcement.

New Judges
RELATIONS BETWEEN the government and the judiciary seem to be showing signs of a thaw. After clearing a handful of appointments and three transfers of high court judges, the government on Thursday issued warrants of appointment of 15 judges to the Madras High Court and five additional judges to the Kerala High Court. More appointments are going to be cleared in the next few days."

(Source: Express Photo/Shuaib Masoodi)
Jammu and Kashmir Police on Sunday claimed to have foiled a major terror attack plan with the killing of three militants close to the Line of Control (LoC) in Uri. The police said the militants were planning a fidayeen attack, similar to last year’s attack on the Army’s Brigade headquarters in Uri town.
One soldier and four civilians were wounded in the gunfight that lasted several hours at Kalghi village on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway, about seven kilometres from the Brigade headquarters in Uri. “We have averted a major tragedy today after zeroing in on the militants in Uri,” Director General of Police S P Vaid told reporters in Srinagar. “They (the militants) were planning an attack on the lines of the one on at the Army base last year.”
On September 18 last year, militants stormed the Brigade headquarters in Uri after cutting the fence and killed 19 soldiers in one of the worst militant attacks in valley. Several barracks of the fortified camp were also burnt to ashes in the attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Sunday morning, the police received specific inputs about the presence of three militants at Kalghi village. As a joint team of police and Army cordoned off the village and zeroed in on the target houses, the militants opened indiscriminate fire. The forces retaliated, resulting in a gunfight that lasted several hours. The encounter ended with killing of all the three militants hiding in the village.
While Uri is one of the preferred and short infiltration routes for the militants, there have been very few encounters between militants and security forces in the region in the recent years. Though the police did not reveal the identity of the killed militants and their affiliation, they said they were foreign nationals.
“All three Pakistani fidayeen terrorists killed in Uri encounter,” said police spokesperson SP Manoj Kumar. “A major terrorist attack was averted.” The Army, however, played down the incident, saying that an infiltration bid by the militants was foiled. “Infiltration bid foiled in Uri sector. Two armed intruders killed. Ops in progress,” tweeted the Army’s Northern Command."

The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) on Friday called off its ‘Aalishan Pakistan’ exhibition which was scheduled to be held in India, citing tense relations with New Delhi. The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) in a statement said the fair aimed at showcasing Pakistani goods in India in September/October has been cancelled.

“Due to current situation between Pakistan and India which is beyond TDAP’s control, the event planned for 2016 has been called off,” Dawn quoted the statement as saying.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The statement added that the TDAP held the first edition of the event in 2012 and second in 2014.
Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi have soured following Sunday’s militant attack on an army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of eighteen soldiers.
The armed militants lobbed grenades into their tents and barracks, while the soldiers were sleeping. The ensuing fire led to a large number of casualties. Twenty-eight injured soldiers are being treated at a military hospital."

Shiv Sena today warned the BJP-led central government that it would have to face the anger of the people if it did not take urgent steps against Pakistan for stopping terror attacks. “We don’t believe that it (today’s attack on Army’s battalion headquarters in Uri, north Kashmir) is a terrorist attack. It was a planned attack by Pakistan,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters in Mumbai.
“There is no need to talk now. It is time for urgent and rigid action against Pakistan. If these attacks do not stop now, people will turn against the government,” Raut, a Rajya Sabha member, said. Heavily armed militants, suspected to belong to the terror group JeM, stormed battalion headquarters of the Army in Uri town in the wee hours today.

Seventeen jawans were killed in the attack and 19 others sustained injuries. Four militants involved in the strike were killed by the Army. Shiv Sena is a partner in the BJP-led governments both in Maharashtra and at the Centre."

While there was a hue and cry regarding Pakistani actors like Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan working in India post the Uri attack, not many know that the protests also affected popular TV series, The Kapil Sharma Show.
Actor Upasana Singh, who is loved as Bua on the show, has not shot for a single episode from past two months and that’s because the actor who plays her husband on the series is Pakistani comedian Naseem Vicky.

 
Upasana’s absence from The Kapil Sharma Show set the gossip mills abuzz with the rumours that she had quit the show but the actor revealed that the channel doesn’t know how to use her track now that Naseem is not in India. “I haven’t left the show. I am very much part of it. But right now the channel doesn’t know how to use my track in the show because the actor who played my husband, Naseem Vicky, is from Pakistan and as Pakistani actors can’t work here so he left for his country long back. It is true that I have not shot for the show from past two months but I will be back whenever the channel calls me. I have great relations with the channel,” Upasna told indianexpress.com.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, Upasana’s co-star Kiku Sharda had spoken to us about her absence from the show. “As a co-actor I can say that she hasn’t shot with us from past two months. We haven’t seen her on the set. Generally the channel and the production house take the call who will shoot for which episode so, I don’t know what actually transpired but she hasn’t been part of the show,” Kiku said.
Upasana entered The Kapil Sharma show in July after quitting Krushna Abhishek’s show Comedy Nights Live. Upasana’s character Bua was one of the highlights of Comedy Nights with Kapil while the show aired on Colors. After Kapil and the channel had a fallout, he decided to start his show on Sony, and while other cast members of CWNK like Kiku, Sunil Grover and Sumona Chakravarti joined him in his new venture, Upasna decided to star in its replacement, Comedy Nights Live.

She, however, didn’t enjoy her time on the show and quit it to join Kapil’s team."

MIDWAY THROUGH HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar’s briefing on the BJP National Executive meeting, the microphone stopped working. For a few uncomfortable moments, Javadekar and BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma were left tapping their microphones. The problem was apparently a power cut at the venue, in Lutyens’ Delhi. When the microphones finally started working again, a smiling Javadekar quipped, “All is well” — a line immortalised by Aamir Khan in Three Idiots.
Final Farewell
VETERAN ACTOR Om Puri’s death was mourned by many — in India as well as Pakistan. Pakistan envoy Abdul Basit tweeted a photograph of his last meeting with Om Puri in August last year, and described him as “down to earth” and a “great actor”. A known proponent of peace between India and Pakistan, the actor had denounced the ban on Pakistani artistes after the Uri attack.
Retirement Benefithttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
DINESHWAR SHARMA, who recently retired as Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief, may be in the reckoning for the post of Governor. A Kerala-cadre IPS officer, Sharma completed his term last month and declined an extension offer. There is speculation that he may be given one of the several vacant posts of Governor, either in the North East or closer to Delhi. In the past too, many former IB chiefs have been sent to Raj Bhavans.
Factional Feud
NOWADAYS, IT seems Congress events in Haryana are incomplete without a street fight between supporters of Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Tanwar. The Congress protest against the Centre’s demonetisation decision turned ugly on Friday in Bhiwani, Fatehabad and Gurgaon as partymen indulged in fistfights. The clashes came days after Sushil Kumar Shinde — who was asked by the party to look into the assault on state Congress president Tanwar, allegedly by Hooda supporters at a party event in Delhi — submitted his report to the high command."

A day after the Modi government abolished Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and downgraded the state to two Union Territories, Pakistan’s National Security Committee (NSC) has taken the decision to downgrade diplomatic ties with New Delhi, among other steps to protest India’s actions in Kashmir.
“Our ambassadors will no longer be in New Delhi and their counterparts here will also be sent back,” Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was quoted as telling ARY television, by Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper.
According to PTI, Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan Ajay Bisaria has been expelled and Pakistan will not send its High Commissioner-designate to New Delhi. However, The Indian Express has learnt that Bisaria has not yet been formally asked to leave. Read this in Banglahttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This is not the first time that India and Pakistan are downgrading ties. In 2001, India pulled out Vijay Nambiar, it’s high commissioner to Islamabad after the JeM attack on Parliament. Pakistan reciprocated by pulling out its high commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi.

The two Deputy high commissioners held the fort for more than a year in the respective capitals.
In 2003, India expelled Jalil Abbas Jillani, Deputy high commissioner and Pakistan’s acting high commissioner, from New Delhi, accusing him of espionage. Pakistan retaliated by sending back the Indian acting high commissioner Sudhir Vyas.
Full diplomatic relations resumed later in 2003 when Pakistan appointed Aziz Ahmed Khan to Delhi as high commissioner and India sent Shiv Shankar Menon to Islamabad.
Both India and Pakistan also decided to downgrade the strength of their respective missions to 51, half of the full strength. There were other actions at the time as well. India had suspended air, train and bus links to Pakistan.
This time, it is Pakistan that has announced its decision to recall its envoy and expel the Indian High Commissioner. Pakistan has also announced other decisions taken at Wednesday’s National Security Council meeting.
As reported by Pakistan newspaper Dawn, these are the suspension of bilateral trade, review of bilateral arrangement, taking India’s actions in Kashmir to the United Nations, and observing August 14 in solidarity with Kashmiris.
The India-Pakistan official bilateral trade is worth about $2 billion. According to a recent report by ICRIER, it peaked to about $ 2.5 billion, but fell again after the Uri attack, recovering a little to slump again due to the 200 per cent duty imposed on imports from Pakistan after the Pulwama attack.
India’s top exports to Pakistan are chemicals and textiles, accounting for almost 70 per cent of the bilateral trade. Pakistan’s top exports to India are vegetable fats and oils, and minerals, accounting for about 70 per cent of its trade with India."

After the glory of winning the Asian Champions Trophy, PR Sreejesh seems to have had the same unpleasant experience that anyone using air travel can be victim to. India’s star custodian uploaded an image on his twitter handle showing a receipt from airline career Air Asia which showed that he was penalised Rs 1500 for excess baggage.
The ‘excess baggage’ was his sports equipment. “Extra charges for the sports equipment bag which come below 15 kg?? Are they expecting me to carry make up kit ??.. funny concept @Air Asia,” Sreejesh tweeted with the screenshot of the penalty receipt.
Being the goalkeeper, Sreejesh’s equipment is expected to be heavier than that of any of his teammates as it includes heavy protective gears like upper body protection, thick pads, gloves and a helmet. On the other hand, outfield players only need to carry their hockey sticks and shin guards.
Sreejesh could not play in the Asian Champions Trophy final against Pakistan in Malaysia but played a vital role in the semi finals against South Korea. The match was tied 2-2 after the two halves and had gone to a penalty shootout. Sreejesh saved the deciding penalty stroke that helped India defeat Korea and set a date with arch rivals Pakistan in the finals.

Despite his absence, India were able to defeat Pakistan through regular play 3-2. Sreejesh has earned praise for his work as India’s chief custodian and is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the game. Sreejesh said that he dedicated India’s victory to the families of soldiers martyred in the Uri attacks."

Criticising Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s silence over the recent surgical strike on terror camps in the LoC, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday pointed out that while all other parties have congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Army, Mamata has kept quiet on the issue.

“It shows that the chief minister is not happy over the attack on Pakistan terror camps. The CM will have to break her silence and clear the state’s stand on the issue. The way Bengal has become a safe haven for terrorists, it shows how weak the Bengal government is when it comes to taking steps against these terror outfits,” Ghosh told mediapersons after the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the party’s extended state committee.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The nation wants to know whether they (the TMC) are on the side of India or Pakistan. Whether they love the country or they are against it,” he added.
Earlier, the BJP had questioned the Trinamool government’s decision of giving “just Rs 2 lakh” to the soldiers from West Bengal killed in the Uri attack, while other states had announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation. “The party decided to launch a ‘Save Democracy Movement’ from November 30 to December 14 against Trinamool Congress’ attempt to make the state Opposition-free by using unfair, undemocratic and unconstitutional strategies,” he said. The party, meanwhile, has decided to complete meetings of the new committees of all its 1,000 mandals by November 15, Ghosh said.
Speaking after the meeting, party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that if need be, Ghosh would continue as the state party president for another term.

“On and off we get to hear all sorts of news in the media centered around the presidentship of Ghosh. If required, Ghosh will serve as the state party president for the next term as well,” Vijayvargiya said.
Claiming that several CPM leaders had visited him in Delhi in the recent past and expressed interest in joining BJP, Vijayvargiya said: “Soon you will see many CPM leaders close to former CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee defecting to BJP.”
“They know that BJP is the only alternative in Bengal, which can give any resistance to the autocracy of TMC,” he added.

Vijayvargiya said strengthening the party organisation and bringing in new faces, especially from the younger generation, would be stressed upon.

Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who was in the city, joined the meeting later and lauded PM Narendra Modi’s retaliation to the Uri attack."

Since the Uri attack, the security forces say they have foiled several infiltration attempts across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. At least one “catch” is cooling its heels in Bamial police custody in Pathankot, Punjab — a pigeon, with “suspected Pakistani links”.
There is no way to know if the bird flew in from across the border. It was an “alert” villager called Satinder who brought it in on October 1, after noticing a message in Urdu tied to its legs. The BSF decided not to take a chance after reading the message — ‘Modi Ji we are not the same as were in 71 — Jaish-e-Mohammad’ — and handed it to the police.
“We have mentioned in the daily duty register that this pigeon was caught by the BSF and a message in Urdu was found attached to its feet,” says Inspector Dalip Kumar, assigned to look after the bird at the Bamian police outpost.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In the absence of instructions from above, including the government, the police officers have bought a “special cage” worth Rs 300 to keep the bird. The pigeon is being fed bajra and water, informs Kumar, adding that while similar “suspicious” birds have been held near the border earlier, it is their first such case.

Says Kuldeep Singh, DSP Pathankot (Rural), “We will see what can be done next for this pigeon. The media has gone crazy asking questions about this catch. We are troubled by some self-styled reports on the bird saying it would be freed… So far we have no plans to release the pigeon.”
On Friday, Inspector Kumar carried the pigeon on a bus to the Animal Husbandry Hospital in Gurdaspur, 35 km away, for scanning — the nearest place with the facility. “We wanted to scan him to know if someone had hidden a SIM card or other material inside him,” says Kumar. “Everyone in the bus was interested in him. The pigeon has become famous.”
However, the inspector had to return disappointed as the scanning machine was not working.

An inspector with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Amritsar, Ashok Joshi, says it is not that easy to get pigeons to carry messages. “You have to travel yourself with the pigeon to the place where you want him to carry the message. Once a pigeon is trained, it can guide other pigeons to a specific place. But due to the complexity of the Indo-Pak border, it is quite difficult to train a pigeon to go across the border to a specific place. It is possible that none of the pigeons caught on the border is trained.”
Moreover, Joshi adds, pigeons can “get confused about the path if caught in bad weather or if they go too far from their area”. Explaining how it may have got caught, he adds, “If a pigeon is too tired after a long flight, it would not fly away when a human comes near.”
Kumar is prepared for the long haul. “We have to take care of this pigeon till the investigations are over,” says the Inspector.
However, should the pigeon be “found guilty of carrying the message from Pakistan”, he admits, he has no idea what would happen to it."

BJP president Amit Shah Sunday warned that Pakistan and the terrorists it backs should not consider Uri as a closed chapter because “it is a long war and the fight is on.”
“Uri is a temporary statement and the final victory will be our Army’s,” Shah said.
He also clarified that the government was ready to talk to anyone who believes in the Indian Constitution. “I want to reiterate the pledge that Kashmir is an integral part of India and no one can take it away from us. The government is ready to talk to anyone. But (only) with those who consider themselves Indian and believe in the Indian Constitution,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

A day after PM Narendra Modi said that sacrifices of Indian jawans in Uri will not be forgotten, the BJP’s National Council meeting endorsed a statement that tried to address party cadres agitated over the Uri attack.
The statement, read out by Shah and endorsed by the National Council without any deliberation, echoed the PM’s line and said the party would extend all support to the government in its war against terrorism. “BJP feels the widespread anger in the people against the conspirators behind the Uri attack. BJP and the central government have adopted the policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism from the beginning. A strong reply to defeat such terror attempts will be given,” the statement said.
The statement added that 117 terrorists have been gunned down in the past eight months. “Terrorists have made 17 attempts to infiltrate… but our brave soldiers have foiled them. The Uri attack has been carried out due to this frustration…This is a long war which has been forced on us by our neighbour. The battle may be a protracted one, but we shall fight to the finish. We are confident that our Army will have the final victory,” it said.
The statement urged all political parties to stand together with the government in the war against terrorism.
It also said that Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s speech at the UN General Assembly had “exposed” Pakistan’s open support to terrorists."

Myanmar’s State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi, landed in Goa on Sunday ahead of the BRICS-Bimstec Outreach Summit and a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After her party National League of Democracy swept the parliamentary elections and was installed in office earlier this year, this is the Nobel laureate’s first visit to India.

Suu Kyi is scheduled to attend a ceremonial lunch hosted by Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar for all participants of Bimstec, after which she will attend the BRICS and Bimstec Outreach Summit later in the evening, with other leaders of the two groupings. As host of this year’s BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Summit, India, as is the practice, can invite neighbouring countries to join in for an outreach summit.
Following last month’s cross-border terror attack on an Indian Army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 19 Indian soldiers, India chose to invite countries belonging to the Bimstec grouping over those of Saarc. Countries belonging to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) are India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
WATCH VIDEO | 

 
New Delhi blamed Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed for the September 18 Uri attack and launched a diplomatic blitz to isolate Islamabad in the international community. The invitation to Bimstec countries instead of the Saarc countries is being seen as another step in this direction. Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Maldives are the members of the South Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) that are also not members of Bimstec."

Many congratulatory and celebratory messages were posted, directed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is being lauded to have taken a courageous step.

But the singer’s tweet was met with a huge backlash afterwards. Adnan Sami submitted a request for Indian citizenship in May, 2015 after his Pakistani passport expired and was not renewed by the government there. People have criticised Sami for siding with India, in spite of being the “son of a PAF pilot”.
Sami, however, chose to give a fitting reply to these people on the Internet. He said: “Pakistanis r outraged by my earlier tweet. Their outburst clearly means they see Terrorist & Pakistan as the same!”
With this, Adnan became one of the many soft targets of the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan. Twitter has been abuzz with hate for Sami, who was merely expressing his opinion.
With this, Adnan becomes one of the many soft targets of the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan. While MNS workers and supporters have declared that they will boycott artists from Pakistan like Fawad Khan, Ali Fazal, Mahira Khan etc. Sami is being spewed venom at, because he supported India’s stand.
Here is Sami’s tweet that set Twitter users off.
 

Here are some of the reactions the tweet generated.
 



This was the singer’s retort to the hate.
 

His reply also constituted a very sharp observation, which if thought about, applied to many extremists in both countries."

The Bollywood industry had become the battleground where some actors chose to agree to the banning of Pakistani actors while others either opposed it or chose to stay neutral.
The Film and Television Producers Guild of India had promised to bar Pakistani actors and the entertainment industry in Pakistan too had suspended the screenings of Indian films until all was well at the borders. According to a report in DNA, Pakistani enchantress, Saba Qamar, who made her debut in Bollywood opposite Irrfan Khan in Hindi Medium will probably break the tension that had developed months ago. She may cross the borders to promote the film.
“I don’t know the details. The producer will know better. But something is being planned,” Irrfan Khan had told the media. The relation between Pakistan and India has not improved yet but it looks like Saba is ready to bring back cultural communication between the two countries. “Saba is keen to come to India, and she isn’t nervous or anxious about how she will be received in India. It all depends on whether she’s granted a visa or not,” said a source close her.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“There was never any official ban on the entry of Pakistani artistes in the country. Only self-appointed vigilante groups were vocal about the so-called ban. There was never any official ban,” said a government official."

Adnan Sami, who recently received his Indian nationality, has been making news for his pro-Indian statements on different occasions. Now, the singer is trending for his statement which hints at the Pakistani actors who chose to remain silent instead of condemning the attack of Uri. “If your host has extended you a warm welcome, and suddenly a fire breaks out in (his) house, do you just run away? I feel they should have condemned the attack,” Adnan said at an event pointing out that he too had condemned the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai.
The musician equated the Army’s surgical strike across the LoC to an individual having to enter his/her neighbour’s house and clean out their garbage because the neighbour refused to. Taking a strong stand on his statement, Adnan said it is important to understand that the strike took place to eliminate terror camps, irrespective of which side of the border it is and even said that Pakistan should thank India and Indian army for a brilliant, successful, strategic and mature strike against terrorism in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.

The singer, who became the most talked about personality over Twitter for his congratulatory tweet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the surgical attack, was trolled by Pakistani citizens, who even went on to label him as “traitor”. On the very day of the announcement of the surgical attacks on the terrorist launch-pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), Adnan wrote on Twitter, “Big Congratulations to @PMOIndia & our brave Armed forces for a brilliant, successful & mature strategic strike against #terrorism ! #Salute”

But the singer’s tweet was met with a huge backlash. People have criticised Adnan Sami for siding with India, in spite of being the “son of a PAF pilot”. He, however, chose to give a fitting reply to these people on the Internet. He said: “Pakistanis r outraged by my earlier tweet. Their outburst clearly means they see Terrorist & Pakistan as the same!”

With this, Adnan became one of the many soft targets of the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan. Twitter has been abuzz with hate for Adnan Sami, who was merely expressing his opinion. While MNS workers and supporters have declared that they will boycott artists from Pakistan like Fawad Khan, Ali Fazal, Mahira Khan etc. Adnan is being spewed venom at because he supported India’s stand."

The spokesperson added that the NIA’s probe “revealed that the two suspects had crossed over to the Indian side after altercation with their parents due to pressure of studies”. “Evidence collected in the form of statements, technical analysis of their mobile phones, seized GPS devices and other circumstantial evidence collected by the NIA did not reveal any linkage of the suspects with the Uri attackers,” the spokesperson added.
It was initially suspected that the two youths acted as guides for the Uri attackers. On September 18 last year, four heavily armed militants had stormed the Uri army base camp in Jammu and Kashmir killing 19 soldiers and injuring few others.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The NIA had taken over the investigation in the case from the state Police.
The two youths were arrested by the BSF and the Army in a joint operation at ‘Angoor Post at Gavalata village in Uri when they were trying to infiltrate into India.
They were also brought to the NIA headquarters here for detailed interrogation. The NIA has claimed that terror group Laskar-e-Taiba was behind the Uri terror attack. The spokesperson added that “further investigation is continuing in the case.”"

An Indian Army soldier was killed in Gogaldara in Jammu and Kashmir’s Keran sector when Pakistani troops opened fire at an Army patrol along the Line of Control (LoC) on Wednesday. Sepoy Rajesh Khatri died in a hospital in Srinagar where he was airlifted after sustaining severe injuries in the firing.
Following the unprovoked aggression from the Pakistani Army and ceasefire violation along LoC, necessary response was given by the Indian Army. According to an Army official, “Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC in the early hours today. One soldier was injured in the incident.”
However, police sources told PTI that four jawans were injured as Pakistani troops targeted a foot patrol of the Army at Gogaldara. Sepoy Khatri was airlifted to the Base hospital in critical condition, where he succumbed to his injuries. The unprovoked firing adds to the continuous growing list of heightened ceasefire violations along the Indo-Pak border in the last few months.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The attack comes just 48 hours after the completion of one year of Uri attack where four terrorists had stormed an Army brigade headquarters in Uri killing 17 soldiers. Following Uri attack, Indian Army conducted surgical strikes across the border on terror camps.
Following surgical strikes, there has been a spike in the casualties suffered by the Army in operations against militants and ceasefire violations on the LoC. 38 Army personnel were killed between January and September last year — including 19 who died in the Uri attack, which led to the surgical strikes. Since the surgical strikes, the Army toll has gone up to 69 — 25 between October and December last year, and the rest this year.

While Indian Army lost a soldier in Keran, two Pakistani intruders were shot down along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab by the Border Security Force when they refused to surrender while crossing over to the Indian territory."

Goa Congress on Monday criticised the felicitation planned by state BJP unit for Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in Panaji over the surgical strikes by the Army in PoK, saying the BJP was trying to “sell” the anti-terror operation to extract political gains. “What is needed is motivating our armed forces and if the BJP wants to felicitate, it must be our brave soldiers. It is time we stop politicising the strikes,” Congress Goa spokesman Sunil Kawathankar said.
“If Parrikar accepts the felicitation, he should also take responsibility and step down when attacks like in Baramullah happen,” he said. The Congress leader said his party had appreciated the government’s stand and even praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Parrikar after the surgical strikes.

“But looking at the way the BJP is opening a shop and selling the act (of surgical strike) is disgusting. Why did not the BJP demand Parrikar’s resignation when Uri attack happened after the Pathankot strike? Shouldn’t the Raksha Mantri be held accountable for the lapses?” he questioned.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Sunday, Goa Forward party and ruling ally MGP had also expressed their disapproval with the felicitation function planned in Panaji on Tuesday. Goa Forward party had said the BJP was misusing the bravery of soldiers for political gains. MGP Leader Sudin Dhavalikar had said that Parrikar himself should not be accepting such a felicitation.
India carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK, after 19 soldiers were killed in the Uri attack."

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday took a jibe at the Congress and termed the appointment of Lt General (retired) D S Hooda as the party’s task force head as a “belated and grudging recognition and acceptance” of the September 2016 when Indian troops carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control following the Uri attack.
“I am sure the Head of the Advisory Panel would educate the Party leaders that the surgical strikes were no routine step which had been taken several times in the past, but a significant first for India,” Jaitley wrote on Facebook.
In a post titled ‘What it’s Advisor must tell the Congress party on national security’, the senior BJP leader mocked the grand old party over the “need to be educated on national security”. “The party which has ruled the country for over half a century should need to be educated on national security concerns is somewhat intriguing,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
	
	
		
			
On Thursday, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had met the former Army commander to discuss the formation of the task force and its working with a select group of experts to chalk out effective strategies to guard the border, days after 40 CRPF jawans were killed in a terror attack in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Jaitley also claimed that the entry of an “experienced and distinguished former officer of the Indian Army” will only help give “valuable advice to the grand old party”.
While the minister admitted that the induction of Hooda into the party would help educate its leaders, he, however, highlighted out a few “basic essential” points related to national security.
Urging Congress to refrain from “striking a discordant note,” he said the party must “not give an impression to the world that India is divided on how to fight terrorism”. “Do not trivialise a serious national concern on terrorism as has been done by the Congress Spokespersons in the past two days,” he said.
“Next time if extremists and separatists raise slogans on how to break India (the JNU incident), no one from mainstream parties should pay a supporting visit to them. There is no freedom of speech to advocate a breakup of India,” he added.
Asking the party to not “politicise defence procurement on false and imaginary facts” for political gains, Jaitley said It hurts defence preparedness.”
“Politicians of any shade of opinion should not get into slanging match with any of the services personnel or their Chief. The Chief of a Force can’t be described as a ‘Sadak ka Goonda’,” the Union minister said.
“When our intelligence agencies conduct anti-insurgency operations along with the security forces (e.g. Ishrat Jahan case), do not let lose investigative agencies on the intelligence and security network of India,” he added."

Hours after Sri Lanka became the fifth country in the eight-member grouping to pull out of the SAARC Summit, Pakistan on Friday night postponed the event, which was to be held in Islamabad on November 9-10. Pakistan said the new dates will be announced soon.
India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan pulled out of the summit earlier this week, indirectly blaming Pakistan for creating an environment which is not conducive.

“Pakistan deplores India’s decision to impede the SAARC process by not attending the 19th SAARC Summit at Islamabad on November 9-10, 2016,” the Pakistan foreign ministry said on Friday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Islamabad said the spirit of the SAARC Charter is “violated” when a member state casts the shadow of its bilateral problems on the multilateral forum for regional cooperation. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was looking forward to welcoming the SAARC leaders. All preparations had been made for a “successful” summit, said the statement.
 
It said India’s decision to “derail the summit” effectively “contradicts” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to fight poverty in the region. “India’s decision to abstain from the summit on the basis of unfounded assumptions on the Uri incident is a futile effort to divert attention of the world from the atrocities” in Kashmir, said Pakistan.
“Pakistan attaches great importance to regional cooperation under the umbrella of SAARC…Therefore, Pakistan remains committed to hosting the 19th SAARC Summit at Islamabad at the earliest so that the objectives of regional cooperation under the SAARC umbrella can be pursued more vigorously,” it said.
The Pakistan foreign ministry said the new dates for the summit will be announced soon through Nepal, which is currently the SAARC Chair. “Accordingly, we have conveyed the same to the Prime Minister of Nepal,” it said.
Responding to the development, the Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson, Vikas Swarup, said: “We note Pakistan’s decision to postpone the SAARC Summit. They have been compelled to recognise the regional sentiment against terrorism.”
Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka announced its decision to pull out of the summit. Colombo’s announcement came days before Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is scheduled to visit India (October 4-6). He is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and key political leaders during his visit.
“Sri Lanka regrets that the prevailing environment in the region is not conducive for holding the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad,” the Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement.
The general provisions of the SAARC Charter require that decisions at all levels shall be taken on the basis of unanimity, and this applies to the convening of meetings of heads of state or government of SAARC member states as well, Lanka said.
The statement made no reference to the current tension between India and Pakistan, but it “condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations” — an oblique reference to the Uri attack and its aftermath. It stressed the need to deal with the issue of terrorism in the region in a decisive manner.
“Peace and security are essential elements for the success of meaningful regional cooperation for the benefit of the people of South Asia. As a founding member of SAARC, committed to regional cooperation, Sri Lanka hopes that the steps required to ensuring our region’s peace and security will be taken to create an environment that is conducive for the pursuit of regional cooperation,” the statement added."

Russian President Vladimir Putin took a jab at France today, saying it was “not so involved” in efforts to end the war in Syria amid a spike in tensions between the two countries. The comment comes a week after a heated row broke out over Russia’s use of its UN Security Council veto against a French resolution calling for a halt to the bombing of Aleppo.

“France is not so deeply involved in the settlement of the Syrian conflict,” Putin said at a press conference on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in India.
“We remember when the (French) Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier approached the coast of Syria – and we had seemingly agreed to work jointly – but a few days later it turned away and headed toward the Suez Canal,” Putin said.
“What does that say?” he added.
Watch what esle is making news

Putin said the French authorities had decided that the purpose of his Paris visit – the opening of an Orthodox cultural centre – was no longer “suitable for a joint event” given the circumstances in Syria.
“We have other issues apart from Syria, we could have discussed other issues,” he said.
Earlier in the week Putin had accused France of pushing for a UN proposal on Syria knowing Russia would veto it, saying the move was aimed at “inflaming the situation and fanning hysteria around Russia”.
Putin said today that Russia was “always ready to talk with everyone” on ways to end the five-year conflict, “especially large and great powers like France with all its capabilities”.
A brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo backed by Russian airpower has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence since the conflict erupted in March 2011.
The West has accused Moscow and Damascus of committing potential war crimes in the operations against eastern Aleppo."

(Source: ANI/Twitter)
Seventeen jawans have been killed in the militant attack on the rear office of the infantry battalion of the Indian Army at Uri, Baramulla. Reports suggested that the attack started at 5:15 am on Sunday and after a round of intense firing, four militants were neutralised, said the army spokesperson. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the incident and said that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.
This could well be the highest casualty suffered by the Indian Army in a single militant attack. Combing operations are currently underway in Uri and helicopters have been deployed to search areas close to the site.

In the wake of Uri attack, Home Minister Rajnath Singh postponed his trip to United States and Russia. A high level security meet is scheduled at Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s residence at 12:15 pm. Senior MHA and MoD officials are to attend the meeting. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will visit Uri later today.
According to reports, security has been beefed up in Uri and the vital roads that connect the Northern Kashmir town to the Line of Control. The Army had reportedly sent three choppers from army’s 19 divisional headquarters in Baramulla to Uri. Para Commando troops had also been air-dropped into the area to fortify the response by the defence. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will visit Uri later today."

The Indian Army on Sunday said that the Uri terror attack, which left 17 army jawans dead, was the handiwork of terrorists belonging to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM). The four terrorists were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle, and a combing operation was underway. Among those that were martyred, 15 jawans were from the Bihar regiment while two were from the Dogra regiment. The Army said 13-14 casualties had been due to the tents and temporary shelters that caught fire. Follow LIVE updates on the Uri attack aftermath here
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack in strong words saying those responsible for it would not go unpunished. Home Minister Rajnath Singh held a review meeting on Sunday and will meet with senior officials on Monday as well.
While political leaders across the spectrum slammed Pakistan for “aiding and abetting extremist forces”, Pakistan has denied any involvement in the dastardly attack that has inflicted highest casualty on the Indian Army in a single militant attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
We take a look at how Pakistani media covered the Uri terror attack. Here are some of Pakistan’s top news dailies, covering the story from the neighbour’s angle:
The News International
The News International said that the military camp was attacked by “militants” in Uri. The newspaper included Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s statement on Pakistan along with Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s. The newspaper said that Pakistani security officials were confident that the Uri attack was “Pathankot-like stage drama to trumpet its terrorism mantra against Pakistan…” The story further said that the military brigade headquarter was chosen deliberately because of its Sikh-dominated population which would help in antagonising the Sikh community from supporting the Kashmir struggle. The article, written by an investigative editor Ansar Abbasi, questions the attack despite high security in the army unit.
The Express Tribune

The Express Tribune reported that the Indian officials had jumped the gun in blaming Pakistan for an attack that killed 17 of its jawans. The newspaper also included Pakistan Defence Minister Khawja Asif’s tweet that said: “Don’t rule out inside job to malign Azadi movement by blaming Pakistan.” The lead article also said that the “brazen militant attack near the LoC had triggered a “verbal spat” between New Delhi and Islamabad escalating the tension between the two “bitter and nuclear-armed” neighbours.
Pakistan Observer
 
The Pakistan Observer reported that “four heavily-armed suspected militants” killed 17 soldiers in an army base. Rejecting “baseless allegations” from India, the newspaper quoted Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations saying that “no infiltration is allowed from Pakistani soil because water-tight arrangements were on both sides of the LOC Working boundary all along.” The newspaper also termed Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s statement on Pakistan as an “anti-Pakistan rant” and underlined the fact that Singh’s “vitriol” came ahead of the UN meeting where, according to Pakistani newspapers, India and Pakistan will be locked in a showdown over Kashmir.
Dawn


The front page of the Dawn newspaper too covered the attack  and touted Singh’s attack on Pakistan as a “vitriolic assault.” The lead article also said that “India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming and sending the militants across the LoC to launch attacks on its forces.” The newspaper also dedicated an editorial column to the Uri attack and noted that the “Indian authorities’ accusations against Pakistan has plunged Pak-India relations into a dangerous and unstable new phase.” The editorial also carried out Singh’s referral to Pakistan as “terrorist state.” It also quoted Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson saying, “Pakistan is always blamed for any untoward incident in India.”

The reports are from some of Pakistan’s top read news dailies."

Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan from November 10 to 12, Japan’s ambassador to India, Kenji Hiramatsu, spoke with The Indian Express on a wide range of issues — from nuclear cooperation to terrorism, and Shinkansen to the ease of business rankings. Edited excerpts:
What is the state of play on the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal?
On the civilian nuclear agreement, we are working on it. Discussions are taking place on technical details right now. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, we hope to have good progress.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Have all the issues arising out of India’s non-NPT signatory status been resolved?
We have agreed on the important issues…on lot of issues, we have to be careful about screening and scrubbing. On major issues, I don’t see any major differences.
What is Japan’s position on India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group (NSG)?
We are working together with India to make sure that India becomes a member of NSG. So we are communicating and discussing with India to facilitate this process in order for it to become a member of NSG. We are supporting India’s bid to become a member of NSG. We are an important member. Japan continues to communicate with India to support this process.
But China has been blocking the consensus, along with some other countries. How do you propose the way forward?
How to get a majority support on this..in each international negotiation, important thing is to have a critical mass to get through a certain resolution. India is working very hard with almost all member-countries… that is a way forward. We are having regular contact and discussion with the main players in the NSG in trying to find a way to make sure that India becomes a member of NSG.
India has witnessed series of terrorist attacks this year, from Pathankot to Uri. How does Japan view this development?
Japan condemns very strongly terrorism in all forms and manifestations, and Japan is working internationally to tackle this menace. This year, Japan has the presidency of G-7 countries. It has taken the lead on fight against terrorism. Japan has also been a victim of terrorism…last July, in Dhaka, seven aid workers (were) killed, and in February Japanese journalists (were) killed by ISIS in Syria…. A few years ago, some Japanese engineers were killed in Algeria.
Japan is not immune to terror attacks. We are working with countries like India; Japan is communicating with India for information-sharing…
How does Japan view India’s diplomatic initiative to isolate Pakistan at the global level?
I cannot make any judgment about the effect of India’s diplomacy but what India is doing is raising awareness about terrorist threats and to the importance of working together on terrorism issues. Japan has expressed solidarity to India for efforts in countering terrorism.
How did you see the Pakistan defence minister’s comments threatening use of nuclear weapons, in the wake of the Uri attack, especially since Japan has suffered a nuclear attack?
I don’t know in which circumstance those statements were made. But, Japan, in principle, is against any threat of nuclear weapons. It is the only country to have suffered nuclear disaster…we have very strong views that nuclear weapons should not be used, and any threat in use of nuclear weapons are not justified.
What are your comments about the surgical strikes conducted by India?
These so-called surgical strike was made in response to an incident like Uri. India informed (us after the strikes) that it had information like that..at the same time, India government doesn’t have the intention to escalate unnecessarily, so this is what I understood at that time. We fully understand the background behind these surgical strikes. Indian government has made very considerable efforts to explain the event, I appreciate and understand.
Since Japan is one of the members of the 1267 sanctions committee at the UN, how do you see the listing of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist?
We are not opposing this person’s inclusion in the list. We are member of the committee, (and) we have no objection.
How do you see the ease of business rankings by global agencies keeping India quite low, in the 130s?
The ranking is unfair. (The Narendra) Modi government has brought in GST and the bankruptcy law, these are two major achievements. I hope they will implement successfully…the Indian government is making efforts. Many Japanese companies have India as their favourite destination. It is an emerging big market, but some do have trouble, regarding tax issues and others. There is still room for improvement.
One of the showpiece projects between India and Japan has been the Shinkansen, the high-speed train project. What is the state of play?
On Shinkansen, some road map will be agreed. We are comfortable with the pace of the project, I am happy with the progress (made).
Another project, which has been highlight of the defence cooperation has been the US-2 planes. What is the progress on that?
On US-2, there is commitment by the two leaders. The Indian side understands the importance of search and rescue. We are hopeful of some progress. We have every intention to provide the best possible plane to India.
How has been Japan’s experience with the Japan-plus cell?
Japan plus is a very useful mechanism for future investors, it is accumulating experience and knowledge for future investors. It is very nice…it’s a collective effort. It is playing an important role, matching up future investors with relevant authorities."

While many from the Bollywood fraternity have spoken against the MNS decision to ban all Pakistani actors working in Indian films, director Abhishek Jawkar, who debuted in the industry with a thriller film called Missing On A Weekend, says he was planning to cast Pakistani actress Mawra Hocane for his film Not a Prostitute but now he has dropped the plan. “I will not work with any Pakistani actors in my upcoming film Not a Prostitute or in my future projects also. I was planning to cast Pakistani actress Mawra Hocane as the leading lady of my film Not a Prostitute. But now after the Uri attack and India’s surgical attack reply, I strongly feel I should support my country and the soldiers fighting for our nation,” Jawkar said.
The director, though denied about Mawra being a part of his project, said the name of the leading lady will be announced soon. “Casting a lead lady may take a week more and we’re planning to go on floors in November,” he said. Mawra last acted in the film Sanam Teri Kasam and was famous for the song Tu Kheench Meri Photo. Director/Producer Jawkar next is based on the escort industry. Not a Prostitute to be made under the banner of Red Bulb studios, has also been written by him and is scheduled to release in November 2017.
More from the world of Entertainment:

 
With the MNS decision coming true slowly and steadily, a lot of filmmakers are completely at a soup with their upcoming films starring the targetted Pakistani actors remaining incomplete. While some like Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt have vociferously shared their opinion, other celebs like Kangana Ranaut and Ranbir Kapoor chose to remain neutral. And then we had Salman Khan who supported these actors, stating that “they are artistes, not terrorists”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

He was 63. (File)
My last meeting with my friend Manohar Parrikar was on January 27. He stunned everyone when he travelled from the makeshift medical facility at his residence to join me for the inauguration of the third bridge on the Mandovi river in Goa. Manohar Parrikar told me that he could not miss the historic event, and thanked me for helping Goa achieve speedy and all-round development.
As I sat next to him, I couldn’t but feel emotionally choked. His voice was extremely feeble and he had a feeder tube inserted in one of his nostrils. Yet, his discomfort was not visible. What was visible was the indomitable “josh” to serve the people of Goa till his last breath, as he put it. Three days later, on January 30, Manohar presented the budget in the Goa Assembly in the same condition, addressing the House for nearly two hours. On February 4, he tweeted a brave message to the world: “Human mind can overcome any disease.”
As I think of all the moments I have spent with Manohar Parrikar, I can only say that apart from his impeccable integrity, dedication and hard work, he has also emerged as an iconic inspiration for cancer patients. He has shown the world that a terminal illness cannot drain your commitment to the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ram Madhav writes: Politics in Goa revolved around Manohar Parrikar, irrespective of whether he held office or not
Manohar was my contemporary in public life. My association with him dates back to about 35 years ago. Both of us were inspired by the ideology of the RSS, its discipline and the sense of commitment it invoked in us towards nation-building.
A brilliant student who did BTech from IIT Bombay, he entered Goan politics at the instance of the RSS to stall the growing influence of the regional parties in the state. He made his debut in the state assembly in 1994 from the Panaji constituency on the BJP ticket and went on to leave an indelible mark, not only on state politics but also at the Centre as the country’s defence minister.
Parrikar’s tenure as defence minister was historic in many ways. The One Rank One Pension scheme was implemented, the Rafale deal was finalised and India carried out successful surgical strikes in PoK in response to the Uri attack. However, in his personal life, Manohar remained an epitome of simplicity and frugal living. Till a few years ago, he would sometimes drive a scooter to office even after becoming CM. As the defence minister, he often travelled in the economy class of low cost airlines. His needs were minimal. His focus was always on the larger picture.
Manohar believed in pro-active but clean politics. He was among the most selfless politicians I have known, always ready to do what the party asked him. He truly epitomised our party’s spirit of Nation First, Party Second, Self last. In October 2000, Manohar staged an internal coup against a coalition government led by the Congress in Goa without indulging in any kind of horse trading.
Having been the CM of Goa four times, Parrikar has made a pivotal contribution in expediting infrastructure projects and minimising corruption. When I was the BJP president, I would constantly look up to him for new ideas and initiatives to spruce up our good governance agenda.
Manohar quit as defence minister and returned to Goa as CM in March 2017, when we managed to woo parties such as the Goa Forward Party and MGP to support him to form the government. Since I was the overseeing the elections for my party, I have interesting memories of our working together to outsmart the Congress.
However, since February 2018, Manohar had been fighting an arduous battle with cancer. Pancreatic cancer has a low survival rate but looking at Manohar’s zest and energy through this battle, we were hopeful that he will pull off the biggest coup of his life.
But God had other plans. As I recall my association with Manohar, let me make another important point — in my knowledge never before has a leader from a state as small as Goa enjoyed a pan India acceptance and popularity. The reason is simple: Manohar was your next door CM, the kind of relative or uncle you could identify with or relate to, whether you met him at a government office or the vegetable market.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has aptly described Manohar as the builder of modern Goa. Manohar’s death is a loss for every Goan and every Indian. For me, the loss is deeply personal.

(File)
BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday made a pitch for a second term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that “no other leader in the world has such zero tolerance for terrorism”. He cited the strike by Indian Air Force across the Line of Control (LoC) and the surgical strike after the Uri attack.
Speaking at the launch of Kamal Jyoti campaign of the BJP in Ghazipur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh on Tuesdsay, Shah asked: “Whether Gathbandhan can keep the country secure or Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.
“Narendra Modi had promised to secure the country in 2014. The surgical strike in reply to the Uri attack and Tuesday’s air strike have sent a message that for the security of India, the army of the country and government can go to any extent.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shah posed a question to the crowd, “Desh ki suraksha yeh gadhbandan ke log sunishchit kar sakte hain ya Modi ji sunishchit kar sakte hain? (Who can secure the country, people of alliance or Modi…)?” The crowd chorused in reply, “Modi, Modi.”
Shah then said, Who can give an apt reply to Pakistan, who can finish terrorism, who can work for welfare of poor, who can make India a superpower. If anyone can do all these work, it is only our dear leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”
Shah said after the attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, there was demand from different parts of the country to take action so that one would think 10 times before taking such a step. “On Tuesday morning, the Indian Air Force finished the terrorists in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to ensure that they do not bring any more damage to the country.”
Claiming that no other leader in the world has a zero tolerance policy for terrorism like Modi, Shah said, “Modi ji ki jo majboot icha shakti hai aur atakanwad ke khilaf zero tolerance ki jo bhavna hai who bhavna vishwa mein kisi bhi neta ke paas nahi… (The strong will power of Modi ji and his zero tolerance against terrorism is not present in any other leaders of the world).”Lucknow NewsNames of BSP govt projects being changed due to casteist prejudice: MayawatiGovt working on Ambedkar’s principles to ensure benefits to all without discrimination: Yogi AdityanathKashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi Mosque: Sunni Waqf Board moves HC over survey orderClick here for more

(Express File Photo by Shuaib Masoodi)
As we approach the first anniversary of surgical strikes, it is accepted wisdom that the military operation at targets across the Line of Control (LoC) was an unqualified success. Any operation’s success can be best understood as part of the government’s strategy — a bridge that connects political aims to military means. The political aim of the surgical strikes was to demonstrate to its own people the government’s will to respond boldly to a terror strike which emanated from Pakistan. Even if the official statement only mentioned strikes “along the LoC” and the government did not release any proof of the damage caused, the Indian public has been fully convinced of the strikes.
New Delhi’s strategic aim vis-à-vis Pakistan was to demonstrate that space exists for an Indian military response between a defensive response to a major terror attack and an all-out war between two nuclear-armed neighbours. By injecting an uncertainty in its likely response on the LoC, or crossing it, India wanted to force the Pakistan army to reassess its choices that are based on threats of an escalatory dynamic beyond anyone’s control. Unlike the political aim, this strategic aim has not been fully achieved because Pakistan refused to accept that such a military operation took place inside its territory.
By denying the existence of surgical strikes, the Pakistan army was able to avoid public pressure which would have forced it to retaliate against India. It is for this reason that India was prepared for a retaliatory action from Pakistan after the surgical strikes and would have to be prepared for an escalation in the future as well. Reflecting that apprehension, decision makers in Delhi have signalled that every outrageous terror strike in the future will not necessarily be met with a surgical strike. The strategic dilemma of dealing with a recalcitrant neighbour who promotes terrorism under a nuclear umbrella thus remains largely unresolved.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Beyond teaching Pakistan a lesson, another military aim of the surgical strikes would have been to deter the Pakistan army from sending infiltrators across the LoC, to stop it from fomenting violence in Kashmir, reduce casualties of Indian soldiers and to bring a semblance of peace and calmness to the LoC. As reported by this paper (‘Year after surgical strikes: Surge in death count of both soldiers, militants’, IE, September 19), data shows that none of these aims has been met.
The LoC has been very active, with the Pakistan army increasing its efforts to push militants across. With nearly 450 ceasefire violations on the LoC, the ceasefire agreed upon by the two countries in 2003 no longer exists. The army has lost 69 soldiers in Kashmir after the surgical strikes, compared to 38 in the nine months prior to the surgical strikes. Half of the 38 lives lost were in a single terror attack at Uri last September, which led to the retaliatory surgical strikes. To be fair, the army has also killed more militants since: From 100 before the surgical strikes to 178 in the year after it. Military commanders contend that this success in killing more militants is due to the higher morale after the surgical strikes.
The army feels emboldened with the respect it has earned across the country after the surgical strikes. It is justifiably proud of its professionalism in planning and conducting the operation, without any fatal casualty to the soldiers. The special forces have been a part of planning and conduct of a complex operation across the length of the LoC, at multiple points and staggered over a night.
While there has been a huge curiosity about the number of terrorists and Pakistani soldiers killed in the strikes, the army has been silent about it, putting forth the argument that the special forces operatives had no time to count the bodies. Some accounts place these numbers at 35-40 while others place them at 75-80, but there has been no authoritative proof put out yet. Lt General D.S. Hooda (retd), who led the operation as the Northern Army Commander, put it in context when he told this newspaper that “the crucial part about the operation was not about the number of terrorists killed but the safe return of all our soldiers… hundred terrorists killed and one soldier left behind would have been a failure.”
The surgical strikes were the first time the political leadership owned trans-LoC operations and marked a huge shift in the sanctity of the LoC as a de-facto international boundary. During the 1999 Kargil War, when the LoC had been respected as a not-to-be-crossed red line by the previous NDA government even though the Pakistan army had openly breached it.
This could play a significant role in future Indo-Pak negotiations over Kashmir, where India starts asserting its sovereign claim over the whole of J&K, instead of accepting LoC as a reasonable solution. That is still far in the future but having achieved its political aim, the official Indian establishment has been cautious in its claims about the surgical strikes because it realises the dangers of raising the public expectations about its response to any future Pakistani provocation. Others would also do well to take the cue and temper their celebrations and claims on the first anniversary of surgical strikes."

(Source: PTI)
Amid rising tension between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack, Union minister Mahesh Sharma today extended invitation to tourist from all countries, including those from Pakistan. Speaking on the sidelines of a programme to mark the World Tourism Day on Tuesday, he said India is a diverse country and welcomes tourists from across the globe in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family).
“For tourism, we welcome people from there (Pakistan),” he said when asked about the impact of souring India-Pakistan relations on the tourism sector. On reports of India considering a review of ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status given to Pakistan, he said, the call has to be taken by External Affairs Ministry which “issues advisory from time to time” on such issues.
He was speaking to reporters after presenting various awards, including for a painting competition organised by India Tourism. He said people’s faith and perception about India has improved as is evident among others things in higher Foreign Direct Investment at a time the world struggles with economic sluggishness and witnesses bouts of terrorist activities.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said the country has “proved itself” as “Incredible India” with increasing foreign footfalls at various tourism destinations in the country. Sharma said India will offer tourists a “swachh (clean), and safe tourism experience and welcome them in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'”.

Stressing “tourism is for all”, he said his ministry will make all tourist destinations “divyang-friendly (friendly for differently-abled people)” by introducing facilities like ramps in the coming months. The Minister also flagged off a sightseeing tour for ‘Divyang’ children. Thirty five students from class II-VI of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya School for Divyang Children, Minto Road, New Delhi, are part of this sightseeing tour.
Theme for 2016 World Tourism Day is: ‘Tourism for All!! – Promoting Universal Accessibility’. Tourism Secretary Vinod Zutshi said, “On this year’s World Tourism Day help us spread the word of both importance and immense benefits universal accessibility has and can bring to society at large.” Later in the day, the Minister also flagged off ‘Swachh Paryatan Run’ from Transport Bhawan, where Tourism Ministry is housed, to India Gate."

THE CONGRESS Monday said mere “rhetoric” or stating that those responsible for the Uri attack will not go unpunished, will not help, and exhorted the Narendra Modi government to mount a diplomatic offensive to “isolate” Pakistan and ensure imposition of sanctions against the country.
Stating that a “firm and appropriate” response by security forces is required, the party also attacked Prime Minister Modi and said he owes the country an explanation for the “intelligence failure” that led to Sunday’s attack. The Congress also argued that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar cannot shrug off “responsibility and accountability”.
While arguing that the Congress does not intend to politicise the attack, party leaders at the same time tried to embarrass the Centre by recalling Modi’s past tweets and statements following similar attacks when the Congress-led UPA was in power. “The BJP used to argue during our (UPA government’s) time that 10 heads of Pakistanis should be taken for each Indian soldier killed. (But) 17 soldiers have been killed and they are merely holding meetings,” former Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The toll rose to 18 today, with Army Sepoy K Vikas Janardhan succumbing to injuries. Shinde said the Modi government should “immediately give a strong response”.
Watch What Else Is Making News


Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “It is time India presses for complete isolation of Pakistan (and) comprehensive sanctions against it…until complete dismantling of the terrorist infrastructure supported and sponsored by (Pakistan’s) ISI.”
He argued that the government should have kept senior Opposition leadership informed of the situation and its assessment of building a strong national consensus on India’s response. “It is time the government steps away from rhetoric and takes a measured, firm and appropriate response,” Sharma said. “After Pathankot, there was no room for complacency, so there are serious issues that do arise about intelligence failure…not keeping high alert in the wake of developments in Kashmir Valley over the last two months.”
Sharma said Modi and Parrikar have “much to answer (for)”. He added, “The PM owes an explanation for the intelligence failure and his Defence Minister cannot shrug off his responsibility and accountability.”
Sharma said the Congress will not be prescriptive and argued that it is for the government and the security agencies to ensure there is a firm and appropriate response. “Mere words — that it will not go unpunished — may not help,” he said.
At the AICC briefing, Manish Tewari said: “We want to ask the Prime Minister just two questions: will you assure the country that there would not be another terrorist attack, and do you have a policy towards Pakistan? And if you do, what is that policy.”"

There was none.
Even by the usual standards it was a l-o-n-g communique consisting of 109 paragraphs, each marked not by a number but by a bullet point. I can imagine what would have happened when the deputies gathered to draft the communique. I am reminded of how a camel was created: the Creator appointed a committee to design a horse and when the Creator breathed life into the design, a camel was born!
Communiques are long in the making but have a short life. A communique is only good up to the time of the next communique. The principals (presidents and prime ministers) spend little time on the communique. It is a rare occasion when one country/leader will invest a lot of time, diplomatic effort and personal goodwill in persuading other countries/ leaders to highlight a certain matter in the communique. The Goa summit of BRICS countries promised to be one such rare occasion.
India’s main concern
In the days preceding the summit, India was preoccupied with one subject: Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Ever since the cross-LoC action on September 29, 2016, the government (especially the Defence Minister) and the BJP were determined to extract as much political advantage as possible from an Army operation that was accurately described by the Foreign Secretary as “target-specific, limited-calibre, counter terrorist operation”. They did extract mileage in India and hoped to do the same when India was in a gathering that represented 43 per cent of the world’s population.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister churned out some devastating words and phrases. He said Pakistan “embraces and radiates the darkness of terrorism”. He also said terrorism had become Pakistan’s “favourite child”. In another speech, he said Pakistan is the “mothership of terrorism”.
Expectations from the summit were therefore high. We believed that Pakistan will be isolated, named and shamed, and Pakistan will be banished to join North Korea as an outlaw. We believed that the Jaish-e-Mohammad will be named, deservedly, after the Uri terror attack and the Laskhar-e-Toiba will be named because it was the perpetrator of the Mumbai terror attack (2008).
Disappointing communique
When the BRICS communique was released, we scoured the paragraphs to find the reference to Pakistan. There was

none. We blinked, read the communique again, but there was no reference. We looked for a reference to the Uri attack and words of sympathy for India. Again, no. All that we found, buried in paragraph 57, were the following words:
“We strongly condemn the recent several attacks, against some BRICS countries, including that in India.”
What was the meaning of the word ‘that’? Was it a grudging reference to the Uri attack? No one has bothered to

explain to the people of India the non-reference to Uri when the summit took place in India within a month of the

Uri attack, that left 19 soldiers dead.
There was more. Two paragraphs below there was a message to the world, India included:
“All counter terrorism measures should uphold international law and respect human rights.”
Counter-terrorism measures are taken by countries that are the victims of terrorist attacks. India’s recent cross-

LoC action was one such measure. Did the communique imply that India had violated international law? Did it imply

that India did not respect human rights?
Self-interest prevails
While there was no reference to the Uri attack and no reference to Pakistan or the JeM or the LeT, the communique named a notorious terror group: the Islamist State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Only one other terrorist group, the Jabhat al-Nusra (in Syria), was named. The references were not accidental. Both Russia and China feel threatened by ISIL (also known as ISIS). Russia has a special interest in Syria. Hence the naming of ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra. For the same reasons, Russia and China need the support of Pakistan.
Last month, Russia concluded a military exercise with Pakistan. At the United Nations, China blocked India’s

efforts to name Masood Azhar as a terrorist and put curbs on his activities. After the BRICS Summit, China went a step further and, in the unkindest cut of all, China’s spokesperson said, “Everyone knows that India and Pakistan

are victims of terrorism. Pakistan has made huge efforts and great sacrifices in fighting terrorism. I think that the international community should respect this.”
That is the real world. The real world fears an escalation of a conflict between two countries that have nuclear

weapons and, therefore, is unwilling to pour oil on the fire. Besides, each country has its self-interest to

protect. For Russia, it is the situation in Afghanistan and the ISIS’s threat to its territory via Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyztan. For China, it is its investments in Pakistan, the Road and Belt initiative and access to Gwadar port.
That is not to suggest that India is friendless in the world. It is only to emphasise that, despite the government’s efforts, Pakistan is also not friendless in the world. After the Uri attack, the government did the right thing in allowing the Army to take cross-LoC action. The Army also did the right thing in making a measured statement through the DGMO. Message conveyed, the line should have been drawn there. It was not, and expectations of support were built high. Hence the feeling among the people of India of being let down by our BRICS partners.
At least now the government should tacitly acknowledge the wisdom of ‘strategic restraint’. It is time to end the rhetoric and the celebrations and go back to deterrence, diplomacy, engagement and talks."

CALLING THE joint declaration issued after the BRICS summit a reflection of the BJP-led government’s “absolute and abject failure” on the diplomatic front, Congress on Monday pointed out that the document neither mentions the Uri attack as an act of terror nor names Pakistan-based terror groups, even as it specifically names the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Syria’s Jubhat al-Nusra.

There was also no mention of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan, the main opposition party argued.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress leader Manish Tewari said the Modi government could not even convince fellow BRICS members that the attack on Indian soldiers in Uri last month was a terrorist strike. Even the word terror does not find mention in the condemnation issued in the joint declaration, he said.
Tewari said while the government is involved in chest-thumping after the September 29 strikes along the LoC, “where it has to speak, it is completely and absolutely deafening in its silence”. “The Goa declaration is perhaps the most sterling example of the government’s abject failure.”"

As the host to the BRICS summit in Goa this weekend India will lay out the red carpet for the leaders of the group which was once seen to consist of the five emerging economies. Now, with the Brazilian and South African economies in slow motion, Russia struggling and China and India not growing as they earlier were, the grouping’s economic strength has taken a beating.
Despite this, the West still watches the moves made by BRICS warily and follows its announcements very carefully, especially since the substantive part of the summits have been political in nature in the recent years.
The summit declarations have gotten longer – the Ufa declaration was more than 70 paragraphs long — and have increasingly dwelt on topical political issues.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
WATCH VIDEO:  PM Narendra Modi Optimistic About BRICS Summit: Here’s What He Said

 
Since India is hosting the summit, it has invited countries from its eastern neighbourhood – under the umbrella of BIMSTEC that includes Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal – for an outreach with the BRICS leaders. Begun at the summit in Fortaleza 2014, this practice was adhered by Russia in Ufa in 2015, when the host called leaders from the countries in the region. So, Brazil had called the Latin American countries in Fortaleza for an outreach with the BRICS leaders (that was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first multi-lateral outing), and Russia had called the central Asian and countries part of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation).
However, since Pakistan was seen as a spoiler in the region, India decided to exclude them from the regional outreach, one reason being it wanted to avoid the inevitable China-Pakistan axis at the BRICS summit. This was much before a majority of the SAARC countries decided to pull out of the SAARC summit in Islamabad, forcing its postponement.
Instead, India called the neighbours in the east – under the rubric of its Act-East policy.
But there is no doubt that the Pakistan factor will definitely loom large over the BRICS summit – especially after the surgical strikes in the post-Uri attack phase. India is cautious in not making the mistake of putting Pakistan at the fore of the agenda but through the arc of terrorism it will ensure that all countries from BRICS and BIMSTEC are on the same page.
It will be interesting to see how China responds to Delhi’s moves as they are Islamabad’s all-weather friends.
As a commentator in Goa rightly observed, “Whatever gathering the South Asia region may host, be it SAARC or BRICS or BIMSTEC, the India-Pakistan equation is always bound to play on everyone’s minds.”"

The government on Thursday said it had decided to “stop” the waters in the three “eastern rivers” of the Indus basin from flowing into Pakistan, and instead divert the flow to supply waters to “our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab”.
The waters of three eastern rivers of the Indus basin — Ravi, Sutlej and Beas — have been assigned entirely for use by India under the 1960 Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan. The three western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab — are supposed to flow “unrestricted” to Pakistan under the treaty, though India, being the upstream country, is allowed to use the waters in a “non-consumptive” manner.
However, India has not been using all the waters of the eastern rivers, and this unutilised water flows down to Pakistan. It is this flow of unutilised water to Pakistan that the government has decided to stop, Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari said in a series of messages on Twitter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Under the leadership of Hon’ble PM Sri Narendra Modi ji, our government has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan. We will divert water from eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab,” Gadkari said.
“The construction of dam has started at Shahpur-Kandi (in Punjab) on Ravi river. Moreover, Ujh project will store our share of water for use in J&K and the balance water will flow from 2nd Ravi-Beas Link to provide water to other basin states. All the above projects are declared as national projects.”
Ujh is a tributary of Ravi in Jammu and Kashmir.
The decision to make full utilisation of its entire entitlement of Indus waters was taken in the wake of the Uri attack in 2016. At that time, the Indian government had suspended the routine talks between the Indus Water Commissioners of the two countries, with Prime Minister Modi asserting that “blood and water” could not flow together. The talks, which are held routinely to exchange information about water flows in accordance with the Indus Water Treaty, were reinstated in March 2017.
A high-level task force had been constituted under Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra in December 2016 to decide on the measures to be taken to ensure full utilisation of India’s share of waters under the treaty. The task force had recommended restarting work on several water projects in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab that had been pending for years.
The Shahpur-Kandi project and the Ujh project were among those that were revived as a result. The Shahpur-Kandi project, located in Gurdaspur district of Punjab, involves construction of a 55.5-m-high dam on Ravi river. It aims at providing irrigation facility to 5,000 hectares of land in Punjab and 32,173 hectares in Jammu and Kashmir, besides generating 206 MW of electricity.
Work on the project, which is estimated to cost Rs 2,285.81 crore at 2008 prices, had begun in 1999. It was later classified as a National Project by the Centre. However, the project was stalled following objections raised by the Jammu and Kashmir government on a number of issues, including power-sharing, design and monitoring.
In March 2017, the Centre brokered peace between the two states, paving the way for resumption of the project.
Similarly, the Ujh project in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir was revived in 2017, with the Central Water Commission having prepared and submitted a fresh detailed project report for a multipurpose hydropower project that is likely to generate 186 MW of electricity and provide irrigation to 30,000 hectares of land. The estimated cost is about Rs 5,000 crore. Work has not yet started at the project site.
Regarding Gadkari’s tweets, a government official said that no new decision had been taken. “This is not a new decision. The minister is simply reiterating what he has always said. He is talking about diverting India’s share of Indus water which was going to Pakistan, and he has always been saying this,” an official of the Water Resources Ministry said."

Meanwhile, the cultural calendar is buzzing with several exhibitions and performances
Reclaiming their Pull
The din over a much-desired reinvention of Shah Rukh Khan grew louder when he failed to woo the audience as the wearisome tourist guide in Jab Harry Met Sejal, while Ranbir Kapoor’s much-awaited Jagga Jasoos failed to make a mark. Aanand L Rai’s untitled next features Khan as a dwarf and Rajkumar Hirani’s next, based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt, has Kapoor as the lead. These movies offer possibilities to both the actors to move away from stereotyping. With Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, Kangana Ranaut will get a chance to prove her box-office pull that floundered in 2017 when Simran released.
Pairing Up
The year has some new pairs worked out even as some of the veteran co-actors will team up to recreate screen magic. Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy brings together Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt for the first time. Bhatt is cast opposite Vicky Kaushal in Meghna Gulzar-directed Raazi while Nawazuddin Siddqui is working with Rasika Dugal in the Nandita Das-directed Manto biopic. Some old pairs would be back: Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif are reunited with Shah Rukh Khan in Rai’s next, Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor in Umesh Shukla-directed 102 Not Out; and Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit in Indra Kumar’s Total Dhamaal.
True Taleshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Aditya Dhar-directed Uri is based on the Uri attacks and its aftermath. It features Vicky Kaushal and Paresh Rawal in lead roles. Super 30, directed by Vikas Bahl, is a biopic based on the life of mathematician Anand Kumar, who is known to have a perfect record of getting his batch of 30 students to clear IIT-JEE. Hrithik Roshan is currently busy preparing to play Kumar. Vishal Bhardwaj’s Abbottabad captures the last few days of Osama bin Laden while he was in exile. The film is based on a book titled The Exile: The Stunning inside Story of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in Flight.
Let the Games Begin
The big announcement from the Ministry of Culture in 2017 was the Theatre Olympics. To be held between February 17 and April 8, 2018, the event will have 500 productions from 17 states. Among the selections are Bisadkal by Prabir Guha’s Alternative Living Theatre, Debashis Ray’s Char Oddyay, Man of the Heart by Suman Mukherjee, Beyond Chitrangadha by Sanchaita Basu, Macbeth Mirror by Santanu Das, Bhelay Bhase Sita by Tarun Pradhan and Rajrokto by Bibhash Chakraborty.
Turn Up the Margins
The International Theatre Festival of Kerala turns 10 in January, and focusses on the lives unfolding at the margins. Sixteen international and an equal number of Indian plays will be performed between January 20 and 29, in and around the sprawling Sangeetha Nataka Akademi campus in Thrissur. It will feature voices, people and ideas that have been suppressed, dismissed or otherwise undervalued. Seminars will be held on subjects such as “Gendering Theatre” and “Theatres of Resistance”.
A Decade On
The Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum (BDL), Mumbai’s oldest museum, has had a tumultuous history — from opening as a natural history museum in 1857, called the Victoria and Albert Museum, to getting its present name in 1957, to falling into disrepair in 1997 and then finally, reopening to the public in 2008 with a new vision. To celebrate their 10th anniversary, the BDL will be opening the year with a major exhibition, titled “Asymmetrical Objects”, on January 19. The show meditates on the current Anthropocene epoch and will feature works by Atul Bhalla, Jitish Kallat, Manish Nai, Mithu Sen, Prajakta Potnis and Ranbir Kaleka.
Another Shade
The fourth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale is awaited for more reasons that one — spearheaded by a woman curator for the first time, there is ample curiosity regarding Anita Dube’s selection of works and artists. Speaking about her vision, Dube had stated, “My subjectivity and worldview will be involved. I am interested in bringing in the voices of those who have been marginalised: women, dalits, the gay community.” To be held between December 2018 and March 2019, the Biennale has only announced one participant till now — Baroda-based Nilima Sheikh.
Fair Ground
Founded by Neha Kirpal in 2008, this is the first year when the India Art Fair will not have her at the helm. Jagdip Jagpal, who has worked on a number of cultural projects in the UK, China and the South Asian region, has taken over as director of the annual fair. To be held from February 9 to 12 in Delhi, the fair will see participation from several domestic and international galleries. Platform, which acts as a springboard for emerging art practices and art collectives from South Asia, will welcome tribal art forms and Delhi Crafts Council for the first time.

Wedding Band
The union of Bollywood and fashion is a marriage made in heaven and all set to add to the band, baaja, bridal vibe this year will be film-producer-cum-stylist Rhea and actor sister Sonam Kapoor’s next home production, Veere Di Wedding. The venture — starring Sonam, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania — is likely to get a thumbs-up in the styling department, thanks to Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, who have turned costume designers for the project. The film releases in May.
Ten on Ten
It has been a decade since Sanjay Garg formally launched Raw Mango at the Dastkari Haat Samiti exhibition in Mumbai. This year, Garg is set to celebrate a decade of his unique take on traditional textiles with the launch of “Midnight”, featuring hand-painted plants rendered on silk, organza and tissue saris at the beginning of the year. Not only will he be creating other collections featuring chikankari, chanderi, brocades and more through 2018, he is also working on a special presentation and several exciting collaborations.
Mark Up
The prestigious International Woolmark Prize competition will have a marked Indian presence this year as well. With past winners such as Rahul Mishra and Suket Dhir leaving their mark on the global fashion scene, this year will see two more regional finalists from India compete for the coveted title. Antar Agni by Ujjawal Dubey and Ruchika Sachdev of Bodice are the menswear and womenswear finalists, respectively, from the Indian subcontinent and the Middle-East regional rounds. They will compete for the grand prize in Florence on January 9.
Home Grown
Mindful eating has ensured a purposive shift to organically cultivated food and this trend will continue in 2018. More people are incorporating super-foods such as amaranth, sorghum and finger millets into their diets. Even restaurants are making concerted choices to assimilate this shift. However, apart from making these ingredients readily available, a culture of regular consumption needs to be cultivated.
Flower Power
Taking a hint from Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, chefs will ensure vibrancy on the plate by putting the diverse edible flora of the country to frequent use. While hibiscus and elderflower made appearances in our drinks in 2017 and rose has been a favoured garnish in desserts, flowers like the abundantly found genda or marigold, mint and cilantro flowers, banana and pumpkin blossoms, sunflower, lavender, lilac and jasmine will probably be featured regularly on our platters.
Finding Roots
Nearly a dozen of India’s best-known design firms will come together to examine themes of the city, the act of building, the idea of history, and professional process as part of the exhibition “The Death of Architecture”. The show begins on February 23 in Mumbai, and will travel to 15 other Indian cities. While architect Samira Rathod looks at a tobacco town in the outskirts of Vadodara, architect Pramod Balakrishnan investigates a temple town near Chennai, and architect Riyaz Tayyibji questions the engagement with the centre and the periphery.
Equal Measure
What could possibly be common between Charles Correa and Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur? An exhibition on contemporary architecture in India, titled “When is Space?”, curated by Rupali Gupte and Prasad Shetty, presents multi-scale intersections between the architect and the king. Presented at the Jawahar Kala Kendra, the event will open on January 21, and aims to mark the similarities in several of their projects.
Crisis at Home
The exhibition “State of Housing – Aspirations, Imaginaries and Realities in India” will bring together the varied perspectives that go into the understanding of housing, which includes architects, urban designers, planners, local governance bodies, real-estate developers, financial institutions and policymakers. Curated by Rahul Mehrotra, Ranjit Hoskote and Kaiwan Mehta, the showcase will be held at Goethe Institut – Max Mueller Bhavan, Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, from February 2 onwards.
Music in the Park
After a short hiatus, when SPICMACAY held its famed “music in the park concert” in 2010, they chose Pt Ravi Shankar to restart the series in Delhi’s Nehru Park. On a cold December evening, he had played a memorable concert with daughter Anoushka by his side. She’d pick up from wherever he would leave — learning, presenting, all at the same time. While Shankar mesmerised his audience in what was to be his last concert in the Capital, Anoushka faltered often. But that has changed in the last seven years and the 35-year-old has come into her own. In 2018, she will take the prestigious Nehru Park stage, which has mostly been graced by much senior artistes and also had her father as a fixture. Will she find success and an audience?
Celebrating Rahman
It was in 1992 that AR Rahman entered our consciousness with Mani Ratnam’s Roja, a film with compositions that became a part of our being through their simplicity and inventiveness. Rahman will return to the city of his birth, Chennai, in January to conclude the 25-year celebration of his career through a visual and audio extravaganza. At a concert titled “Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow”, Rahman will present various pieces of significance from his oeuvre."

THE SPRAWLING green spaces surrounding the Open Hand monument are abuzz with activity, the creative and artistic kind, as young artists and students are working with varied materials to create art that echoes the spirit of Chandigarh and complements the majestic surroundings of the Capitol Complex, now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
An effort of the Chandigarh Lalit Kala Akademi, as part of the ongoing Arts and Heritage Festival, the art installation workshop is a work in progress, and a chance for two professional artists and teams of students from the Chandigarh College of Arts and Chandigarh College of Architecture to express their thoughts, ideas, philosophies, hopes for Chandigarh through artistic creations, in this case installations. According to Bheem Malhotra, the chairperson of the Akademi, there wasn’t any theme given for the workshop, but all teams have related their art to the city and the venue of their work.
Stitch by stitch, Manjot Kaur is creating the ‘Human Heartbeat’, an installation that has colour, movement and a larger connect. Using fabric, thread, needles and bamboo, Kaur as part of the work also wants to promote the traditional materials and techniques of Punjab. “As we are working at a world UNESCO heritage site, my work calls for the need for peace, prosperity, love and empathy. We may all live in different spaces, have our own circumstances, needs, limitations, challenges. but we have the same heartbeat,” explains Kaur, who will use bamboo to give the installation movement and height.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Not too far away, Kanwal Pal is slowly and steadily hanging brass plates, which when the wind blows, create a unique sound and with the Sun’s rays, shine bright. A platform below has figures of children, in complete bliss, after a playful session of rolling in the mud. It’s an installation that Pal says is inspired by the bell that would ring at the end of the day at school, and the complete and freedom that he and his friends experienced. “The space here is also about freedom, open sky, green surroundings, silence giving the visitors a joy that’s priceless,” smiles Pal.
‘Dream Catchers’ is what a team of students of applied art title their work, with the installation comprising many elements — nets, a 13-foot frame representing the O pen Hand, tin wings, a cannon and flowers. According to Tanya Mehtani and Gayatri, the concept is to give meaning to the surroundings, as the work is inspired by freedom, positivity and peace and they are using primary colours, as used by Corbusier here. The installation is also a tribute to those soldiers who sacrificed their life in the Uri attack. “The cannons will be filled with flowers, as the wind blows, the tin wings will work as chimes, as the nets will catch the dreams we all have for Chandigarh and a dove in the shape of Open Hand will fly high,” explain the team members.Chandigarh NewsTika Utsav concludes, Punjab fails to hit its daily target even onceSukhbir promises Dalit deputy CM if voted to power, BJP the CM post3,329 fresh cases, 63 more deaths in PunjabClick here for more
From construction materials such as iron, woods, bricks that Corbusier used here, to the basic colours that we see at the Capitol Complex, a team from the College of Architecture is busy making a frame through which people can get a view of the Assembly, while another team is using architectural and art elements to create an optical illusion with a glass box and poly-bird hovering in the air. With various objects and materials, a group of students of sculpture are working on a portrait of Le Corbusier, which would be seen from the middle f two gates being made. Elsewhere, using sound as an element, a group is working with ghungroos to make a beehive, and covering the tree with white material for the hive to have an impact. The installation workshop is open to the public till October 9, and work is nearing final stages near the Open Hand."

The relationship between India and Pakistan have been soured by the recent attacks in Uri and Pathankot, and there’s has been turmoil over Pakistani actors working in Bollywood, but one person has been repetitively risen above all this to spread the love.
Helping people in distress is not new to Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj; be it a distress call from Kuwait or Indians in Yemen she has promptly replied to people on social media. She have stood in front of the world at UNGA and sent a strong message to Pakistan after the Uri attack and Kashmir controversy, but at the same time helped a young Pakistani girl and won hearts.
Last month, a young man appealed to her after his would-be-bride and her family was having troubles to get visa. Naresh Tewani from Jodhpur has been engaged to Priya Bachchani from Karachi for past three years. The couple died to tie a knot in India but owing to the growing spat between the two countries the chances seemed very bleak. With just one left for the wedding, Tewani sought Swaraj’s help and said she was his last resort.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tewani on October 5, tweeted to Swaraj saying, “Mam my marriage is on 7th Nov. My fiance is from Karachi, Pak. Her family didn’t getting the visa. Nw only u r my hope. pls help.” Swaraj on being aware of the crisis replied to him on October 7 and assured “we will issue visa” and asked him not to worry.



But the minister kept her promise and the bride and the family arrived in India on time for the wedding. According to a Times of India report, the bride-to-be and her family arrived in Jodhpur on Sunday and the two families are extremely delighted and grateful to her.
“I am very happy that everything has gone on as planned and we are enjoying the ceremonies here,” the report quoted the bride. The happy groom said, “We are thankful for the quick response of the minister. All the 35 members got their visas to come to Jodhpur, though, in two parts.”

Priya Bachchani from #Karachi, who reached #India Sunday, will tie the knot with Naresh Tewani of Jodhpur today.

Pakistan’s deep state took a major risk in executing the Pulwama attack. It clearly assessed that unless it could sponsor a spectacular terror-related event in Kashmir by early 2019, the comprehensive Indian approach towards conflict management initiated since 2017 could effectively prevent it from further calibration of the situation in Kashmir. An element of irrationality continued to remain a part of Pakistan’s policy. It is important to revisit Pakistan’s 30-year-old strategy to determine why it suddenly felt insecure and hesitant from 2016 onwards.
The chain of events in Kashmir and part of the Indian counter-strategy, which appeared to unnerve Pakistan’s deep state, need to be reviewed to get the right perspective.
From 1989 onwards, Pakistan pursued hybrid war as the core of its strategy. Its then ambiguous nuclear status was exploited in the post-Cold War period, when nuclear strategies were in a state of flux. Pakistan’s intent was the long-term emasculation of New Delhi’s policy on J&K and attempt to embarrass India by internationalising the issue — the Simla Agreement’s provision of bilateralism was never respected by Islamabad and Rawalpindi. From 1998 onwards, when both nations became overtly nuclear-armed, Pakistan become bolder — Kargil 1999 and the attack on Parliament in 2001 seemed to be based on the assumption that the nuclear overhang had closed the window for an effective conventional Indian response. Perhaps the decision not to cross the LoC in 1999, taken for completely different reasons by the Vajpayee government, and the long standoff of 2002 (Operation Parakram) appeared to substantiate India’s reluctance. Seven years later, the Mumbai terror attack, too, made Indian reluctance to execute hot pursuit more evident.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The nature of the proxy, hybrid conflict started to change from 2013 onwards when a generational transition in local terror content was apparent. Burhan Wani and his cohorts were reluctant to listen to, and were less under the control of, elements from across the LoC. As its big ticket capability waned, Pakistan’s deep state panicked. In addition, there was a sudden change in the stance of the Indian government in mid-2015. The deep state has never been comfortable with talks and did not support Nawaz Sharif. In 2016, it conducted the Pathankot attack in India’s hinterland and in September that year, the Uri attack close to the LoC. The year ended with the Nagrota terror attack.
The year 2016 turned out to be decisive and saw a change in the nature and dynamics of hybrid conflict in J&K. The Indian government responded in a graduated way — activity at the LoC increased, followed by the surgical strikes in September 2016 post the Uri attack. The strikes were essentially experimental but provided sufficient inputs to strategise beyond just the tactical level. The perception of a lack of Indian response below the nuclear threshold was effectively breached.
In 2016-17, while the deep state succeeded in bringing mobs to the streets, the Indian government was bold about upping the ante in its counter-terrorist strategy. While Operation All Out was launched to neutralise attempts at increasing the terror footprint, the less visible but extremely effective measures were those that targeted the Pakistan-sponsored ecosystem. This ecosystem comprising a combination of human resources such as over ground workers (OGWs), ideologues and separatists, had permeated the very core of Kashmir. Combined with complex financial networks and an effective communication strategy evolved by Pakistan’s Inter State Public Relations (ISPR), it had matured over time. It was given space to function by the persistent Indian strategy to primarily count upon physical neutralisation of terror groups, limiting infiltration and preventing fresh local recruitment, which became rife after 2013.
Editorial | Balakot lessons: IAF review of the cross LoC operation points to the urgent need to speed up modernisation of the force
Most countries have followed this model when facing similar problems as India’s. However, the new Indian strategy from 2017 surprised Pakistan. It took some time for Pakistan to realise how subtly this change had taken place, even as the Indian Army went on the kinetic offensive re-adopting some of its practices from the Nineties. By the end of 2018, Pakistan was already on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The Indian National Investigation Agency (NIA) was succeeding in dismantling financial networks and the separatists had become increasingly irrelevant. With the Indian general elections then scheduled for March-April 2019, the deep state assessed that a terror-related event could, with some effort, be branded a “false flag” operation. This assumption came on grounds that the Narendra Modi government would seek a return to office on the back of nationalist fervour generated by Pulwama. The Balakot-type response 12 days later was unexpected, but demonstrated political will, military escalation control and a willingness to engage internationally to neutralise Pakistani propaganda.
The international support that Balakot garnered, the run of military success against terrorist cadres post Pulwama-Balakot and the added political stability at the Centre gave the Indian government the confidence to execute long-awaited political initiatives. Pakistan’s attempt to gain greater relevance in Afghanistan through the US and President Donald Trump’s ill-informed offer to mediate on J&K, acted as triggers for the decisions of August 5, 2019 — to rescind the special constitutional provisions for J&K.
With a communication lockdown, the political community under strictures and the ecosystem under progressive neutralisation, the time since has seen Pakistan relatively ineffective in the conduct of hybrid war. Now with FATF unrelenting on Pakistan to do more to dismantle the terror infrastructure, an economy which is causing major concern, and the focus shifting to the management of the US interests in Afghanistan, Pakistan finds itself in a dilemma. Internal demands to wind up terror networks are increasing.
Explained: Why Balakot is a watershed
All this may point towards Pakistan adopting a more rational course in J&K and preventing situations which it will clearly be in no position to handle. Much depends on the nature of the Afghanistan deal and the extent of Pakistan’s involvement. The expectation that the summer of 2020 in J&K will yet be stable may be right but predictions about J&K and applying rationality to Pakistan’s actions may not always be the correct approach. India must maintain a tight control, prevent the ecosystem’s potential for revamp and remain prepared for all eventualities. The summer of 2020 will be a major decider about the future course of the J&K proxy conflict.

Security forces will work on their strategy to deal with ‘fidayeen attacks’ by terrorists which have emerged as a “major challenge”, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said in Jalandhar while citing the Pathankot attack in January and the Uri incident on September 18.
“These are challenges to our security,” the Finance Minister said, condemning the terrorist attack at the rear office of infantry battalion in Uri town, which left 17 security personnel dead.
“.. Pathankot and Uri (terror attacks) appear to indicate that these (fidayeen attacks) have restarted again. And I think this is a major challenge which I am sure our security forces will gear up to respond,” Jaitley told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that in recent years there had been an increasing reliance “on activities like stone throwing agitations” which were instigated from across the border.
He said the terror attacks “have nothing to do with complexion of the governments in power at the Centre.”
Replying to a question, he said, “such (like Uri attack) security situations are handled by security forces… on the basis of political statements, response is not given”.
Asked about a recent statement of Pakistan Defence Minister that if the neighbouring country will need to use nuclear weapons for their survival they will, Jaitley said, “This is an irresponsible statement. Such statements are condemnable and the world also does not accept such threats.” Heavily armed militants stormed a battalion in the rear office of infrantry battalion in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours today, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the strike in which four ultras were neutralised.

In January, seven military personnel were killed when six terrorists attacked the Pathankot air base."

Nana Patekar urged people not to heed Bollywood actors as they are trivial when compared to the country. The actor was speaking about a call to ban Pakistani actors in the aftermath of Uri attack in which 18 soldiers were killed.
Nana Patekar said that matter of Pakistani actors working in India is mere trifle when it comes to country. “I don’t know anything else other than my country. An artiste is very small in front of a country. As artistes, we don’t have value when it comes to country,” said Patekar during an interaction with the media on Sunday.

Patekar also made it clear that the country comes first for him. ” I was in the army and have spent two and half years there. I know who are our biggest heroes. No one can be a bigger hero than our jawans. Our jawans are our real heroes,” said Patekar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When asked about how Bollywood is divided on the issue, Patekar said, “We actors are trivial and insignificant. Please don’t pay attention to what we say.”
Patekar didn’t take any names of those who have different opinions. However, he said, ” I am talking about those people only. They don’t have the status to comment on these issues.”
Salman Khan had earlier said “They (Pakistani Actors) are artists, not terrorists. It’s the government who gives them work permits and visas. Art and terrorism should not be mixed.”

MNS chief Raj Thackeray, at a press conference, spoke at length about the matter. Taking the war of words to a level higher, Raj said “Are we short of artists in our country? Why do we need Pakistani artists to work in our films? I don’t understand. Jawans are fighting for us at borders.What’ll happen if they decide to put down their weapons? Who’ll guard our borders? Salman Khan? These artists should realise ‘Nation first’. If they have so much problem, we will ban their movies too”."

Intelligence inputs have revealed that following the Uri attack, Pakistan Rangers has canceled the leave of its personnel deployed along the Indo-Pak border in J&K and Punjab in apprehension of a retaliation from Indian forces.
Highly placed sources in the Army informed The Indian Express that the Headquarters of the Pakistan Rangers in Lahore issued these directions immediately after the Uri attack. A senior officer informed that the number of Pakistan Rangers deployed along the border have also been increased and that any gaps which existed in their deployment due to shortage of manpower have also been filled.

‘The intelligence intercepts and ground based information also reveals that the senior officers of the Rangers, including those who hold the appointment of Wing Commander have also been asked to position themselves in forward areas. The Wing Commanders have, in fact, been instructed to stay overnight in forward locations till the situation is re-assessed by higher headquarters”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
There are several posts of Pakistan Rangers which are known to be functioning as staging posts to infiltrate terrorirts belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammad as well as Lashkar-e-Toiba. These terrorists are first concentrated in a detachment in Sialkot before they are dispersed to different locations of Pakistan Rangers posts along the Indo-Pak border to be pushed into India.
The Border Security Force (BSF) deployment along the Indo-Pak border has also been put on heightened alert after the Uri attack. The traditional routes of infiltration along various ‘nullahs’ which abut the Indo-Pak border starting from the Pathankot sector in Punjab to jammu have been placed under increased surveillance in order to prevent any ingress of terrorists, inform BSF officials.
Meanwhile, the GOC-in-C Western Command, Lt Gen Surinder Singh, is also learnt to have visited the Jammu military station and order border deployments to take stock of the security situation along the Indo-Pak border in the area. This was the first visit of the Army Commander after taking over on Friday. The Army’s Western command is responsible for the defence of the International Border till Akhnoor.
During the visit to Jammu, Kathua and Samba areas, Lt Gen Surinder took stock of the security apparatus in the sensitive areas. He reviewed the deployment in the entire region and emphasized on the need for ensuring high degree of alertness and operational preparedness. He also stressed upon the need to coordinate the intelligence network of all agencies in the region so that prompt actions can be undertaken to defeat the designs of the adversary.
The Army units along the Pathankot-Jammu highway and in the vicinity of Pathankot have also been put on increased alert following the Uri attack. There are several such units which dot the area and after the terror attack on Dinanagar and then Pathankot the state of preparedness in this area had always been higher than normal, a senior officer disclosed. However, no specific information regarding this area had been circulated, he added."

(File)
Maulana Masood Azhar, the chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad, is suspected to be suffering from renal failure and is under regular dialysis at an army hospital in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, officials told news agency PTI. This comes a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that Azhar was “too unwell to leave the house”
Azhar is the mastermind behind Jaish-e-Mohammad – the organisation that has carried out multiple attacks on India over the last nearly two decades, including the recent Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF officers. India has been repeatedly trying to list him as a “global terrorist” at the United Nations Security Council.
Earlier during an interaction with CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour, Qureshi said, “Azhar is in Pakistan. According to my information, he is very unwell. He is unwell to the extent that he can’t leave his house, because he’s really unwell.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Jaish-e-Mohammad chief was a close associate of Osama bin Laden, terror motivator in several African countries and also known by many as the Pakistani cleric who brought jihad into the religious discourse at mosques in the UK, the official said. Azhar was in fact released by India in exchange for freeing the hijacked Indian Airlines aircraft IC-814 on December 31, 1999, in Kandahar
According to Indian agencies, After 9/11, Laden was cornered and the JeM became the key conduit to bring fighters and their families from Afghanistan into safe havens in Pakistan, run by JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba. While describing the capability of Jaish, India’s draft proposal at UNSC said, “JeM is an organisation that does not just impact India, but feeds on pan-Islamism and has been a major threat to global peace and security.”

Besides the attacks in Pulwama and Pathankot, the draft proposal names Azhar for the 2016 Uri attack where which a group of four Jaish terrorists attacked an Army brigade headquarters near the Line of Control and killed 17 Army personnel and injured another 30. The dossier further lists dozens of other attacks carried out by Jaish on security forces and Army installations in J&K from 2000-2014, the IC 814 hijacking that helped secure Azhar’s release and the 2001 Parliament attack after his release.
New Delhi has also been mounting pressure on Islamabad to dismantle the Jaish infrastructure and curb its finances. After Pulwama attack, it conducted air strike at a training camp in Balakot run by Azhar’s kin."

THE names of two detainees accused by the government of being guides for the terrorists who attacked the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri figured on a list given to the Pakistan High Commission of detainees who could be repatriated home, a top Pakistan diplomat has told The Indian Express.

The two detainees, the diplomat said, were given access to a team from the Pakistan High Commission on December 5 when its officials held a routine meeting with prisoners from their country in Amritsar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Government officials confirmed this meeting but declined to comment on whether the two suspects’ names figured in the list of several Pak nationals who could be repatriated home — an admission of their innocence. This was one of three meetings, the Pak diplomat said, at New Delhi, Jaipur and Amritsar where Pak detainees from various regional prisons are brought for either verification or repatriation.
Watch What Else Is making News

The government said Islamabad had submitted no request for the repatriation of the two suspects, possibly fearing reciprocal requests from New Delhi — a sign of a high-stakes game of national prestige that could ensure both spends months, or even years, in prison.
Faisal Husain Awan, a resident of Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and his school-friend Ahsan Khursheed, from Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil, were alleged by the Ministry of External Affairs to have “confessed to facilitating” the infiltration of a group of four Jaish-e-Muhammad cadre who carried out the Uri attack.
However, documents and accounts provided by the family of Awan published in the The Indian Express last week suggest the two may have been Class 10 students who strayed across the Line of Control in error. The Indian Express report showed the two had been at home on September 18, the day of the attack, and then skipped a planned school trip to Murree on September 21, the day they were arrested near Uri.
“Pakistan High Commission staff indeed met with the two juveniles on December 5 and were told they could be repatriated home”, a spokesperson for the mission told The Indian Express. “We are in the process of taking next steps”.
Islamabad’s account of the December 5 meeting, if corroborated, could have far-reaching consequences for Awan and Khursheed who are listed as 18 and 19 years old in an FIR filed by the Army which forms the basis of the ongoing criminal proceedings against them by the National Investigation Agency.
NIA officials are yet to conduct forensic tests to establish the age of the two suspects. NIA sources said they have no legal reason to doubt the facts in the FIR until the documentation obtained by The Indian Express is made available to them officially. The two suspects have also had no access to counsel so far, sources said.
NIA Director-General Sharad Kumar declined to comment on the December 5 meeting. A senior NIA official said the agency had not been kept informed of the meeting by the Ministry of Home Affairs. He said the NIA was currently proceeding on the assumption that “our investigation is on”. The NIA is expected to take a decision on filing charges against the two individuals inside weeks.
Asked for clarification on the Pakistan High Commission’s claims to have been informed it could repatriate the two detainees, a Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson told The Indian Express: “The NIA has had no formal communication in this regard from the Ministry of External Affairs or the Ministry of Home Affairs. Unless they have a formal communication, the NIA cannot move ahead”.
Pakistan’s meeting with the two suspects on December 5 has also raised questions, officials said, over its failure to act on their behalf since then.
A Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said he was unaware of the December 5 meeting adding that the Pakistan High Commission had made no request to New Delhi for arrangements to be made for the repatriation of Awan and Khursheed. “There has been no correspondence at all on this issue”, the spokesperson said.
“These two have got caught in maze that involves questions of diplomatic reciprocity and national standing”, a senior official said. “Had Pakistan been serious about repatriating these two individuals”, an MEA official said, “it would have moved the necessary paperwork between December 5 and now. The reason it is not doing so is that doesn’t want to face the embarrassment of being asked why it’s willing to seek consular access for its nationals, while denying them to Indian nationals in Pakistan”.
Islamabad, the official said, had also made no effort to seek consular access to the two individuals after Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit was given a dossier bearing details of their alleged confession — in line with its practice in all cases involving Pakistani nationals alleged to be involved with terrorism.
New Delhi has served multiple diplomatic démarches seeking consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Iran-based Indian national arrested by Pakistan in March on charges of being a Research and Analysis Wing Agent. Islamabad has not so far granted this access.
Earlier this month, Pak media had reported that the country’s de-facto Foreign Minister, Sartaj Aziz, had told its Senate that legally compelling evidence had yet to be gathered of Jadhav’s guilt — reports the Foreign Ministry later denied."

Akshay Kumar could well end up becoming the Bharat Kumar of this era. After Airlift and Rustom where he displayed his patriotic fervour for our country, the actor has now inked another sports drama called Gold which revolves around the story of the first gold won by free India in Olympics in London in 1948. The movie is produced by Excel entertainment and will be directed by Reema Kagti.
Talking about the reason behind signing Akshay, producer Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel told indianexpress.com, “Akshay Kumar is a great actor who is doing some great work. I and Farhan have never worked with him before. We found an opportunity in this script and Reema wanted him. So it’s happened and we are glad.”

Akshay himself had announced the movie using his now famous breaking news tool- Twitter. “Set in 1948, the historic story of India’s first Olympic medal as a free nation, #GOLD coming to you on 15th August 2018,” Akshay had tweeted a couple of days back with a picture of an Olympic gold medal with the Indian tricolour in the background.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Read: Akshay Kumar’s patriotic call to Indians on Uri attack
The Rustom actor has been one of the rare voices of reason in the recent political clamour demanding the ban of Pakistani actors. The actor through a video message urged India to stop fighting among themselves and, instead of debating on banning films and actors, to focus on helping the Indian army and their families. The actor has been doing his bit for the army be it through contributions or playing roles of army officers in movies like Holiday and Rustom.
With August 15, 2018 locked by Akshay Kumar in 2016, one can expect some high patriotic quotient coming alive when Gold releases on India’s 72nd year of Independence Day celebration."

In the wake of the Uri attack, Israel on Friday reiterated its offer of experience and expertise to secure India’s borders.
“Home Minister (Rajnath Singh) visited Israel and he was shown different kinds of borders in Israel with their own uniqueness,” Israeli Ambassador David Carmon said at a press conference ahead of the Israel Homeland Security and Cyber 2016 International Conference to be held in November.

“India has 14 different kinds of borders which are managed by different units and forces,” he said. “When the minister came back and assessed the situation, I am sure he took some of the ideas he saw (into consideration).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Carmon said both countries shared similar challenges in border management and that Israel has solutions for these, adding that the two countries can work together taking into account the capabilities of Israeli companies and government and adapting them to Indian needs.
Stating that Israel has the cyber technology experience of securing borders, Ram Dor, a former Israeli Defence Forces Chief Information Security Officer, said a major problem today was the unauthorised movement of people across borders.
He said Israel is now using electro-optical sensors to collect information via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Israel is a world leader in designing and manufacturing UAVs.
Sensors are also used to collect data and information from towers along borders, said Dor.
He said all the sensors were integrated with a field command and control room “operated by a very intelligent soldier woman”, who directs the Israeli special forces in order to mitigate incoming threats.
“So you can see those are the kind of activities that you can do on your borders,” Dor said."

BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said the Uri attack was part of a “long war” forced on India by Pakistan and declared that the country is committed to giving a “strong reply” to Pak-sponsored terrorism. Shah while echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that those responsible for the terror strike last Sunday will not go unpunished said the attack was a result of Pakistan’s frustration after security forces foiled 17 infiltration attempts.
“The final victory will be ours,” he said. Taking on Pakistan, Shah also asserted that it is no less than a war crime if terrorism becomes part of a government’s policy. In his inaugural address at the party’s National Council, Shah said the party feels the widespread anger in the country as he hit out at Pakistan and supported the Modi government’s diplomatic efforts to corner the neighbour. He later made a separate statement on the raging issue with the Prime Minister and entire top brass of the party present on the dais.
“BJP feels the widespread anger in the people against the conspirators behind the Uri terror attack. BJP and the central government have adopted the policy of zero tolerance against terrorism from the beginning. A strong reply to defeat such terror attempts will be given. 117 terrorists, which is the highest in recent times, have been killed in the last 8 months as the Centre started its strategic and strong fight against terrorism.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Terrorists have made 17 attempts to infiltrate across the border in the last eight months but our brave soldiers have foiled them. The Uri attack has been carried out due to this frustration. This is a long war which has been forced on us by our neighbour. Uri is only its transit destination and not the final outcome. The final victory will be ours,” he said.
“The country is committed to giving a strong reply to this Pakistan-sponsored terrorism,” he said. His remarks came a day after Modi tore into Pakistan over the Uri attack, saying India will not forget it but indicated that his government’s focus will be on isolating Pakistan diplomatically. The party fully supports the government’s diplomatic efforts to expose Pakistan, he said, adding that it has succeeded in showing the country’s true face to the world. Shah noted that Modi has assured the people that those behind the incident will be punished.
“However long is the battle, we will fight it and the victory will be ours.” He appealed to the people and other political parties to support the Centre and the Army in this battle. The world is shocked at Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s reference to Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a “peace-loving youth” and it is an evidence of that country’s involvement in terrorism, he said.
India has long been a victim of Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism and faced several small and big terror attacks in the last many years.
“Pakistan has become a centre of global terrorism,” he said."

In one of the worst terrorist attacks on the Indian Army by fidayeen attackers, at least 17 army jawans were killed in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri when a four-man fidayeen squad attacked the rear office of an Indian Army infantry installation early Sunday morning. Most of the martyred soldiers were from 10 Dogra and 6 Bihar regiments. The initial investigations by the Army indicated the role of Jaish-e-Mohammed in the attack with weapons recovered from the slain terrorists having Pakistan marking.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly condemned the attack and said the perpetrators will be brought to justice. Home Minister Rajnath Singh echoed his sentiments and targeted “terrorist state” Pakistan and said it will be identified and isolated.
Uri town is located barely a few kilometres from the LOC. There is normally heavy presence of army in and around Uri town and on the LoC. The attack, however, has left officials surprised. It comes two years after militants stormed a camp in Mohra in Uri, 15 kilometres away from the location of Sunday’s attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

(Source: PTI Photo)
Reports suggest the attackers sneaked inside the rear office — where most of the battalion’s administrative work is done — at around 5:15 am and started firing indiscriminately. Intense firing ensued between army jawans and the fidayeen attackers. Special forces and paratroopers were airdropped at the base to carry out the encounter. After a lengthy engagement, all four attackers were killed but several jawans were also martyred. Many others were also critically injured.
The Army sent three choppers for support from its 19 divisional headquarters in Baramulla to Uri. The injured personnel were airlifted to Army’s 92 base hospital in Srinagar. The operation was monitored by northern infantry divisional commander based in Baramulla. Security has been beefed up in the sector and the entire town of Uri is sealed and in lockdown. Combing operations in and around the installation are underway and security on vital roads connecting the Line of Control (LOC) has been beefed up.
Addressing the issue, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said: “J&K has always been worst victim of Indo-Pak hostility & its people have been paying a colossal price for same for past over six decades. Heartfelt condolences to bereaved families and also pray for early recovery of those injured in the attack.”
Interestingly, Intelligence officials in Srinagar told The Indian Express that multiple infiltration alerts, including a specific detailed IB alert generated on September 15 warned about the possibility of a fidayeen attack in Uri, possibly by a Pakistani border action team (BAT).
“Our alert was not about a possible skirmish…it mentioned a BAT being mobilised and Uri being the specific target,” a top official said.

Soon after information on the attack in Uri came in public domain, Lt Gen SA Hasnain (retd), a former Brigade Commander in Uri himself and a former GOC of Srinagar-based 15 Corps, tweeted that just ten days back he had warned the present Brigade Commander in Uri about such an attack being in the offing. This clearly shows that information and intelligence of a fidayeen attack existed and was known even to Kashmir watchers.
Sources in Army’s Northern Command as well as the 15 Corps said intelligence suggested Pakistan wanted a ‘spectacular’ strike to demonstrate to the leaders of the civil unrest in the valley that it was not sitting by silently in military aspects.
“The aim was to boost the morale of the civil unrest handlers by assuring them that the capability to hit out across the Line of Control still exists,” said a senior officer.
After the attack, Home Minister Rajnath Singh held a high level security meeting around noon with top Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Defence (MoD) officials at his residence. The meeting was attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Home Secretary Rajeev Mehrishi, Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar, Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, CRPF DG and IB Chief.
Minister of State for Defence Suresh Bhamre said that the barracks inside the compound caught fire during the firing and that led to the heavy casualties. As preventive measures, the MHA issued alert across the country for all airports.
The Prime Minister and other ministers lambasted the perpetrators of the attacked insisting action on the people behind the attacks. They also pulled up Pakistan for its role in the attacks calling it a “terrorist state”. Criticism for Pakistan’s cross-border terror sponsorship came from all political quarters in the country.
Reactions followed
Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad told ANI: “Many terrorists have been killed at the border by our soldiers. May be they were angry because of this. This year, a record of sorts has been created by the soldiers of the Indian Army by killing all the infiltrators from Pakistan in Kashmir. We are very sad about this entire incident and entire country stands behind the Army of our country. We show total solidarity with the forces of our country.”
President Pranab Mukherjee took to Twitter and condemned the attack. He tweeted:


CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury said, “Pakistan must refrain from indulging in cross border terrorism. It should be taken up seriously.”

While former Home Secretary R.K. Singh said: “IF you term it a terror attack then you are misleading yourself. These attacks are planned by ISI and Pakistan Army. Only way to handle these attacks is to hit back.”
International sympathies also followed soon. US ambassador to India Richard Verma said US strongly condemns the terror attack in Uri. “Our thoughts are with families of soldiers who lost their lives,” he said.
Army Chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag visited the injured jawans at the hospital in Srinagar."

(Source: File)
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has held a telephonic conversation with Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif ahead of his speech at the UN in which he is expected to raise the Kashmir issue, amid signs he may tone down his rhetoric to reduce tensions with India. An official from the Prime Minister’s Office said the two on Tuesday night discussed the situation in Kashmir and tense relations with India after the terrorist attack on an Indian army camp in Uri on Sunday in which 18 soldiers were killed. Sharif had a plan to forcefully highlight the Kashmir violence, but the scenario changed after Uri terrorist attack which spotlighted the issue of cross-border militancy.
“The prime minister might strike a balance in his speech. He would talks about the Indian atrocities in Kashmir but also would be conciliatory to end tension,” said the official. Sharif may also offer proposals to address the Kashmir issue, including emphasis on implementing UN resolutions and the mediatory role of the international community.

No statement was issued after the talks between the two Sharifs, which was their first contact since the Uri attack. Geo TV reported that the conversation between the two leaders shows that the situation after Uri attack was serious. The Uri incident was one of the deadliest attacks on Indian Army in recent years, as heavily-armed terrorists stormed a battalion headquarters of the force.
Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed. India’s DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh has said the four killed were foreign terrorists and had carried with them items which had Pakistani markings and that initial reports indicated that they belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-E-Mohammed group. Sharif is poised to address the 71st UNGA session in New York later on Wednesday."

Days after the Uri attack, Indian Army conducted surgical strikes along the LoC in Pakistan where seven terror launch pads were targeted overnight, using heliborne and ground forces on Thursday. Addressing a press conference later, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said India inflicted “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them.
“During these counter terrorist operations significant casualties were caused to terrorists and those providing support to them. The operations aimed at neutralizing terrorists have since ceased. We do not have any plans for further continuation. However, the Indian Armed Forces are fully prepared for any contingency that may arise,” the DGMO said. No Indian casualties occurred during the surgical strikes that were carried out last night by the Indian Army.
Watch what else is making news

PM Narendra Modi had informed President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice President Hamid Ansari and former Prime Minister Mahmohan Singh on the surgical strikes. Neither one of them have officially reacted to Thursday’s operation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury and informed them about the military action on terror launch pads. Even as Ghulam Nabi Azad congratulated the security forces ” for being successful in the operation”, Yechury said, “We have seen our DGMO briefing, saw the Pakistani reaction, besides that we have no official information.”
Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said that her party stands with the government in its actions to protect our country’s security and deal with the menace of terrorism from across the border. In a statement, Gandhi said, “The Congress Party congratulates the armed forces on the success of the operation and offers its support to the government in our country’s continuing battle against cross-border terrorism.” External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj briefed Gandhi about the strikes.
Hailing the Army and PM Modi’s leadership, BJP President Amit Shah said, “In this long war against terrorism a clear response has been given to terrorists by destroying their breeding centre for the first time… (Thursday’s) strikes signal the rise of a new India where the Government doesn’t get cowed down by nefarious designs of terrorists.”
Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu stressed that Pakistan should realise its responsibility towards ensuring peace in the region, he said, “Hope at least now Pakistan will realise its folly and stop aiding and abetting terrorism against India,” adding that, so far, India’s “positive gestures” were only reciprocated through “further encouragement” to terrorists and also “justifying” the terrorist acts.
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that “the real message has been sent to Pakistan”. Reacting to Pakistan calling the strikes “naked” and “unprovoked”, Tharoor said, “What does Pakistan mean by ‘unprovoked’? Killing 18 of our soldiers is not provocation?” adding that, “Whatever Indian Army did was very sensible, measured & proportionate form of retaliation.”
Terming the strikes as a pre-emptive action, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in a series of tweets, “India is capable of repelling all forces that subvert peace in the region…We are proud of #IndianArmy for taking pre-emptive action & repelling terrorists’ attempt to destabilise peace & tranquility in the region.”
Minister for Power, Coal, Renewable Energy and Mines Piyush Goyal said: “Congratulations to the Indian Army for #SurgicalStrikes to safeguard our nation. We are committed to fighting against terror in the region.”
Minister for Law and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “Surgical strikes were conducted when Pakistan didn’t mend ways after repeated diplomatic efforts 2 check terrorism originating frm their soil."

TWO Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists, who were arrested by National Investigation Agency in connection with terror attack on an army camp in Uri, were remanded to a 15-day judicial custody by the Special Judge for NIA cases, Kishore Kumar, in Srinagar on Friday.
Faisal Hussain Awan, 20 and Ahsan Khursheed, 19, belonged to village Podha Jhandgra and Khaliana Khurd village, respectively, in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).
Pointing out that the accused have been arrested in a case registered at Police Station NIA, New Delhi, for the offences under sections 203, 307, 124(A) and 120-B, 121 and 121-A of the Ranbir Penal Code, besides provisions of Arms Act and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the judge observed that perusal of case diary file reveals that they are members of the Pakistan based terrorist organization JeM and they had been working for waging war against India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Accepting the NIA plea that investigations in the case are at its initial stage and their custodial interrogation is needed to unearth a larger conspiracy hatched by JeM and its over ground supporters against the nation, the judge remanded both the arrested terrorists to 15 days judicial custody up to October 21. The court directed the NIA to get medical examination of the accused conducted as required under law.
Both the terrorists were arrested by NIA in connection with terror attack on an army camp in Uri in which 19 Army personnel were killed on September 18 this year."

On September 18, at the break of dawn, 19 Indian Army soldiers were killed and several others injured after a brazen attack at an army base camp in Uri, Kashmir. The armed militants lobbed grenades into their tents and barracks, while the soldiers were sleeping. The ensuing fire led to a large number of casualties. Twenty-eight injured soldiers are being treated at a military hospital. The preliminary investigations into the incident revealed that Pakistan-based organisation Jaish-e-mohammad was behind the attacks.
The terrorist attacks garnered widespread criticism and condemnation from leaders and public figures from all around the world. Immediately after the incident, PM Narendra Modi sent out a tweet saying that that those behind the attacks will not be spared.

PM Modi’s first response to the attackhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We strongly condemn the cowardly terror attack in Uri. I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished,” Modi’s tweet said.
The Prime Minister also offered condolences to the families of soldiers who lost their lives. “We salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,” he tweeted.
He also wrote on the actions initially taken by the government after the terrorist action. His tweet said, “Have spoken to HM (Home Minister Rajnath Singh) & RM (Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar) on the situation. RM will go to J&K himself to take stock of the situation.”
Modi’s speech in Kerala
Narendra Modi went to Kozhikode in Kerala on 21st to attend the BJP council meet over Uri incident. Yesterday, PM Modi gave his first public speech after the incident and slammed Pakistan for its refusal to take actions against those responsible.
Addressing the BJP national conclave in Kozhikode, PM Modi said, “There is only one country in Asia that indulges in terrorism and exporting it around the world. Terrorism is humanity’s enemy and India will never forget the 18 martyred soldiers who were killed by terrorists in Uri.”
The Prime Minister said India had never bowed to terror and will never do so in future and will strive to defeat it. “Be it Afghanistan, Bangladesh or other nations, we have seen whenever the news of terror incidents comes, terrorists have either gone from this country (Pakistan) or have settled there after committing the crime,” he said.
PM Modi also slammed Pakistan saying that the country cannot handle PoK, Gilgit and Balochistan, which are already under it’s control. “A day will come when people of Pakistan will go against its own government to fight terrorism,” he added.
He also directly appealed to Pakistani citizens saying that India was ready to fight for them if they have the strength to join the fight against poverty. “I call upon people of Pakistan to come forward,fight a war on who defeats unemployment, poverty, illiteracy first. Lets see who wins?” he said.
PM Modi’s Mann Ki Baat address
On Sunday, PM addressed the nation in his monthly radio broadcast programme Mann Ki Baat, which airs at All India Radio. PM again started his speech by saying that Uri attackers will not be spared.  “I pay my tribute to soldiers who lost their lives in Uri terror attack. The culprits will be punished for sure,” he said.
PM Modi also said that he has full confidence in Indian Army and are proud of them. He talked about a youth who
Modi talked about a youth, a class 11 student, named Harshvardhan, who wrote to him talking about his will to serve the nation after Uri attack.
While addressing Kashmiris in his address, Modi said that people from Kashmir are now getting aware regarding who are the anti-national elements.
The Uri attack was one of the most devastating terror attacks in the country in recent times. On Sunday, another soldier, an Odia BSF jawan succumbed to his injuries, increasing the death toll to 19."

(Source: AP)
References to Kashmir and tensions arising out of Uri terror attack were conspicuously absent in Chinese official media coverage of the meeting between China Premier Li Keqiang and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in New York. As all-weather strategic partners of cooperation, China and Pakistan have always firmly supported each other and their friendship is unbreakable, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Li as saying while meeting Sharif on the sidelines of UN General Assembly session.
China stands ready to deepen all-round practical cooperation with Pakistan and is willing to make joint efforts with Islamabad in injecting new impetus into the development of bilateral relations, Li said. While noting that practical cooperation focussing on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has made positive progress, Li urged the two sides to carry out the planned construction of the corridor, accelerate the building of the Gwadar Port as well as its supporting facility, and bring more companies into industrial parks, the report said.
China is willing to maintain close high-level contacts and continue to strengthen coordination with Pakistan on global and regional affairs, Li said. However, contrary to reports in Pakistan media, there were no references to Kashmir situation or Uri attack in Xinhua’s story on Li-Sharif meeting.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A report in Pakistani daily Dawn had said “Li had assured that China would continue to support Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir”. The Dawn report quoted Li as telling Sharif that: “We support Pakistan and we will speak for Pakistan at every forum.” China attached great importance to Pakistan’s position on Kashmir and said “Pakistan itself was a victim of terrorism”, it said.

The Chinese premier hoped that there would be better understanding of Pakistani position on Kashmir by the international community, the report had quoted Li as saying. Sharif showed his satisfaction on the state of Pak-China relations and welcomed the statement of China on the ‘atrocities’ being committed in Kashmir, the report had said.
Li expressed the hope that situation between India and Pakistan would not escalate. He said China was ready to play constructive role in improvement of relations between Pakistan and India. Xinhua quoted Sharif as telling Li that Pakistan and China are time-tested friends and partners who have firmly supported each other.
As their relations develop very smoothly, bilateral cooperation in a variety of fields has also entered a new phase. The Pakistani side cherishes friendship with China, and is committed to promoting bilateral cooperation, Sharif was quoted as saying."

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi huddled with the top brass in the government to discuss strategy in wake of Uri terror attack, NDA ally Shiv Sena took potshots at the government, while demanding “tit for tat” action against Pakistan.
“Nobody will accept our demand to isolate Pakistan at the international level. We have always been doing it at international level. Pakistan will also do such exercise. We had done the same thing when the terror attack had happened in Pathankot, we had done the same thing in past when Mumbai terror strike happened and when Parliament was attacked. This will entail no gain (Iska koi fayada hone waala nahin hai),”said Rajya Sabha MP and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.
Asked about the approach the government should follow, he said it should be “tit-for-tat”. When told that the government had decided to provide evidence to Pakistan about its involvement in the Uri attack, Raut said, “Evidence was also found in Pathankot attack. We had provided evidence after Pathankot attack, Parliament attack and 26/11 as well.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In a veiled dig at Modi government, Raut said, “Our language (in the run up to the 2014 elections) was if Pakistan kills one of our soldiers, we will kill 10. This was our language. That should be implemented.”

Top defence experts on Thursday termed the ‘surgical strikes’ on terror launch pads across the Line of Control in PoK as an “operational necessity” and said those were necessitated as the “levels of tolerance” were crossed. Former top guns of the military lauded the bravery and calibrated approach of the Indian security forces as also the government for allowing the military to carry out the task and said “a long pending debt has been paid back today”. They justified the strikes, saying the forces had entered into Indian territory occupied by Pakistan.

“I am very pleased that the government is letting the Army do what it needs to do. Let Pakistani military know that this is what we have done and we will continue to do it (if) they do not behave themselves. We need a big heart for doing this. We have to congratulate the intelligence sources for providing accurate information on whereabouts of militants. We need to compliment the government for giving a free hand to the military. So, obviously, government had given a clean action chit to the military who launched a surgical strike with good dividend,” former DG Infantry Lt Gen S Prasad said.
 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Noting that the forces adopted a “very calibrated approach” in their strikes, he said this is how the Indian government should react by leaving the military to do the job. Former RAW chief C D Sahay said the strikes had to happen and were “inescapable”, contending these should not be related to the Pathankot or Uri attacks as there has been a long history of trans-border infiltration. He lauded India for dealing with such matters with a mature approach while maintaining calm.

 
“The red lines have (been) crossed. The levels of tolerance have (been) crossed and this had to happen. I would congratulate them, but I would still urge (India) not to go gung-ho about it. It was an operational necessity. It was a security necessity. It had to be done. I would urge everyone to move on from here and not escalate (tensions) further,” he said.
India carried out ‘surgical strikes’ on terror launch pads across the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir last night, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists and those harbouring them. The announcement of the sudden action by the army was made on Thursday by DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, 11 days after a terror strike by Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM on an Indian army camp in Uri in Kashmir which left 18 soldiers dead. After the attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the attackers will not go “unpunished” and that the sacrifice of 18 jawans will not go in vain."

Joshua T. White is Associate Professor of the Practice of South Asia Studies and Fellow at the Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asia Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS. Till January 2017, he served at the Obama White House as Senior Advisor & Director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. He had served in the Pentagon Senior Advisor for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where he supported then Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter in advancing the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative. White spoke to SUSHANT SINGH about the India-Pakistan, Kashmir and the Indian expectations from the Trump administration.
Based on your experience in the Obama National Security Council till January this year, how do you read the current state of bilateral relations between India and Pakistan?
In a word, disheartening. There is plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the border. But it seems to me that the decisive factor in preventing rapprochement remains the unwillingness of the Pakistani military to countenance any meaningful efforts to normalize ties with India, or to substantially rein in those militant groups that threaten regional security. With a Pakistani general election slated for next year, I’m not optimistic that this dynamic is likely to change anytime soon.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Was the situation in Kashmir, starting from last year, a concern for the Obama administration? Did you advise the Modi government about it?
It was a concern. Precisely because the United States and India share a commitment to human rights and democratic values, we both felt free to speak up when we believed that the other side was not living up to its commitments.
I do think there’s some cause for introspection in India regarding the latest wave of tensions in Jammu and Kashmir. Like many of India’s friends here in the United States, I’ve been troubled by the public — and at times, official — support for the Indian army major who used a local man as a human shield. We know from our own history that these sorts of actions are, in the end, unproductive and not befitting a great and diverse country.
Were you guys taken by surprise by “surgical strikes” after the Uri terror attack? What was the extent of the “surgical strikes”, in your view?
In the immediate aftermath of Uri attack we very quickly established high-level consultations with New Delhi to offer our support, compare assessments, and urge a measure of restraint. I don’t want to say precisely what was discussed and when, but we certainly sympathized with the gravity and persistence of the cross-border threat that India faces. And we were gratified that the Indian government chose to communicate — rapidly and credibly — that its action was limited in nature.
My friends in India have focused quite a lot on teasing out the particulars of the government’s so-called ‘surgical strikes’. As they should. But I would hope that that doesn’t distract us from the more fundamental question, which is how New Delhi’s actions might be read as precedent and might change the nature of military escalation in the future. After Uri, Pakistan chose to deny that the Indian strikes had even taken place. That opened a welcome path for de-escalation. We can’t count on similar Pakistani restraint in the future; nor should the Indian public be overconfident and expect that a repeat of India’s playbook from Uri would necessarily produce as tidy and limited an outcome next time.
How strong were India’s complaints against Pakistan over cross-border terrorism, say after Pathankot or Gurdaspur? Is there any way in which you guys were able to impress upon Pakistan to act against India-centric terror groups? What more could have been done?
We heard the Indian concerns loud and clear. And candidly, there was real sympathy at the highest levels of the U.S. government for the threat that India faces from cross-border terrorism. All people of good faith should find it appalling that groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Muhammad, and their front organizations operate, fundraise, and even conduct rallies openly in Pakistan. It’s an affront to UN resolutions, and a dereliction of Pakistan’s own public commitments not to discriminate between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ militants.
I have to believe that there are occasions in which Pakistan might quietly constrain the militant operations of these groups. But it’s clear that the government has done little to dismantle their infrastructure or limit their public profile and legitimacy.
You know as well as I do that the United States has not been able to meaningfully shift Pakistan’s calculus with respect to these organizations. India tends to overestimate American leverage, and underestimate the risks that the United States would incur were we to rupture our relationship with Pakistan. But even if we were willing to accept much greater risk to that relationship, it’s simply very difficult to compel a country to change a policy that it adheres to for ideological or strategic reasons.
If there is a silver lining there, it is that I see a growing recognition both inside and outside of Pakistan that the activities of these groups could increasingly complicate even Pakistan’s closest relationships, and could threaten its standing in the global financial system. You’re beginning to see this with the serious efforts by the Financial Action Task Force to insist that Pakistan constrain funding of India-focused militant groups, or face real financial effects in the global market.
Trump administration remains an unknown quantity in South Asia. What would you advise the officials here who are still groping in the dark about his policies?
From what I understand, President Trump takes a generally positive view of India. I think he appreciates India’s economic vitality, strategic potential, and the close cultural ties that our countries have forged. That said, his engagements with foreign counterparts tend to be rather transactional; he’s always looking for ‘the deal’.
This presents something of a challenge for India. Unlike Japan, India isn’t in a position to mobilize capital to support infrastructure investment or job creation in America on a wide scale. Unlike China, India doesn’t have leverage — real or perceived — over a top-tier national security challenge like North Korea. And the tensions over immigration, education visas in the United States, and climate policy are bound to persist as sources of tension.
With this as a backdrop, by advice would be three-fold. First, focus on building a strong personal relationship with the President. As I saw first-hand in staffing and advising President Obama, this takes times. It takes phone calls. It takes reaching out on a regular basis to compare notes on global issues, not just parochial ones. I’m hopeful that the leaders’ meeting, which we anticipate will take place later in June, will be a venue for kicking off this kind of rapport.
Second, India needs to think seriously and creatively about areas in which it can offer increased access to its markets for U.S. firms. I’m not suggesting that it should do so unilaterally or altruistically, but unless U.S. companies feel like there is some movement on this front, it’s hard to see the Trump administration sustaining a high level of energy on the India relationship.
Third and finally, both countries should work toward building a collaborative response to China’s growing influence across Asia. This isn’t to say that the goal should be containment. But there should be candid, practical discussions about how to align our economic and security policies in the Indo-Pacific, and ensure more broadly that countries across Asia are not unduly swayed by their acceptance of Chinese investment. Making this kind of collaboration work depends critically on two things: a decision by the United States to move toward a more realistic and stable China policy that recognizes China as a strategic competitor and avoids subsuming the Sino-American relationship to any single issue such as North Korea; and a commitment to sustain high-level investment in the U.S.-India-Japan dialogue, which has emerged over the last several years as one of the most promising new developments in the Asian political architecture.
What was the difference in your own dealings between the UPA government under Dr Manmohan Singh and the BJP govt under Modi?
I think that one of Prime Minister Modi’s most consequential foreign policy accomplishments has been his ability to redefine India’s big tent diplomacy in such a way as to substantially deepen collaboration with the United States while preserving India’s strikingly independent approach to global affairs.
I’ve watched this most closely on security issues. I started working on our defense trade relationship with India under then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter back in 2012, at a time when ‘DTI’ had only one ’T’ and we bickered about whether that letter stood for ‘trade’ or ‘technology’. Even as the Defense Department took huge strides during that period in approving the release of sensitive technologies to India, the defense relationship felt rather one-sided. The UPA government was exasperatingly cautious on defense issues.
The BJP government has been a much more ambitious partner. The fact that our governments can now openly discuss collaboration in sensitive areas such as anti-submarine warfare would have been inconceivable only a few years ago. Our defense trade relationship has flourished. And our counterterrorism and intelligence conversations have matured significantly.
All of that is welcome. But my own instinct is that we can go considerably further together without India being at risk of sacrificing its autonomy. In some domains, the Indian government is still quite cautious. From the American vantage point, it is a strange partnership indeed in which India expects to receive some of our most sensitive military technologies, but resists engaging in basic joint naval patrols, or reacts with deep suspicion to cooperative defense activities.
As you know, it took over ten years to finalize a very basic logistics agreement. Our Defense Department usually negotiates these at the level of a lieutenant colonel, but when it came to India these negotiations went to the highest political levels, and the text was finalized only minutes before Prime Minister Modi walked into the Oval Office.
I’d like to hope that one of the fruits of Modi’s more vigorous engagement with the United States has been that the Indian public — and the bureaucracy — increasingly recognize that the United States genuinely wants to build a broad partnership with India, and that it is not demanding exclusivity or any entangling commitments that are inconsistent with India’s broad base of global relationships.
Have the India-US relations reached their full potential? If not, why not? What more needs to be done?
Not by a long shot. I wouldn’t bet against the U.S.-India relationship, in part because India is itself acting more assertively on the world stage. It was not lost on the Obama administration that India was playing a progressively more constructive role in shaping global issues and outcomes — e.g., on climate, internet governance, and global maritime norms. Even though there were real challenges in other domains, such as at the WTO, we were acutely aware of India’s rising prominence in shaping the global debate.
Clearly, the Trump administration takes a dimmer view of some of these global institutions and norms. All the same, I think that India can find areas in which to demonstrate its leadership bona fides on a global stage on issues that President Trump cares about — bolstering counter-terrorism cooperation, shaping the rise of China, and being a ‘burden-sharing’ security provider in the Indo-Pacific."

The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s ultimatum to Pakistani actors to leave the country, following the Uri terror attack that claimed the lives of 19 jawans, received usual criticism as the organisation is known for using such incidents for its political benefit. Many open letters and Facebook posts were written in favour of Pakistani artistes suggesting art and culture know no boundaries and that the creative people should be kept away from Indo-Pak rivalry. After all, what does a “common man have to do with all this”.
Karan Johar, whose upcoming film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil features Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, said in a TV interview that if banning actors solve terrorism then “we must go ahead with it”. However, there were some dissenting voices who questioned the silence of these artistes on series of terror attacks on Indian soil sponsored by authorities from their country.


Watch | What Fawad Khan Had to Say About India And Its Hospitality Months Backhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png




Karan was actually right in saying that banning actors will not solve terrorism. But there is a larger picture which Karan and many like him either don’t understand or intentionally try to ignore. Actors are part of the big entertainment industry which has a huge commercial worth and is a source of employment to many. And if reports are to be believed, the Pakistani film industry fears to suffer a 70 per cent business loss if Indo-Pak ties worsen and Bollywood films are banned in the country. Many Pakistani distributors believe if Indian films are not released there, cinema owners might have to completely wrap up their business or shut a few screens to cut costs. Consider the huge amount the likes of Fawad Khan and other actors and singers are paid to perform in India. It will be a huge setback for them if they lose work here.
It’s almost clear that the Indian government will go for non-military actions to avenge the Uri attack. It has asserted that it will make all efforts to isolate Pakistan. Isolation means India will do international campaigns to give Pakistan a global recognition of a terrorist state and urge world nations to snap all ties and impose economic sanction on it. India is also considering revoking the Indus Water Treaty which will leave Pakistan high and dry in the literal sense.
If all these steps come into effect, more than the Pakistani forces, which are behind most of the terror attacks in India, the common man of Pakistan will suffer. So should the government consider the pain of a common man in Pakistan and forget the killing of Indian soldiers? I think the answer to this should be left for interpretation of the global happenings.
Strengthening the voice of common man is must for a strong democracy. Artistes too are common people and they must raise their voice at the time of crisis. But, unfortunately, Pakistani actors have chosen to remain silent on Indian tragedy and interestingly found spokespersons in their Indian counterparts. An unfavourable appointment at a film institution in India meets with countrywide opposition. The film fraternity unites to oppose decisions of the Censor Board when they threaten their creative freedom. That is Indian democracy. May be it is the time to make Pakistan feel the heat in a similar way so that they can come out of their comfort zone and speak.
It’s true that the contribution of Pakistani artistes in the Indian film industry cannot be undermined.

BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma on Wednesday said that those seeking proof of the Indian Army’s surgical strikes in PoK were like people who insist on “watching the video of their parents’ wedding night before accepting someone as father”.
Referring to the remarks by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on the surgical strikes, the BJP legislator said, “Be it Kejriwal or Nirupam, whoever, irrespective of political affiliation, insults the Army or does not have faith in it and demands proof is like an individual who insists on watching the video of his parents’ suhaag raat before accepting someone as his father.’’

The Huzur MLA went on to say that those seeking proof from soldiers who shed their blood for the country were “traitors or Pakistani agents speaking the language of Nawaz Sharif”.
“When soldiers make the supreme sacrifice, why should they not get their due? Why should someone insult them,’’ he told The Indian Express when asked about his comments.
“I did not mean to insult Kejriwal or others, but only voiced my feelings,’’ he said, adding that the BJP has not asked him to apologise or warned him following his remark.
Sharma is not new to controversies. Two years ago, he linked “love jihad” to garba and asked the Bhopal district administration to ask garba organisers to insist on identity cards and allow non-Hindu men only if they give an affidavit that they have faith in Hinduism and its gods.

Enraged over the terror attack on an army battalion in Uri, former army officials on Sunday sought urgent action against Pakistan, including keeping the “military option open” to deal with terror from its soil.
“We must have our military option open, if required to strike at certain places,” Lt Gen (Retd) B S Jaswal said.
“Bring pickets, which have launch pad to the ground, raze them to the ground. The reason is that till the time it does not hurt Pakistan physically, they would not our decency,” Jaswal, who was GOC-in-C of the Northern Command, said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Pakistan keeps doing it (terror strikes) again and again knowing that we would not take any action,” Major (Retd) Gaurav Arya, who has expertise in Jammu and Kashmir security situation, said.

The problems in Kashmir are “systematically manufactured” at the GHQ in Rawalpindi, he alleged, adding “We must take immediate action. Stop trade with Pakistan, downgrade (its) Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. The world must know we are serious.”
Questioning the absence of two service chiefs at the meeting chaired by Home Minister Rajnath Singh to take stock of the situation after the attack, former army chief Gen Gen Shankar Roy Chowdhury said these actions were coming from Pakistan.
“We have this meeting chaired by No 2 in the Government, that is the Home Minister, where the RAW chief and CRPF chief are present. Who is doing these actions (terror attacks)? It is coming from across the border, from Pakistan,” he said.
“Is the CRPF chief going to look at Pakistan? Where are the Chief of Army and Chief of Naval Staff? Why they were not available to give (advice on) strategic action to the Government,” he asked.

Retired Brig Anil Gupta accused Pakistan of causing instability in the Valley.
He said the attack was “a matter of serious concern for India and is a desperate attempt by Pakistan to ensure the current turmoil in Kashmir doesn’t end.”
“Pakistan, despite all the criticism and the problems its facing, is hell bent on encouraging terrorism inside Kashmir,” Gupta said.
Commenting on the attack, Lt Gen (Retd) Syed Ata Hasnain said “preventing suicide attack is difficult, but damage control is always possible.”
In a series of tweets, the former GOC 15 and 21 Corps said such attacks were “a different type of warfare. Understand its nuances. (There is) No fool proof guarantee anywhere. The main danger is of suicide bombing not witnessed since 2004.”
Hasnain said “Be clear, warnings do not matter in this. A determined small group can get through. Never 100 per cent proofing against it.”
In the same vein, Lt Gen (Retd) K J Singh, who retired in July as Western Army Commander, said “No defences are fool proof”, though we aim to make it so but the essence is reaction."

Fawad Khan was an established Pakistani actor when he landed in Bollywood. With three films, he managed to make a name in India and soon got a dedicated fan following. Post the Uri attacks and ban on Pakistani actors, Fawad returned to Pakistan but says regard for his friends in Mumbai continues. In an interview to Dawn, the actor speaks about films, friends and controversies.
The actor, however, had his mind on fatherhood. He feels that the most important thing for him right now is his newborn daughter. “We’ve just had a baby and she takes up most of my time, and I’m finally getting to spend quality time with my family,” feels Fawad.

Fawad Khan feels that if he had not experienced the downs in life, he wouldn’t be able to appreciate the highs and his life will plateau. The actor totally feels that one needs to get a reality check from time to time. “Whatever that dark period was, I’m glad for it. Yeah, I’ve been penniless. I’ve had to struggle a bit. But now I enjoy thinking about that because it just makes me feel better about my achievements,” said Fawad in the interview.

When Fawad was asked about how the ban affected his friendship with Indian artistes, he said, “I’m still in touch with a lot of my friends there. Nothing’s really changed. Obviously, I’m not a man of steel in that people’s words don’t affect me. They might hurt me. But I am becoming immune to it as time goes by. I have no expectations from them, and that’s what I think has developed this camaraderie. Even if I don’t work with them ever again, I’ll still always have love and regard for them, and I assume that’s how they feel as well. That’s why we’re still in touch. We even make plans to meet, to catch-up.”

On what Fawad gained as an actor from his work in Bollywood, he said, “In Bollywood, they’ve got their systems in place. It’s a monster machine that’s churning out like 400 films a year, consistently. They’re able to efficiently process things. For example, when I was on the set of Khoobsurat, there would be a team of auditors who’d be analysing the cost of each day. Seeing it practically kind of reinforces your belief that planning is very important. There are a few producers who are doing that here and it’s encouraging to see that. But other than that, if you talk about acting, I think I’ve learned as much there as I have here [Pakistan].”"

Massive protests were held in Jammu today against the terrorist attack on an army base in North Kashmir’s Uri town in which 18 soldiers were killed with protestors burning Pakistani flags and its effigies. College and university students, lawyers, political parties, traders and various other organisations took out separate protest rallies in solidarity with the army and against the Pakistan for “aiding and abetting terrorism”.
Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) activists took out a rally from the Press Club area of the city and held protest demonstrations amid anti-Pakistan slogans. They also burnt down the effigy of Pakistan and demanded the country should be declared as “terrorist state”. “We demand that Pakistan should be declared as a terrorist state. Pakistan and its militants are attacking security forces and creating unrest in Kashmir. They are responsible for terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir,” said JKNPP Chairman Harsh Dev Singh.
Dubbing the neighbouring country as a “threat to the peace in South Asian region”, JKNNP leader castigated Pakistan for pushing fidayeens’ to carry out terror attacks on the security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir, besides “endorsing support to secessionists in the Valley”. Singh lambasted Pakistan for its “malicious and mischievous” designs in sponsoring militant attacks on defence installions in the state and abetting terror attacks cross the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Condemning the attack on the Army Brigade headquarters in Uri, he accused Pakistan for “pushing militants into our territory to vitiate peace and harmony in the state and the country”. The JKNPP leader said Pakistan’s “notoriety” had now assumed “alarming proportions” as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had on the eve of Eid announced “to continue its support to secessionists and other disruptive forces in Kashmir”. Singh said the statement was followed by the most “cowardly and deadliest” terror attack on the Indian Army in last two decades and unveiled the “nefarious designs of the belligerent neighbour to destabilise India”.
He alleged Pakistan has not been “mending ways” despite repeated warnings at appropriate forums and held the “rogue country responsible for the ongoing mayhem in Kashmir which had left thousands of security personnel injured”. Singh said it was high time that India should launch a “full throttle campaign” against Pakistan at international level for latter’s interference in India’s internal matters."

Mahira Khan will not be replaced in Raees despite a ban on Pakistani actors enforced by MNS. According to reports, the makers of the Shah Rukh Khan film will go ahead with Mahira and shoot her remaining scenes at an “undisclosed” location. They think replacing her is not a cost-efficient option. Raees producers Ritesh Sidhwani, Farhan Akhtar and SRK and director Rahul Dholakia are all optimistic that by the time the film releases in January, things will cool down.
Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan are among the other Pakistani actors, who have been banned from working in Bollywood in the aftermath of the Uri attack. While Fawad returned to Lahore, his upcoming film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil got stuck in major trouble ahead of its Diwali release. Much has happened in the past one month around the controversy. MNS chief Raj Thackeray met ADHM director Karan Johar on Saturday and lifted the ban on the release of the KJo film. However, his demand about banning the Pakistani artistes continues.Considering Mahira’s

Considering Mahira’s Raees is already on the verge of completing Raees, with only few opening scenes between her and actor SRK left to be filmed, the producers took the decision on practical grounds. While Shah Rukh can shoot the remaining portions in Mumbai, it is now impossible to get Mahira in India for the same. According to speculations, the entire unit will fly to Abu Dhabi where they will recreate the Mumbai set.

Raees is Mahira’s Bollywood debut. She has already shot for over 20 days with SRK at various locations before the controversy broke. Considering the story involves her character from 18-year-old teenager to a 35-year-old woman, it would be really difficult for the producers to find a quick replacement who would fit the bill. Hence, they have decided to retain Mahira and shoot her scenes abroad."

Flying officer Nirmal Jit Sekhon single-handedly defended the Srinagar air base against an attack by the Pakistan air force during the 1971 war. He is the only member of the IAF to have received the Param Vir Chakra (PVC). Havildar Abdul Hamid also received the PVC for his service during the 1965 war. He took out three Pakistani army Patton tanks, with his gun mounted on a jeep, before he was killed by a fourth. Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla went down with his ship, the INS Khukri, in the 1971 war, saving the lives of many of his crew in the process. All three men were honoured for their bravery and their sacrifice. Officially, the armed forces refer to their deceased as battle casualties, “killed in action” and in more sombre moments as simply “the fallen”. Nirmal Jit Sekhon, Abdul Hamid and Mahendra Nath Mulla did not die for their religion. They died doing their duty for their country
Martyr is not the traditional or official term for professional soldiers killed in uniform or civilian victims of terrorist attacks. Yet recently, most notably after the Uri attack, the media, government and even ordinary people have increasingly begun to use the locution for deceased soldiers and, at times, even civilian victims of terror. The misuse of a word as powerful as that is not merely a semantic error — it is also a kind of moral sleight-of-hand that allows the powers that be to obfuscate the complexity of the world we live in and their own negligence in the tragedy of innocent lives lost.
The origins, and even contemporary relevance, of the idea of martyrdom lie in religion. Literally from the Greek word meaning “witness”, martyrs have special significance in Christianity, Islam and Sikhism. Jesus Christ bore witness to his belief and willingly and consciously died for them and the sins of his followers for all time to come. In Shia Islam, the idea of martyrdom is at its strongest — Hussain dies for what he believes when he is slaughtered with his family at Karbala. Such is the injustice he suffers at the hands of Yazid that at the time of his martyrdom, Hussain inverts the traditional paradigm of the martyr — he does not just bear witness to god’s word and will; he asks god to witness his suffering. In Sikhism, the idea of shaheedi is a powerful one. Guru Arjan, Guru Tegh Bahadur and the sons of Guru Gobind Singh all died willingly for their beliefs. Most recently, and prominently, the religious idea has suited political ends — fundamentalist jihadists invoke it while searching for a moral justification for their nihilistic acts of violence. In North Korea, the idea of sacrifice for ideology, the state and the Communist revolution is prevalent. Nationalisms and struggles for freedom have invoked it as a tool for self-motivation in the face of insurmountable odds.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The thing that unites them all, diverse beliefs aside, is the idea of will and sacrifice. Martyrs, whatever else they may be, take a conscious decision to die. Their death becomes a call to action — whether for the legions of a religion or the citizens of a state — and an example. And it is precisely
because the idea is so powerful that we must be careful about how it is deployed. Are civilians killed in terrorist attacks, or the soldiers who died in their tents just days after they arrived in Uri martyrs? Were their deaths a wilful act on their part? By seemingly elevating them in designating them as martyrs, we are doing the victims of the Uri attack a great disservice.
In the media, the word gained wide currency first during the Kargil conflict. Just as the widespread use of the printing press — and thereby newspapers and journals — fuelled the creation of “imagined communities” and nationalism (famously articulated by Benedict Anderson) during the 18th and 19th century, satellite television and 24/7 news helped create television nationalism whose most vituperative mutation we can see dominating much of prime time news today. By implying wilful sacrifice on the part of those slain at Uri, we are not asking the difficult questions surrounding their death, at least not as widely and forcefully as we should be. And there are always those who would rather not answer.
The families and loved ones of the fallen at Uri are understandably angry and grief-stricken, just as any of us would be if our sons or brothers or fathers or friends were taken from us. But just as the state, tempered by reason and the law, prosecutes the perpetrators of heinous crimes rather than the families of the victims, we ought to ask the tough questions for those who no longer have a voice.
So many of those that died at Uri came from poverty. Among the dead were seven cooks. Did they choose to die the way they did, or were they victims of an event in which they had not authorship? Why were the tents, in which many of those who fell at Uri were residing, not fire retardant? Or why, as Sepoy Biswajit Ghorai’s father asked, was a 22-year-old with just 26 months in the army sent to such a high-risk zone so early in his career? So soon after Pathankot, why is one of our forward army bases so vulnerable to an attack from across the border? There may well be reasonable answers to all these questions. It is, however, our responsibility to ask them. And that is not a duty we can shirk by hiding under the shroud of a word."

The government at the highest level mulled its options in the wake of the Uri terror attack, with informed sources indicating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought a concerted global effort to diplomatically isolate Pakistan as an immediate step.
Modi, who chaired a meeting on Monday to review the situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of the attack that left 18 soldiers dead — one more soldier succumbed to his injuries in Delhi — wants clear evidence of Pakistan’s complicity to be presented to all major global fora, including the upcoming UN General Assembly, the sources indicated.
The meeting was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minster Manohar Parrikar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Army Chief Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag and other senior officials in the PMO, Defence Ministry and the Home Ministry.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The meeting is believed to have also considered several other options, the sources said, but these were likely to be measured and well thought-out.
At the meeting, the prime minister was also briefed about the use of “incendiary” ammunition by the terrorists, though such ammunition can be found only with army establishments, a source said. Such ammunition, experts believe, points to the backing the terrorists received from the Pakistan Army.

The sources said that Modi asked the security and other investigative agencies to collect all evidence that points to Pakistani involvement in the attack for presentation at international fora. The sources said the broad thinking was that India must act without getting into the trap of emotions and anger after taking into account both the short- and long-term implications.
Speaking to reporters separately, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said India was not concerned about Pakistani denials and reactions and will react appropriately and at its own pace. “Everything is in front of the people. We must not give much attention to Pakistan’s reaction. We will take our steps carefully,” Rijiju said.
Modi’s high-level meeting was held shortly after Rajnath Singh reviewed the situation along the border and the Line of Control (LoC) at a meeting with Home Ministry officials who were directed to coordinate with other border states like Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
Modi is under pressure to live up to his 2014 election campaign rhetoric of showing Pakistan that India is not a “soft power” and would give a “befitting reply” to any attacks on the country. Expectations of appropriate action were raised when Modi himself said soon after the attack: “I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished.”"

TWO Pakistanis arrested by the Army on charges of facilitating the attack on the 12 Infantry Brigade’s headquarters in Uri are Class 10 students who strayed across the Line of Control (LoC), the family of one and the principal of his school have told The Indian Express. The Ministry of External Affairs said the two had confessed to facilitating the “infiltration of a group of four Jaish-e-Muhammad cadre who carried out the Uri army camp attack.” Faisal Husain Awan, a resident of Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and his school-friend Ahsan Khursheed, from Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil, were arrested on September 21, three days after the attack which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers. Both these villages are an hour’s walk from the LoC near Uri.

Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum, Faisal Awan’s brother and a Lahore-based physician, says the two were at home on September 17, the date GPS data recovered from the terrorists by the National Investigation Agency and published by this newspaper last week, shows the Uri terrorists crossing the Line of Control.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I don’t want any controversy or recrimination,” says Tabassum, “which is why I hadn’t contacted the media. I am his older brother, and I am supposed to protect him. I do not know what to do. I can only hope someone powerful in India reads our story and sends these boys home.”
Basharat Husain, the principal of the the Shaheen Model School in Muzaffarabad, said Awan was a science student who had just graduated from Class IX with a first division.
The official marks-sheet shows Awan secured 328 out of a possible 525. Husain described Awan as “a model student, respectful and friendly.”
“For the six hours he was in school each day,” Basharat Husain said, “his behaviour was exemplary.”
Both boys, according to school documents provided by Husain, were 16 years old which — if these documents are authentic — makes them juveniles under Indian law and entitled to special protections, irrespective of their nationality.
“I did not know the two were friends,” Husain said, “but it is not surprising, given that they were in the same school, and from similar backgrounds.”
The Army, which on September 24 said the two were “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir nationals who have been working for Jaish-e-Muhammad terror outfit” said, in an e-mail response to the The Indian Express, that this determination was based on what it described as “spot interrogation.” However, the e-mail did not answer whether the Army had obtained the ages of the two while arresting them. The Army referred this newspaper to the NIA.
An NIA spokesperson said the agency “is in the process of analysing the available evidence in the case before we submit the Final Report to the court.” He said “the age (of) the two arrested persons was recorded as per statements given by them after their arrest,” but did not specifically state if they were known to minors.
However, sources said that no evidence had been found to support the contention that the two were linked, in any way, to the Uri attack.
The attack, significantly, has since been attributed to the Lashkar-e-Taiba — not, as initially claimed, the Jaish-e-Muhammad — with the Muridke-based terrorist group holding funeral rites for one of the attackers. NIA sources also told this newspaper that cipher-matrixes recovered from the attackers tallied with those used in other Lashkar attacks.
The two, NIA sources said, offered several varying accounts to interrogators, one to a woman doctor working for the Central Reserve Police Force that they had participated in the attack itself, providing details of how incendiary substances were used to set the tents at the 12 Brigade on fire. In an October 3 statement, the NIA claimed Awan identified one of the four slain terrorists who attacked the 12 Brigade headquarters as Hafiz Ahmad, who he said was the son of Feroze, in the village of Dharbang, west of Murree.
“Further interrogation of the two men is being done,” the NIA said. New Delhi had accused the two teenagers of participating in the attack in a dossier handed over to Pakistan’s High Commissioner in New Delhi Abdul Basit.
Zeero Begum, Faisal Awan’s mother, has been in shock since news of his arrest broke, Tabassum said. “She wakes up suddenly, crying and asking us to find out how he is. She imagines what he must be going through; how he must be; what he is eating; if he is sleeping. It is very hard on her, because Faisal, being the youngest in the family, is loved the most.”
Gul Akbar, Awan’s father, was a carpenter, but is now too aged to work, Tabassum said. Ahsan Khurshid’s mother, Tabassum said, has not spoken at all since she learned of his arrest. His father, a cook, works in Saudi Arabia.
The Indian Express tracked down Awan’s family using records he provided to Indian investigators to locate his brother in Lahore. The interviews were conducted both in person, and through voice-over-internet services.
Distraught, Tabassum, a graduate of a medical school in Cuba where he studied on a Pakistan government scholarship, has spent most of the past two months attempting without success to piece together how his younger brother ended up in an Indian jail at the end of his visit home for the Eid-ul-Adha holidays.
Faisal Awan, Tabassum says, had elected not to go to school on September 20, waking up late. In the afternoon, he says, Awan decided to head to the nearby Pir Kanth shrine. The boys, he says, may have lost their way while attempting to take a shortcut, and ended up across the Line of Control.
“The family began to panic when he did not return by the time of the maghrib namaaz,” he says, “because he had never once spent a night out of the house before, except with relatives. That night, we looked all over the neighbourhood, but there was no sign of him.”
Potha Jandgran, Faisal Awan’s home village, is on an earth road leading out from the village of Chhatter, half an hour’s drive south of Muzaffarabad. The family thought the boy might have headed to Rawalpindi, where they have family, and then filed a police complaint in Muzaffarabad on September 22.
There was similar consternation in Ahsan Khurshid’s village, in the jurisdiction of Chinari police station, half an hour’s drive from the Kaman Post, which marks the Line of Control in Uri — and just as little success in locating the boy.
Assistant Sub-Inspector Riaz Husain, of the Sadar Police Station in Muzaffarabad, said the families reported the boys had gone for a picnic, after missing a scheduled school trip to Murree. Though relatively rare, accidental crossings of the LoC are not unknown: over a dozen cases have been reported in the last five years, Jammu and Kashmir Police records show. Local residents near Uri who apprehended the two students on September 20 told The Indian Express they initially denied any wrongdoing, claiming, while being roughed-up by villagers, that they had strayed across the LoC."

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has been asked to probe the attack on the Langate camp of the Army’s 30 Rashtriya Rifles battalion, where three militants were killed when they tried to enter the camp on Thursday. A team of NIA officials visited Langate and Handwara areas on Friday to take over the case.
The agency is already investigating the Uri attack in which 19 armymen were killed.
A senior police officer confirmed to the The Indian Express that NIA will be probing the case.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said that the NIA officials will inspect all the items recovered from the militants. These included three AK rifles, three under-barrel grenade launchers, magazines, four walkie-talkie sets, medicines and cash.
Officials said that the agency is expected to probe the case on the lines of the Uri attack case as foreign militants were involved.
Meanwhile, the Army Friday conducted search operations in some villages in Langate, but nobody was arrested. The Army fears that one of the militants managed to escape during the encounter, taking advantage of the darkness.
The Army has also launched a search operation in the forests of Nowgam close to the LoC. The Army claimed on Thursday that it foiled two infiltration bids in the area and killed four militants. Army officials said more militants could be hiding in the area."

Actors came out in support of Karan Johar and his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil that is currently facing a ban after the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India requested its members to suspend the release of the film keeping in mind the anti-Pakistan wave that is currently running in the country post the Uri attacks.
B-town is supporting a beleaguered Karan Johar and said it is unfair to punish an Indian filmmaker for shooting with a Pakistani actor while the relationship between India and Pakistan was healthy.
Speaking at Filmfare Glamour & Style Awards 2016, Alia Bhatt said, “I have seen bits of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and found it beautiful. It’s a beautiful emotional film. As a proud resident of this country and as a privileged member of the industry, I feel whatever is happening with the film at this point is unfair because when the film was shot a year back the climate was nice. But the current climate I know how it is but when it was shot the climate was good. I don’t want to say anything more. I have given you my answer.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another actor close to Karan Johar, Sidharth Malhotra, too batted for his mentor’s film. Said Sidharth, “As an actor, I don’t think it is fair to a filmmaker. This picture was made a year back and political scenario then was different. I have worked with the actor in question (Fawad). It is not fair to a filmmaker who is making a love story which has nothing to do with the political scenario. We are also not stopping any other ties with that country but only movies. So as a part of the fraternity, I hope we have a wonderful release and it is a wonderful story that people get to see made by Karan Johar.”
Sushant Singh Rajput who is yet to work with Karan Johar too threw his weight behind the filmmaker. Said Sushant, “I admire Ranbir as an actor. I love Karan Johar’s films and I have loved the trailer. If given a chance on the first day I will go and watch the film.”"

Indicating action against Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said ‘blood & water can’t flow together at the same time’ in meeting with Water ministry officials on Indus Waters treaty.
Held amidst heightened tension between the India and Pakistan, the meeting also decided to set up a inter-ministerial task forces to go into the details and working of the Treaty with a “sense of urgency”, senior government sources said.
Attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, the Water Resources Secretary, and senior PMO officials, the meeting also noted that the meeting of Indus Water Commission can “only take place in atmosphere free of terror”. The Commission has held 112 meetings so far.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“Prime Minister’s Modi’s message at the meeting was that ‘rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta’ (blood and water cannot flow together),” sources said.
Apart from deciding to exploit to the maximum the capacity of three of the rivers that are under Pakistan’s control – Indus, Chenab and Jhelum– in the areas of hydro power, irrigation and storage, the meeting also agreed to review the “unilateral suspension” of Tulbul navigation project in 1987.
The sources asserted that the decision to maximise the water resources for irrigation will address the “pre-existing” sentiment of people of Jammu and Kashmir, who have complained in the past about the treaty not being fair to them.
The meeting came as India weighed its options to hit back at Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri attack that left 18 soldiers dead, triggering demands that the government scrap the water distribution pact to mount pressure on that country.

Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, water of six rivers – Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum – were to be shared between the two countries.
Pakistan has been complaining about not receiving enough water and gone for international arbitration in a couple of cases.
India-Pakistan relations took a hit after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July, and even more so after the terrorist attack on Uri base in Jammu and Kashmir by Jaish-e-Mohammed militants that killed 19 soldiers. Last week, External Affairs Ministry Spokesman Vikas Swarup had told the media that “for any such treaty to work, you need mutual trust and goodwill. I will leave it at that”.
Responding to a question from the media, Swarup had said last week that “it cannot be a one-sided affair”, adding that the government will rethink on the Treaty given the growing strain between the two countries. He also noted that the preamble of the Treaty itself said it was based on “goodwill”.
India’s assertion came amid calls that the government should scrap the water distribution pact to mount pressure on Pakistan in the aftermath of the audacious Uri terror attack."

Pakistan on Friday denied claims regarding killing of any Pakistan soldier by India at the International Border in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir. In a statement issued today, General Asim Bajwa, Director General, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the Indian Army’s claim of hitting or killing any Pakistan soldier/Ranger with firing at anytime today at LOC/ working boundary are absolutely false. The Pakistan official went on to say that India resorted to unprovoked firing which was dealt by Pakistan soldiers.

“Indians resorted to unprovoked firing in Shakargarh sector today. Pakistan Rangers befittingly responded to the attack. There have been no loss on Pakistan side,” said Bajwa in the statement.

A statement issued by BSF spokesperson earlier on Friday said that seven Pakistani Rangers were killed and three others were injured as BSF retaliated to mortar shelling and small arms fire from across the International Border at various places in Kathua, Samba and Jammua districts. “There is confirmed information of the killing of seven Pak Rangers and serious injury to three others,” a BSF spokesperson said.
According to reports, an Indian army soldier was also injured in the gun battler across LOC in Gali Maidan area of Sawjian sector, while a BSF jawan was injured in unprovoked firing by Pakistani rangers in Hiranagar sector along the international border in Kathua district on Friday.
In the aftermath of the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army along the LoC, there has been an escalation in ceasefire violation by Pakistan and terrorist attacks have taken place in several districts in Jammu and Kashmir. India conducted surgical strikes against the terrorist launch pads along the LoC in response to the Uri attack which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers. Pakistan had earlier also denied India’s claim of surgical strikes in Pakistan.

Appeals are being made on social media — even by the leaders of the ruling BJP in the state — asking people to boycott Chinese goods, especially during Diwali. BJP leaders are also advocating the use of “swadeshi”.
Leading the bandwagon is state’s Health Minister Anil Vij who has appealed to people not to use Chinese goods.
What what else is in the newshttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“People should not buy Chinese goods. Instead, Indian goods should be used. Trade with China is affecting our country. China is not our friend nation. China can buy weapons with whatever money it earns. There is a possibility that the weapons are given to enemy countries. For every dollar of purchase people make, they may make armed goods. We should focus on Make in India,” said Vij The Health Minister said there could be difficulties at the level of the government. “So, this needs to be a social movement and it is up to the people what they would do.”
The Haryana government has been busy wooing China for investment in the state. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, along with Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu, who then held the industries portfolio, had visited Beijing to attract investment. A total of eight MoUs were signed during the visit in January this year. An MoU was signed with Wanda Group, China’s real estate giant, for setting up an industrial township at Sonepat. Investors from China were also present during the Global Investors’
An appeal by BJP president Subhash Barala not to purchase Chinese goods is also doing the rounds on social media. Barala said he had stated this in reply to a question that was posed to him by someone.
“I was asked that since China is stopping water of Brahmaputra, so there is a discussion on boycotting Chinese goods. I said it is a good thing. We celebrated Gandhiji’s birthday yesterday and he gave stress on Swadeshi. If we adopt Swadeshi, a large number of people will get employment. On Diwali, if an earthen lamp is lit, the potters will benefit. Through use of Swadeshi, our foreign exchange will be saved. I used to be part of the Swadeshi Karyakarta Manch. I feel this issue should be looked at,” the BJP president said.
The use of Chinese lights and crackers during Diwali have over the years gained popularity among people, thus affecting the indigenous markets.
Rajkumar Saini, BJP’s MP in Kurukshetra, said if people start understanding that they should not buy products from outside, then the products of our own country will be encouraged. “Indian industry is being affected by Chinese goods. People should know that the products being sold here on cheap prices are sub-standard items. People are buying these goods as these are cheap. But later they face problems as there is no replacement or repair. If we purchase Indian goods, our youth will get employment,” said Saini.
Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said, “Customer is the king and can buy anything. No one can stop him. However, a feeling of Swadeshi will give a boost to our economy. Without any restrictions being imposed by the government, if the customers take this path, the economy will grow stronger.”
The opinion of the BJP leaders has, however, come under criticism from the leaders of the opposition.
Ashok Arora, the president of Indian National Lok Dal, says the leaders of the BJP make such statements only to divert attention of the people.
“If they talk of using swadeshi and boycotting Chinese goods, there could be a retaliation and other countries might decide not to use our products. Trade relations will be hampered. People can talk about such things, not the leaders,” said Arora."

Strongly reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks that Pakistan is the “mothership of terrorism”, Premier Nawaz Sharif’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz on Sunday accused the Indian leader of “misleading” the BRICS countries over the issue. “Mr Modi is misleading his BRICS and BIMSTEC colleagues,” Aziz said. He also alleged that the Indian leadership is “desperately trying to hide its brutalities” in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan Foreign Office (FO) said that Aziz reacted strongly to Modi’s statement during his address at the BRICS summit in Goa in which he called Pakistan a “mothership” of terrorism world-wide.

Aziz said the UN Human Rights High Commissioner in Geneva and the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have called for sending a fact finding mission to Kashmir. He said The UN and OIC have “rejected Indian attempts to equate Kashmiris’ movement for self-determination with terrorism.”

Amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after the terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, an Indian journalist was asked to leave a press conference scheduled to be addressed by Pakistan Foreign Secretary in New York on Monday.
The journalist employed with NDTV was reportedly told ‘to be removed’ from the room by Pakistani officials ahead of a press conference by Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry at Roosevelt Hotel in the city. The briefing was being organised on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) where both the nations are expected to raise the Kashmir and Balochistan issue.
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has already reached US and will address the Assembly on Wednesday. It is expected that Kashmir issue will dominate his speech at UNGA. However Sharif, when approached by another Indian journalist, refused to answer the question on the Uri attack.

As per the NDTV report, no Indian journalist was allowed to attend the press conference by Pakistan Foreign Secretary on Monday."

Asserting that the Indian armed forces are prepared to take on any challenge, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Arup Raha on Saturday said there has been enough discussion on the surgical strikes across the LoC, but the forces will not talk about it. “There has been so much discussion on this issue in the country; every section of society is giving opinion on this issue. … the armed forces are supposed to deliver the result that the nation expects. We are not going to talk about it; we will just deliver,” Air Chief Marshal Raha said at the Hindon air base on the 84th Air Force Day.
Raha is also the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Responding to a question on the surgical strikes and politicisation of the issue, Raha refused to comment on the Indian Army action across the Line of Control on the night of September 28-29 and related issues.
The surgical strikes had come in the wake of the September 18 terrorist attack on an army camp in Uri town of Jammu and Kashmir, in which 19 soldiers were killed. In his speech at the Air Force Day function earlier, Raha mentioned both Pathankot and Uri attacks in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir respectively.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Terrorist attacks at the Uri (army camp) and Pathankot (IAF) base show the troubled times we are living in,” Raha said. Asked to comment on the issue later, the Air Force chief said India is learning lessons every time something happens.
“We are getting smarter and smarter; we are learning lessons every time something happens. I think we are very well prepared now to face any such contingency,” he said. “The armed forces are well prepared to take on any sub-conventional threat. We have had one or two cases… a determined terrorist can always get the better of people but the aim is to prevent it… the deterrence. We should be able to detect any such attack right in the beginning so that we can neutralise them (terrorists) before they cause any damage,” the IAF chief said.
Raha, in his speech, said that India is being seen as a “net security provider” in the Indian Ocean region. The Air Force Day commemorates the establishment of the armed force on October 8, 1932."

In the aftermath of the Uri terror attack and the subsequent surgical strikes conducted by India across the LoC, political parties have come vehemently in support of the Indian army as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Earlier, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi took a major detour from his usual narrative and congratulated Prime Minister Modi for the “first action worthy of his stature”. Now, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has come out in support of the Prime Minister.
In a video released by him, Arvind Kejriwal has not only lauded PM Modi for his actions but also strongly condemned the “false propaganda” being floated around by Pakistan.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Last week, our army bravely avenged the Uri attack – in which 20 soldiers were martyred – and entered the terrorist camps to conduct surgical strikes. I have hundreds of disagreements and contentions with the prime minister on various issues but the conviction that he has shown in this situation, I salute him for it,” Kejriwal said.
He then lashed out at Pakistan saying it had lost all control after the surgical strikes and indulged in blatant false propaganda against India. He describes how Pakistan is taking buses full of journalists to the spot where India claims to have conducted the surgical strikes and tries to oppose the claim by showing that life in the said area is going on as normal.
Emphasising that several international news organisations like BBC and the New York Times were running reports questioning the existence of such an operation by India, Kejriwal added that Pakistan is working hard to insult India on an international level.
“My blood boiled looking at this. The BBC, New York Times also questioned whether the surgical strikes actually happened? Pakistan is hell bent on tarnishing India’s image. I appeal to the prime minister that just like he, along with the army, answered strongly on land, they should also unmask the false propaganda being floated by Pakistan. The way Pakistan is continuously calling us a liar, that should also be challenged. The whole country is with you, we all are with you,” he said.
He ended the video hailing the country."

(Source: File)
Donald Trump is unlikely to “insert” himself in resolving the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan as the US President-elect has signaled his interest in deepening ties with India, a top American expert has said. “It is highly doubtful that Trump administration will consider inserting itself into the volatile Indo-Pakistani dispute, especially when Trump has signaled his interest in prioritising deepening ties with India,” Lisa Curtis of The Heritage Foundation said in an op-ed in The Daily Signal.
Watch What Else Is Making News 

“Indeed, if there is any useful role the US can play in tamping down tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals, it is to press Pakistan to crackdown on anti-India militants that operate freely in Pakistani territory,” Curtis said. In her op-ed, Curtis said concerns are being raised about the US President-elect Donald Trump’s phone conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and what it might mean for his policies toward the subcontinent.
Pakistan in a statement said that Trump, during a telephonic conversation with Prime Minsiter Nawaz Sharif, offered to play “any role” in helping Pakistan address its outstanding issues, which it claimed was a reference to Kashmir issue. “These comments, however, should merely be seen as friendly banter that could have been made to almost any foreign leader,” Curtis said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It is not surprising that Pakistani leaders would take advantage of a polite and warm exchange to push their agenda of bringing international attention to the Indo-Pak conflict in Kashmir,” Curtis wrote. Observing that the US handling of India-Pakistan relations is a delicate matter, she said it is important for US officials to avoid the mediation trap and “any illusion that the US itself can resolve this nearly 70-year-old dispute.”
Referring to the series of attacks against Indian Army bases, Curtis said the Uri attack demonstrates Pakistan’s willingness to up the ante in order to draw international attention to Kashmir at a time when civil protests had been wracking the region. “The US must demonstrate that such Pakistani behaviour is unacceptable and will have consequences,” Curtis said."

Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday slammed Pakistan, saying he was deeply disappointed with that country’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups. “Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolated as such. There are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped,” Singh said in a series of tweets following a terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir that led to the death of 17 jawans. Four terrorists were killed in the attack.
Earlier in the day, Rajnath Sigh briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said those responsible for Sunday’s terror attack will not go unpunished.
“Deeply distressed at the terror incident in Uri and the loss of 17 brave soldiers martyred. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. My heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyred soldiers. Those behind this terror incident would be brought to justice,” Singh tweeted, saying he also appraised PM Modi of the security review meeting held at his residence this afternoon. The meeting was attended by top security officials including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and senior bureaucrats from the Defence and Home Ministry.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The attack in Uri took place early Sunday morning when fidayeens attacked the rear office of the Indian Army’s infantry battalion. Army jawans fought back and neutralised four terrorists. Search operations are currently underway in the area as there could be at least two more terrorists in Uri.

The government also put all airports in the country on high-alert following the attack."

(Source: PTI)
She sought to steer clear of the raging debate over allowing Pakistani players in India amid heightened diplomatic tensions but Olympic bronze-medallist Sakshi Malik on Friday said athletes have the right to compete against fellow rivals anywhere in the world. “Media has been, since morning, wrongly highlighting that I want Pakistani players should be invited to participate in various international sports events. I haven’t said anything like that,” Sakshi told reporters on the sidelines of the 11th anniversary of Garuda Mall.
Sakshi was reacting to a query on Pakistani players being barred from participating in any kind of event in India in the aftermath of Uri attacks and Surgical Attacks carried out by the Indian government.
Clarifying further, Sakshi said she had only said that the players have the rights to play against any other player in the world, and not more than that. “What I told was – players have all the rights – like we participate in the Games (Olympics) and we happen to play against other players, belonging to different countries … I haven’t advocated Pakistani players should be allowed to play in India,” she said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked if she would toe the line of Yuvraj Singh and Saina Nehwal to invest money in startups or any business, Sakshi said she loves wrestling and would like to help kids who do not have the wherewithal to extend their careers. “I love wrestling, and I would love to spend my money to help kids who are in want of money to take up the sport or sustain their careers,” she said.
Sakshi further said money and winning a medal does not make a success story of an individual, but doing good things for the country does. “If I do something good for the country – that is the success for me, not getting money and winning medals – that is not success to me, at all,” Sakshi said.
Sakshi has been flooded with a lot of rewards, which include Rs 2.5 crore awarded to her by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. She said her life has changed a lot since winning a bronze medal in Rio.
“My life has changed a lot. The whole country is beginning to know me, but with this my responsibilities have only increased,” she said.
Replying to a query, Sakshi said she has already begun training for the upcoming World Wrestling League."

In the build-up to India’s strikes on the Line of Control, the Army had been interacting frequently with villagers near the LoC and, on Wednesday afternoon, had sought to assess the preparedness of the only large civilian hospital close to the LoC — the sub-district hospital in Uri.
Two officials of 12 Infantry Brigade stationed in Uri visited the hospital. “They asked about the operation theatre and other facilities and left,” a doctor said.

 
Since the Uri attack, officials of local units had been meeting village heads and other leaders and asking them to report any suspected movement to the nearest Army unit. “We were asked not to venture out after 6 pm. They said this was a precautionary measure after the attack on the camp,” said a village head in Uri who attended one such meeting in his village near the LoC.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Col Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman in Srinagar, said the Army interacts regularly with village leaders but denied there is no restriction in the movement of civilians. “Some coordination is required for the safety of the local population so that no untoward incident takes place during patrols,” he said.
In Gwalata, Churunda and Silikote situated on or near the LoC, villagers said there has been increase in the movement of soldiers close to the LoC. “We have border passes, but if any relative who lives in other village intends to visit us, we have to register his name in the camp,’’ said a villager in Silikote.
The Army claimed to have arrested two guides Sunday, reportedly residents of PoK, from border areas in Uri. They have been now handed over to the NIA that is investigating the terrorist attack. Troopers of 19 Infantry Division based in Baramulla and 28 Infantry Division based in Kupwara were reportedly engaged in operations launched from Nowgam and Tangdhar sectors.
The 19 Infantry Division has been under pressure since the terrorist attack on the 12 Infantry Brigade headquarters in Uri."

Actor Amitabh Bachchan refused to comment on the political call to ban Pakistan actors in the wake of the Uri terror attacks. Addressing the media on his 74th birthday, Bachchan said, “This is not the time and I don’t think it is right to put forward these questions. Who said what, where and how… this is not the time.”
Standing by the army in these troubled times, Bachchan echoed the sentiments of Akshay Kumar and said, ” The nation is incensed we all know that. People of this country are very angry by the incidents that have been happening at the border. I think it is the time to show solidarity to our jawans and our armed forces who are sacrificing their lives so that you and me can be safe here. That is what needs to be put in question. Nothing else.”

Responding to another question about how fair is to ban an artist, Bachchan said, “I respect every artiste.”

He was also asked if he would indeed by paying a musical homage to Uri attack martyrs. “Someone praised the Hanuman Chalisa I had recently sung and said I should pay homage to Uri martyrs. I said I would like to do it but would need to have some inputs. But it was reported that it is indeed happening,” he added.
When asked about his comment on Twitter after surgical strikes, Amitabh said, “That is a line from my film, Major Saab.”
 
Bollywood as a whole still remains divided on the issue of Pakistani actors. While few have opined that actors from across the border should issue strong statements condemning terrorist attacks, others have vociferously protest against the ban. Radhika Apte recently expressed that banning Pakistani actors is not the solution. “Pakistani actors should also be allowed to come here and do films in India. I don’t think they should be banned,” the actress opined.

In reality, majority of Bollywood continues to support Pakistani artists, throwing their weight behind them and demanding to know how slapping of a ban would stop terrorism. After Karan Johar, Salman Khan too spoke out in favour of Pakistani artistes delinking them from terrorism and terrorists. “They come here on valid visas given by our government. They are artistes not terrorists, ” said Khan
In September, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had called for a ban on all Pakistani actors working in India and also said that they will not allow films to release which have Pakistani actors in them. Later, the Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association (IMPPA) called for a blanket ban on artistes and technicians from Pakistan. However, IMPPA had said films with Pakistani actors which have been finished — Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees – will be released.
Since the Uri terror attack of September 18 that killed 19 soldiers. Pakistani actors were slammed for not condemning the terror attacks. Ever since then, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan had posted Facebook messages condemning terror.

In his official Facebook post, Fawad wrote, “I’ve been in Lahore since July as my wife and I had been expecting our second child. I’ve received numerous requests from the media and from well wishers worldwide asking me for my thoughts on the sad incidents that took place in the past few weeks. As a father of two little children, I pray and wish like many others that together we can build and live in a more peaceful world. I believe we owe it to our children who will shape our tomorrow. This is the first time I have spoken on the matter. Please disregard any other words attributed to me during this time because I have not said them. I thank all my fans and fellow artists from Pakistan, India and people in general all over the world who have shown continued support for their belief in love and understanding to unite a divisive world.”
On Monday, Mahira posted, “As a Pakistani and citizen of the world I strongly condemn any act of terror, any loss of human life no matter which soil it is on. I will not rejoice in bloodshed and war. I will always hope for and dream of a world where my child can live without it, and always plead with everyone to imagine a peaceful world. It has also been in this time my faith in saner minds and goodness has been restored, thank you for the messages, love and support.”"

In a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over India’s moves against Pakistan after the Uri attack, key BJP ally Shiv Sena on Monday said the neighbouring country’s Premier Nawaz Sharif is now showing off a “56-inch chest”. The Sena also said it feared that India had actually been isolated in the world with its efforts yielding little result other than mere “lip service” by global leaders.
“All of India’s efforts to forge global relations have proved futile as no country actually backed India over the Uri attacks. Global leaders did mere lip service of condemning the terror attacks but the BJP’s social media cell took some other meaning out of it and went boasting how Pakistan has been isolated over the issue,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.
In the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, Modi had famously claimed at a poll rally in Uttar Pradesh that a “56 inch chest” can solve problems faced by the country. The Sena noted that neither did Russia stop its joint military drill with Pakistan nor China did condemned the terror attacks. Additionally, Indonesia is offering Pakistan defence equipment and Islamic organisations are openly backing Pakistan while Nepal too wants to maintain good relations with it, the Sena said.

“During the 1971 war with Bangladesh, Russia had sent its troops to India to support Indira Gandhi. We cannot see such friendship today. You (the BJP) may keep on shouting that Pakistan has been isolated. But all your efforts are ultimately futile. We have started fearing if it is India which has actually been isolated over the Uri attack,” it said.
“Pakistan has already declared war against India. They have shed blood of our soldiers right from Pathankot to Uri while we are only gloating by issuing threats to Pakistan. Mere words won’t work now. It is time to give them a tit for tat reply,” it added."

Modi, who held comprehensive talks with Singapore Prime Minister on ways to enhance cooperation in key sectors including trade and investment, said defence and security cooperation is a key pillar of strategic partnership between India and Singapore.

Asserting that “rising tide of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalisation are grave challenges to our security”, Modi said, “they threaten the very fabric of our societies.
“It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace and humanity need to stand and act together against this menace. Today, we have agreed to enhance our cooperation to counter these threats, including in the domain of cyber security.”

The two countries also inked three pacts including the one dealing with Intellectual Property rights to facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations.
Describing trade and investment as bedrock of bilateral relationship, Modi said India has embarked on a path of strong economic growth and transformation and in this journey, it regards Singapore as a key partner.

According to reports, the Army has sent three choppers from army’s 19 divisional headquarters in Baramulla to Uri.
The encounter is underway between the unknown number of terrorists and the Armed Forces in the area, in which reportedly six soldiers have been injured out of which three have been airlifted to the nearest hospital.

For three nights in a row, Arnab Goswami has debated, no sorry, there is no debate on The Newshour (Times Now), berated Pakistani artists—Fawad Khan, Mahira and Atif Aslam, that-singer or-whoever — for not criticising the Uri terror attack accompanied by a dismissive wave of the hand and a contemptuous curl of the lip. Since he could not train his guns on the Pakistani actors, he did the next best thing: scold, badger and lecture the guests speaking up for them who tried with varying degrees of desperation and resignation to get a word in.

His campaign against Pakistani artists – it is a campaign and not a discussion after all — his unrestrained and utterly ungracious takedown of anyone who dares to speak against his line, is a blood sport minus the thrill. The anchor, who has long dropped all pretence of being a moderator, firmly aligned himself with all those who thought that the Pakistani actors shouldn’t be allowed to work in India for the time being — together they hunted down and subdued anyone who took a line that ever so slightly deviated from theirs.
It was film director Saeed Mirza one day, actor Om Puri another and Sudheendra Kulkarni a third day. So chuffed is Goswami for the big fight that sometimes he can’t tell his friends from his enemies. For instance, he rubbed actor Mita Vashisht who agreed with him on the issue of the Pakistani actors, the wrong way when she suggested we do something about the forgotten families of the Kargil heroes instead of discussing this issue. Tired of his constant shouting in her ear, she took off her headphones, said `shut up’ and walked away from the din of the debate.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

More than the outrage, it is the implied contempt of artists that Goswami’s dismissive wave of the hand and shared smiles in the studio imply that is both unfortunate and unwarranted. In the gesture is implied a dismissal of artists and their art as a flimsy, almost a trivial pursuit.
When Sudheendra Kulkarni tried to read out a letter written by former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to ghazal great Mehdi Hasan in 2001, in which he speaks about his music that “like the music of all the great artistes of India and Pakistan, reminds us of the many common bonds of culture and spirituality that unite our two countries. Its equal popularity on both sides of the border illustrates that a life of peace and goodwill, and a readiness to appreciate the best of each other, is the natural aspiration of our two peoples,” Goswami paid scant attention to him. In his single-minded devotion to his agenda, this was not the time and his studio not the place to talk music and peace and if anyone dared show him a different point of view, he declared it an affront to Col VN Thapar, father of slain Kargil hero Capt Vijayant Thapar, who was present in the studio — that promptly shut up everyone.
Whether Pakistani actors should come out in the open against the Uri attacks, whether they should be allowed to work in India can be talking points but should this question and its answer be allowed to become a litmus test for patriotism? Is this the only defining quality of patriotism? If everyone with an argument is told to go to the front before talking, then why are they invited to a debate in the first place? Does holding a contrary view amount to belittling soldiers? The Nation may or may not want to know the answers to these questions but it certainly needs to introspect.
It would be easy to dismiss Goswami as an over-the-top anchor whose antics are almost comical if it weren’t for his following. It would be funny if it weren’t for the fact that his views often find a mirror reflection in the relentless messages circulating on WhatsApp, persuading us to boycott films one day, Chinese goods another and taunting some on bleeding at Fawad’s departure when they should be shedding a tear for our soldiers.
The argument has now successfully been reduced to an artist-soldier binary and there are no prizes for guessing who comes out looking like the loser.
In the 1999 Aamir-Khan starrer Sarfarosh, Naseeruddin Shah plays Gulfam Hassan, a soft-spoken Pakistani ghazal singer with nefarius designs on India. The film received many accolades but also some criticism for choosing an artist as a terrorist when for decades artists and their art had been the only bridge over the troubled India-Pakistan relationship. In times when the two nations were not talking, the songs from both sides of the border did the talking and so many felt that the film by showing an artist as a terrorist was doing great disservice to the fraternity.
Much has changed in succeeding years but it seems the artist is still the villain."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday held a meeting which is said to have discussed “maximum exploitation” by India of the three western rivers of the Indus system. And on Thursday, he will chair a meeting to review India’s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan.
This is the first time that longstanding bilateral pacts are being pulled off the shelf for “review”. Despite generally tense relations, the two countries have over the years put in place a raft of confidence building measures and agreements that have withstood the many downs in their relationship.

Cross-LoC bus: The “Karvan-e-Aman” rolled on April 7, 2005 as a fortnightly service on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route, now runs weekly, and has rarely been suspended. A similar service between Poonch in Jammu and Rawalakot in PoK was started on June 20, 2006 through the Chakan da Bagh crossing. It operates once a week.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Cross-LoC trade: Another Kashmir-specific CBM, it was launched on October 21, 2008, and remained unaffected by the Mumbai attacks. Despite the absence of banking facilities that has kept the trade to barter, and restricted telecommunication links, trade volumes over the last 7 years are estimated to have crossed Rs 4,000 crore. Trucks now ply 4 days a week. 21 items are allowed, and the trade has been suspended at times — often during bouts of firing on the LoC, and when a truck from PoK was found carrying narcotics.
Trading across the LoC also takes place on the Poonch-Rawalakot route 4 days a week. A Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been formed among traders from Jammu, Kashmir and PoK.
Delhi-Lahore bus: The “Sada-e-Sarhad” service was begun in 1999, with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee travelling on its inaugural run. The bus continued through the Kargil war, was halted in the aftermath of the December 2001 Parliament attack, resumed in October 2003, and continued through the crisis of 2008. It now operates 6 days a week.
Amritsar-Lahore bus: The twice weekly “Dosti” bus, launched on January 20, 2006, crosses over at Wagah. There is also a bus service from Amritsar to Nankana Sahib.
Samjhauta Express: The Delhi-Lahore train through Attari was discontinued after the Parliament attack, but restarted in January 2004. The February 2007 bombing that killed 68 passengers, most of them Pakistani, did not lead Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri to cancel his visit to New Delhi scheduled for the day after.
Thar Express: It was started in February 2006 to connect Karachi to Jodhpur through Munabao on the Indian side. The train runs weekly from both sides.
Wagah border trade: In 2012, Pakistan moved from a positive list to a negative list for trade with India, with 1,209 items that could not be traded. Of the rest, 137 items could be traded through the land crossing at Wagah. India imports mainly cement, gypsum, rock salt, dry dates and textiles; Pakistan imports mainly vegetables and cotton. In April 2012, the Integrated Check Post at Attari was inaugurated with improved trade and travel infrastructure. According to details on the MEA web site, the terminal is spread over 118 acres. The two sides have discussed several other initiatives too.
Pakistani investment in India: Perhaps the most remarkable step India took was to notify, on August 1, 2012, a decision to allow investment from Pakistan. In September, RBI removed restrictions on investment in Pakistan from India. It is not clear if any Pakistani has made use of this provision.
2003 ceasefire: After intense global backchannel efforts to bring India and Pakistan back to the negotiating table after the Parliament attack, the ceasefire came into force on November 26, 2003. It is not a written agreement. In August 2005, some terms were spelt out in a joint statement: both sides agreed to upgrade the existing hotline between the DGMOs by that September, hold monthly flag meetings between local commanders, and not to build any new posts and defence works along the LoC. The arrangement worked well until 2008, but after that, there have been dozens of violations each year, peaking in 2013. But the hotline still exists, and the DGMOs were in touch soon after the Uri attack.
Exchange of prisoners’ lists: Every year on January 1 and July 1, India and Pakistan exchange lists of nationals of each country who are lodged in the prisons of the other. The system came into effect in 2008, when scores of Indian fishermen were being detained by the Pakistan Coast Guard. The list is meant to facilitate easier tracking of prisoners and verification of their nationalities and sentences. The exchange has taken place regularly except for a year when India did not submit its list.
Visas: The two sides agreed to a new visa regime in May 2012, relaxing some of the earlier controls for the first time since 1974. It eased travel restrictions for businessmen, introduced a new category of “group tourism”, allowed visas on arrival to those over the age of 65, provided for a timeframe of 45 days to issue visas, and increased the earlier 3-city permissions to 5. But its implementation continues to be dogged by old caveats.
Additionally, a Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines has existed since 1974. In 2007, the government told Parliament that 15 religious shrines in Pakistan are covered under the agreement. In 2014, it told the House that Pakistan was yet to respond to a 2005 request to include a shrine in Balochistan in the list."

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has come out in support of Karan Johar, whose upcoming directorial venture Ae Dil Hai Mushkil featuring Fawad Khan, is facing trouble after cinema owners association decided to stall the release of movies starring Pakistani artistes.
Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI) yesterday announced that they would not screen movies starring Pakistani artistes in the four states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa.

“The world must learn from us.. We solve all our problems by blaming it on movies and banning it.. #ADHM . With you on this @karanjohar,” Kashyap tweeted.
Johar’s movie stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the lead. The decision taken by COEAI mainly covers single screen theatres and comes amid tension between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of Uri attack last month.
Johar tweeted, “See you at the cinemas on the 28th of this month! #AeDilKiDiwali”.
Many industry people including Om Puri, Shyam Benegal, Vikram Bhatt, Mukesh Bhatt and Censor Board chief Pahalaj Nihalani have slammed the ban on the release of the film which have completed production.
Filmmaker Sajid Nadiadwala says the decision of cinema owners association to not allow screening of films with Pakistani artistes was unfortunate and he would request them to reconsider the move as that will result in losses for Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India yesterday announced that it won’t release movies starring actors from Pakistan, in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa. This has put an uncertainty on the release of “Ae Dil

Hai Mushkil” as it features Pakistani heartthrob Fawad Khan.
The movie, starring Aishwarya Rai, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma is slated to hit theatres on October 28."

Four terrorists, who carried out attack on an Army base in Uri, are suspected to have come from a militant training camp located at a place called Pir Chana Sai in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).
During interrogation, two persons who were arrested for allegedly helping the four terrorists as “guides” said that they had started their journey from Pir Chana Sai in Gyarahbad in PoK where the militants have a training camp, official sources said.

The two–Faisal Hussain Awan and Ahsaan Khursheed–both residents of Muzaffarabad in PoK, were produced before a designated court in Jammu which remanded them to NIA’s custody.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
They have since been brought to the national capital where they would be interrogated by a joint team of officials of various security agencies besides being subjected to scientific tests.
It is claimed that during their preliminary interrogation, they have admitted to facilitating infiltration by a group of four JeM militants who carried out the Uri attack."

(Source: Arvind Kejriwal/Twitter)
Starting from the Uri attacks on September 18 this year, India and Pakistan’s already strained relations have become even more tense. The Indian army lost 19 of its soldiers in the attack. But soon enough, in retaliation, the Army forces conducted surgical strikes along the Line of Control on terrorist launch pads on September 28. Though this move received a heartwarming response from many in India, within the country political leaders had different takes.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said, “Humare jawan hain jinho ne khoon diya hai, jinho ne surgical  strike kiya, unke khoon ke peeche aap (PM) chhupe huye ho. Unki(jawans) aap (PM) dalali kar rahe ho. (Our jawans who sacrificed their lives, who did surgical strikes, you are hiding behind them. Pandering their blood).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Gandhi’s remark did not go down well. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter to condemn him. He wrote it was wrong on Gandhi’s part to term the brave sacrifices of the soldiers as “khoon ki dalaali”.  The minister posted a video of an interview he gave in which he expounded more on his stand.

Within hours of being posted, many Twitter users seemed like they had a lot to say in reply to Kejriwal.
This is Kejriwal’s tweet.

Here are some of the reactions his tweet garnered.


A Twitter user decided to simplify Kejriwal’s interview condemning Gandhi using this rather hilarious metaphor:

And this triggered a train of similar such tweets, and we tried hard to stifle a giggle.

Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, condemned for being mum on the Uri terror attack which led to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, on Saturday broke her silence saying that she “condemns any act of terror, no matter which soil it is on”.
“In the five years that I have been working as an actor I believe that I have tried my best to keep my country’s respect intact – by being a professional and by representing Pakistan here and elsewhere to the best of my abilities,” the actress posted on her facebook account.
“As a Pakistani and citizen of the world, I strongly condemn any act of terror, any loss of human life no matter which soil it is on! I will not rejoice in bloodshed and war. I will always hope for and dream of a world where my child can live without it, and always plead with everyone to imagine a peaceful world.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It has also been in this time my faith in saner minds and goodness has been restored, thank you for the messages, love and support,” she further added.
The actress became household name in India thanks to her Pakistani TV show ” Humsafar” , which aired on Zindagi channel. She was also in India to shoot for superstar Shah Rukh Khan starrer “Raees”, which is scheduled to release next year.
After the September 18 Uri attack, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave India and said they would not let their movies release in India.
The Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution banning Pakistanis from working in films being made in India as they were upset that Pakistani artistes did not condemn the incident.
In retaliation, some Pakistani theatre chain owners banned the screening of Indian films.
Recently, popular Pakistani musicians like Shafqat Amanat Ali and Salman Ahmad had condemned the Uri attack and had hoped for normalcy to return in both the countries.
Even Pakistani actor Fawad Khan released a statement on his social networking website account and said that he is praying for “a more peaceful world”."

(Source: File)
Dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address targeting Pakistan over the Uri terror attack as an attempt to divert attention, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Sunday urged the former to chalk long-term solution to such problems. Mayawati said the nation expects Prime Minister Modi’s assurance that incidents like Uri will not be repeated. “The nation expects the Prime Minister to take stringent steps post the Uri attack so that such incidents do not occur again. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not able to build trust among the Indians that such incidents will not occur,” Mayawati said.
“Our Prime Minister instead of finding a long-term solution to the problem is distracting people by making such speeches,” she added. Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister over his reference to Pakistan over war against poverty, unemployment and development, Mayawati said that the former before advising Islamabad should introspect as to what has his government done for the people of India.
“The Prime Minister in his address on Saturday including the Uri attack also spoke of development in the nation. I would like to say that instead of giving advice to Pakistan, Prime Minister Modi should look at his own government. There has been no development in their rule, he should also see whether his government has done enough to advise someone else,” she said. Earlier on Saturday, the Prime Minister launched a scathing attack on Pakistan and said that India would never forget the Uri terror attack and would make all efforts to isolate Islamabad globally.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“A day will come when the people of Pakistan will go against their own government to fight terrorism. India has been successful in isolating you (Pakistan) globally, and we will intensify our efforts to make sure that you are isolated globally. The people of Pakistan should ask their leaders that India and Pakistan got freedom in the same year, but India exports software and your (Pakistan) leaders are exporting terrorists,” said Prime Minister Modi, while addressing a public rally in Kozhikode.
The Prime Minister said he can see a lot of potential to make sure that the 21st century becomes Asia’s 21st century, adding that all the countries in Asia are working for it, except one. Asserting that terrorism is the enemy of humanity, Prime Minister Modi called upon the international community to join hands to defeat terrorism.

Recalling the sacrifices of the 18 soldiers, who were killed in the Uri terror attack, Prime Minister Modi said India is very proud of the armed forces. “There have been 17 fidayeen attempts by our neighbour, which our brave soldiers foiled. Leaders of the neighbouring country used to say that they will fight for 1,000 years; where are they now,” he asked.
The Prime Minister further said more than 110 terrorists have been killed in the past few months by the Indian Army as they were trying to infiltrate. Taking a jibe at Pakistan, Prime Minister Modi said India is exporting engineers all over the world, whereas Islamabad is exporting terrorists. “I want to tell Pakistan that India is ready to fight you. If you have guts, come forward to fight against poverty. Let’s see who wins? Who is able to defeat poverty and illiteracy first, Pakistan or India” he added."

Pitching Nepal as a “dynamic bridge” between India and China, Prime Minister Prachanda floated a proposal for trilateral strategic ties to Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Nepalese media reported on Sunday. Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ during the trilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit yesterday expressed Nepal’s desire to act as a “dynamic bridge” between the two Asian giants and to reap the benefit of playing such a role.

The report about the “trilateral meeeting” was reported by Nepal’s The Himalayan Times along with a photo of the leaders.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India, meanwhile, said both Xi and Prachanda were waiting in the leaders’ lounge when Prime Minister Modi also reached there as he had to go with all the BRICS leaders for an informal dinner, turning the bilateral into a ‘chance trilateral’.
External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup in Goa termed the episode “entirely coincidental”.
“It was just entirely coincidental that in the leaders’ lounge, all three were present at the same time. The bilateral meeting between China and Nepal had already ended. So, I don’t know on what basis people are calling it a trilateral meeting. It is perfectly normal in a multilateral setting for leaders to be together in a lounge or on the sidelines or somewhere else,” Swarup said.
The Himalayan Times story, on its part, cited a statement issued by Prachanda’s secretariat on the Prime Minister’s personal website and said he “floated a proposal for trilateral strategic partnership among the three countries”.
Modi and Xi acknowledged as ‘significant’ and said they were positive towards it, the report said.
The Nepalese premier, who reached India to attend the BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit on Saturday, first held a one-on-one meeting with Chinese President Xi which lasted for around 20 minutes and later Modi joined them. The leaders discussed issues of common interests, Prachanda’s personal secretary Prakash Dahal, who is also his son, was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, Prachanda said during the meeting that “we (Nepal) are located between two giant countries. We want to become a dynamic bridge between the two countries and reap the benefit”.
“During the meeting, I put forth the issue of strategic partnership with emphasis,” Dahal said, adding that “the Indian Prime Minister and Chinese President said Nepal’s proposal on strategic partnership is significant and they agreed to it”.
Noting that Buddha, Pashupatinath and Janaki connected Nepal, India and China, Prachanda was quoted as saying that Nepal can play a role of a bridge between India and China and help them build good relationship at present also.
He further said Nepal was inching towards the goals of development and wanted to establish a balanced, friendly and strategic relationship with both the neighbours, the report said.
The Nepalese premier also expressed his hope that the trilateral meeting could play a significant role in setting up an “epochal relationship” between Nepal, India and China, it said.
In response, Chinese President Xi was quoted as saying that the size of the country did not bear much significance and Nepal could become a bridge between India and China.
He also praised Nepal’s role in keeping an equidistant relationship with China and India while expressing belief that the relations between the three countries would strengthen in the future.
Noting that the three countries shared “geographical, emotional and cultural friendship, Indian Prime Minister Modi said India was positive towards Nepal’s proposal on trilateral partnership,” the report said.
Prachanda’s spouse Sita Dahal was also present at the meeting."

(Source: File)
With the benefit of hindsight, one can learn several lessons from the BRICS summit in Goa. Before this event, close observers of India’s foreign policy in general and of BRICS in particular, Samir Saran and Abhijnan Rej, had emphasised the need “for creating new and agile institutions that can help the group”. Such an objective was ambitious and the Goa meeting has allowed BRICS to work in that direction.
In the final declaration, the members countries not only felicitated themselves for “the operationalisation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)”, but agreed to set up a credit agency. Here, BRICS are true to their DNA: Basically, this “geo-economic alliance”, to use the words of Saran and Rej, “perceives power concentration in the hands of Bretton Woods institutions as unfair and seeks to promote alternative models of development”. This is why, like in every summit since 2009, BRICS have targeted the governance of the IMF in Goa. Not only have they asked for a new quota formula that would “ensure that the increased voice of the dynamic emerging and developing economies reflects their relative contributions to the world economy”, but they have also called for the European countries to cede two chairs on the Executive Board of the IMF. For years, the targeting of West-dominated institutions has provided BRICS with a common cause.
But is it still sufficient today? The question is particularly relevant from the point of view of India after the acceleration of its rapprochement with the US in several domains, including economic and defence matters. This rapprochement has been resented by two key BRICS players, Russia and China, which have recently made moves bound to be perceived as provocations by India. Russia, which has already agreed to sell attack helicopters to Pakistan, sent troops to this country in September last for first-ever military joint manoeuvres. The Indian ambassador to Moscow had to convey to Russia New Delhi’s views that “military cooperation with Pakistan which is a country that sponsors terrorism as a matter of state policy is a wrong approach.”. Relations with China were even more tense since, over the last six months, China blocked India’s attempt at joining the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), made military incursions in Arunachal Pradesh and vetoed in the UN an India-supported resolution designating Masood Azhar as a terrorist. (Azhar is the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed, one of the Pakistani groups already on a UN blacklist, which has been held responsible for the Uri attack and the killing of 19 Indian armymen).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Goa summit was bound to be “a moment of reckoning”, as Harsh Pant pointed out, precisely because of this context. All the more so as it happened at a time when the Indian government had initiated moves to isolate Pakistan on the international stage in the wake of the Uri attack. On that ground, the glass remained half empty. Certainly, the Indian attempt of isolating Pakistan from other South Asian countries — that had resulted in the cancellation of the Islamabad SAARC meeting in October — found another expression in the Outreach Summit of BRICS leaders of BIMSTEC countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, a clear signal that, in its region, India will look east even more than before. But the final declaration spared Pakistan.
On the first day of the summit, Modi had targeted Pakistan calling it the “mothership” of terrorism: “Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership. This country shelters not just terrorists. It nurtures a mindset,” Modi said. However, the final declaration did not mention Pakistan, nor key words like “cross-border terrorism” or “state-sponsored terrorism” and the only terror groups named — ISIS, al Qaeda and Jabhat al-Nusra — were not Pakistani. Russia and China were not on the same wave length so far as this security issue was concerned. This hiatus may be due to Russian and Chinese perceptions that saving the Syrian regime is their priority and that both countries will need Pakistan to fight the Islamist groups listed above if they regroup in Afghanistan after being defeated in the Middle East.
In Goa, China has taken Pakistan’s side more explicitly than Russia, which somewhat bowed to Beijing instead of supporting New Delhi. A day after Modi called Pakistan a “mothership of terrorism”, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared that their country opposed “linking terrorism with any specific country or religion”. It also said: “China and Pakistan are all-weather friends”.
Such divergences did not prevent India from using the Goa meeting to relate to China bilaterally. For instance, President Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi agreed to hold a dialogue on New Delhi’s bid for membership of the NSG. But China will clearly not help India to isolate Pakistan, as it was already evident from the CPEC project and, more precisely, from the fact that “its” Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (which is much bigger than the NDB) has recently granted a $300 million loan for extending the hydropower plant of Tarbela, jointly with the World Bank. Incidentally, Xi Jinping also used China’s financial resources to relate more effectively to another neighbour of India, Bangladesh: He stopped over in Dhaka on his way to Goa to sign off loans worth $24 bn, with a country to which India has lent $2 bn last year.
The Goa summit enabled India to re-engage Russia (or vice versa). On the one hand, New Delhi and Moscow signed a $4-5 billion deal on the S-400 defence missile system. On the other, “India recognised Russian side’s effort towards achieving a political and negotiated settlement of the situation in Syria”. This joint statement was issued by Vladimir Putin and Modi at a time when the Obama administration was highly critical of the Russian strikes on Aleppo.
The contradictions between India’s policies vis-à-vis Pakistan and the US and its membership of the BRICS, a

grouping dominated by Russia and China, have led observers to think about alternative routes, like the revival of IBSA. In a post BRICS summit article, Samir Saran mentions that IBSA countries have met “on the sidelines” in Goa and that such a grouping (“in many ways more organic than BRICS”) “should engage with both the US and one European power, like Germany, to promote a concert of democracies across continents, bringing advanced economies alongside emerging ones”. More than one European country might support such a move."

The NIA probe into the September 2016 Uri attack has found that the assault was carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) operatives and not Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists, as claimed by the Army earlier. At a press meet organised to commemorate its Raising Day, the NIA said the evidence it had gathered so far suggested that the Uri attack, which claimed the lives of 18 soldiers, was carried out by LeT.
“Evidence collected till now suggests that the Uri attack was carried out by LeT operatives. Similarly, there are strong indications that the Nagrota attack was carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed,” NIA DG Sharad Kumar said.

A senior NIA officer explained that the data collected from GPS sets recovered from terrorists killed in Uri attack showed that they were launched from launchpads in Pakistan that are known to be under LeT control. “Matrix sheets from different operations carried out by LeT have been tallied and they also match with matrix sheets recovered here. An additional evidence is the poster that appeared in Pakistan where LeT claimed the attack and called for performing Namaz-e-Janaza for the slain terrorists,” the officer said.
On October 26, The Indian Express had first reported about this poster. The poster named one perpetrator as Gujranwala resident Muhammad Anas alias Abu Siraqa. It invited local residents to join namaz for the Lashkar’s “lion-hearted holy warrior Abu Siraqa Muhammad Anas, who sent 177 Hindu soldiers to hell at the Uri Brigade camp in occupied Kashmir, and thus drank from the glass of martyrdom”. It carried a picture of Hafiz Saeed.
The Army had earlier claimed that the attack was likely to have been carried out by JeM. “All four killed were foreign terrorists and had carried with them items which had Pakistani markings. Initial reports indicate that the slain terrorists belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed tanzeem (outfit),” Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh had been quoted in the media as saying after the attacks.
The NIA, too, after arrest of two teenagers from Pakistan on September 27, 2016, said, “During interrogation they have disclosed that they were tasked by JeM commanders to facilitate infiltration of a group of four JeM cadres who carried out the Uri Army camp attack.” The NIA has found that there were four attackers in the October 6 attacks on an Army camp in Langate, Kupwara. One attacker is suspected to have fled while three were killed by the Army."

(Source: Reuters)
A week after the newly-appointed International Hockey Federation (FIH) president Narinder Batra confirmed their participation, the world body said they had ‘withdrawn Pakistan’s invitation’ to the junior World Cup, which begins in Lucknow next week. Malaysia have been named as the replacement side for the 16-team event that will be held from December 8 to 18.
In a release, the FIH said they had held ‘considerable discussions’ with the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), but did not receive necessary confirmations.
Interestingly, PHF’s executive secretary Zain Aman had told The Indian Express hours before the FIH decision on Monday that the team’s itinerary had been finalised.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We have applied for the visas long back and are in touch with the Indian embassy. As soon as we receive our visas, the team will leave for India,” he said. He was unavailable for comment later.
FIH, on the other hand, said PHF were late to apply for visas and had not even completed the formalities for finalising of accomodation at the host city. “Visas had been applied for after the official deadline and no accommodation was confirmed within the set deadlines. Despite a number of correspondence and reminders, the PHF was not able to show that their team would be able to travel to Lucknow for the event which begins in only a few days’ time,” the FIH said in a statement.
Pakistan’s participation in the junior World Cup was always shrouded in doubt even though they had qualified for the event. PHF secretary Shahbaz Ahmed had earlier said the ongoing tensions between the two countries and the daily cross border incidents were a matter of concern.
The last time a Pakistani side in any sport travelled to India was in December 2014, when the hockey team took part in the Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar. Their kabaddi team pulled out of the world cup in October due to security fears following a series of protests against Pakistani nationals by political groups after the Uri attacks.
The decision to remove Pakistan from the World Cup comes days after Batra was elected as the FIH president with an overwhelming majority. He had claimed to have received support from Pakistan.
Although he had said that the FIH had received confirmation from their Pakistani counterparts, Batra acknowledged they had ‘two or three’ back-up teams ready to replace them. “FIH has substantial contractual obligations to its partners to deliver a full number of matches at the forthcoming Uttar Pradesh Hockey Junior World Cup Men, Lucknow 2016. With the event starting in only a few days’ time, today was the last possibility for FIH to ensure the quality of the event, with a full complement of 16 teams playing in Lucknow,” the FIH said."

“Strongly condemn outrageous terrorist attack on Army base in Uri; tributes to brave soldiers who made supreme sacrifice.

The attack comes two years after militants had carried out a similar type of attack at Mohra in the same area. Ten security personnel were killed in the attack that took place on December 5, 2014.

It is believed that the attack was the handiwork of a freshly infiltrated group of militants who could have entered along the Salamabad Nallah into the town.

The editorial in Panchjanya underlines the need to gain freedom from “slave mentality” and says that “India has been a major hunting ground for those who cast the net of mental slavery”. It slams colonial historians and Indologists who came from abroad and presented a distorted version of Indian history. “Is it a mere coincidence,” it asks, “ that after the transfer of power from British, leftist historians, patronised by the establishment, happily took over the duty of offering wrong interpretations that created animosity and fissures in society?” It demands a discussion on the “suspicious” bond between the colonialists and the leftist historians. “This embrace of leftists with capitalism needs analysis,” it says. Patronage by the establishment gave the leftist historians opportunity to cover up their “tarnished past”. Why don’t the history textbooks mention that the leftists supported the British rule during the Quit India movement, it asks. RSS founder-president K.B.

Rajagopalachari attended the function. “Why is this not taught to the children of this country?” The “concoted theory of Aryan invasion” has been proved wrong across the world. Why is it still taught in India? The editorial asks.

The editorial in Organiser, ‘Where Communists Meet Islamists,’ comments on the attacks on RSS swayamsevaks in Kerala. It notes that “Shajahan Velluvakkandi, a native of Kannur, who was recently arrested by the Delhi Police for his suspected IS links revealed plans of targeting the RSS-BJP leaders in Kerala and Tamil Nadu”. “Under the garb of Communism a new inhuman alliance has emerged in this God’s Own State,” the editorial notes. The CPI (M) has “monopolised not only polity but all spheres of life through violence and astute combination of muscle and money power,” it adds. “Why there are pockets of ‘party villages’ where no other political party can dare to campaign or appoint a polling agent?” the editorial asks. “This ideology of Red terror, about which Dr Ambedkar had warned time and again, has met with another dangerous ideology of Islamism, the other threat Babasaheb had cautioned about,” it notes. Noting that “maximum number (21) of youth arrested with ISIS links are from Kerala”, it says both the Communists and Islamists “believe in violence as a political means and have the common target in the form of RSS”. Contending that “this deadly alliance of intolerant ideologies has potential to convert Kerala into a hell,” the editorial underlines the “urgent need to expose the destructionist design not just to save Kerala but also Bharat and Bharatiyata”.
Diplomatic Victory
An article in Organiser notes that “Bharat scored a victory of sorts in the contentious river waters dispute with Pakistan when the World Bank allowed it to go ahead with the construction of hydroelectric power projects on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers”.
“Diplomatically,” it says, “it is a major victory for Bharat because Pakistan has been opposing the initiative internationally on the pretext that it would curtail it’s share of river waters”. Pakistan has been opposing the construction of the Kishanganga (330 mw) and Ratle (850 mw) hydroelectric power plants on the grounds that it is “violative of the provisions” of the Indus Water Treaty. “Pakistan wanted the planned storage capacity of the projects to be reduced from 24 million cubic metres to eight million cubic metres, and demanded that the height of the dams to be reduced,” it says. India contested these objections that “it had never reduced the water flow to Pakistan”.
Elaborating India’s strategy behind the move, it says that “Bharat decided to exploit to the maximum the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers. “After the Uri attack in which 19 Indian Army soldiers were killed in September last, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while holding a high-level meeting to review the 56 years old Indus Water Treaty, had announced that ‘blood and water’ cannot flow together,” it says."

Condemning the attack on the army base at Uri, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today said the country has a decisive Prime Minister who would give a befitting reply to those involved in the terror strike. The Chief Minister said, any attack on unity and integrity of the country should be given an apt reply. The NDA government at the Centre was fully committed to uphold the sovereignty of the country and protect its borders by foiling such attacks, he said at a Sangat Darshan programme in Lambi assembly segment in Muktsar.
Badal said such incidents must be dealt with a heavy hand to avoid any threat to the unity and integrity of the nation. Commenting on possibilities of former Aam Aadmi Party convener Sucha Singh Chottepur forming a new front, he said in the poll season many such fronts would mushroom in the state. These fronts would hardly have any impact on state’s polity, as the people of state were wise and would out rightly reject such fronts, he said People don’t rely on such leaders who have ditched their mother party for satiating their lust for power, he added.
In earlier Sangat Darshans at Haakuwala, Fatta Khera, Warring Khera, Fatuhiwala, Singhewala, Dhaani Singhewala, Mithdi Budgir villages, Badal said the SAD-BJP alliance government in the last 10 years has supplied free power worth Rs 50,000 crore to farmers to bail them out of agrarian

crisis. The CM said, Punjab was the only state in the country to provide Atta-Dal scheme to weaker sections and free treatment for fatal diseases like Cancer and Hepatitis C.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The state government in a first of its kind scheme will provide interest free crop loans, worth Rs 50,000, to farmers, he said. In a historic decision all farmers would be provided a health insurance cover of Rs 50,000 and an insurance of Rs 5 lakh in case of accidental death or incapacitation of head of family, he added. Meanwhile, All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) today strongly condemned the terror attack in Uri sector in Jammu and Kashmir that left 18 jawans dead. AISSF has welcomed the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not letting those behind “the despicable and cowardly attack” go unpunished, the federation’s interim president Karnail Singh Peermohammad said.
The Federation extended condolences to the families of the jawans martyred in the terrorist strike, the deadliest attack on army since 2002."

(PTI Photo)
NO TRUCK from Pakistan crossed over to the Indian side at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) on the Attari-Wagah border on Thursday as no cash was available to pay labourers for loading and unloading of goods due to demonetisation. Labourers have been suffering the most as business between India and Pakistan has been affected at ICP ever since demonetisation was announced. The operations have almost come to a halt for the last one week.
Balwinder Singh, President, Group-A of labourers registered at ICP, said, “We have not been receiving payments for last two weeks. There is no currency to make payments to labourers. There are 1,433 registered labourers, who work at the ICP. One labourer earns between Rs 12,000 and 15,000 per month on an average. Rs 5-7 lakh are paid for labour everyday. It has become difficult for us to survive as there has been no cash to feed the families. Business had not stopped even when there was serious tension between India and Pakistan after Uri attack and border villages in Amritsar were ordered to vacate. It is very rare when no Pakistani truck crosses over to Indian side.”
He added, “Most of the business for labourers is generated from the trucks coming from Pakistan. Labourers are paid for unloading goods from the Pakistani trucks and loading them again on Indian trucks. Around 150 trucks come from Pakistan on normal days. But as labourers are not ready to work without cash, traders have been returning the goods truck from Pakistan as they don’t want to pay rent by keeping the goods in warehouse.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The number of trucks coming from Pakistan derceased gradually and today no truck came.” Private contractor, Punjab Container Service (PCS), makes payments to the labourers. PCS manager, Harbinder Singh, said, “Some labourers have not been paid for the last 15 days. We had asked the labourers to accept online payment but they were not ready for many reasons, including that it would waste their day to withdraw money from ATM or bank. Today was the day when no truck came.
We have convinced labourers to accept online transactions. We have been in negotiation with a private bank to facilitate the labourers. Bank has asked us to submit the identity proofs of the labourers to make arrangements for online transactions. Bank may issue them an ATM card, which would allow them to withdraw money.”
“We had no other option than accepting the proposal. But there are long queues at every ATM. Standing in queue would waste one labour day and it is not sure if we will be able to withdraw all our money at one time or not. So, we have accepted online payment as many of us have to buy food for families,” said Balwinder."

(AP Photo)
Terming “Indian aggression” as a threat to the entire region, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today warned that Pakistan is also capable of executing surgical strikes and will not allow anyone to “cast an evil eye” on it. Chairing a special Cabinet meeting to review the security situation in the country, Sharif said that Pakistan will take all necessary steps to protect its people and territorial integrity in case of any aggression or violation of the Line

of Control (LoC).

He said that Indian aggression constituted a threat to the entire region and Pakistan would take all measures to protect its territorial integrity, The Express Tribune reported. “No one will be allowed to cast an evil eye on Pakistan,” Sharif said, adding that Pakistan was fully capable of executing surgical strikes. “The nation is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the valiant armed forces to defend the motherland.” His comments came a day after India conducted surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC with the Army inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK. Pakistan has dismissed as “fabrication of truth” India’s claim and termed it as a “quest” by India to create media hype by rebranding cross-border fire as surgical strike.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sharif said that all steps would be taken to prevent LoC violations or aggression and added that Pakistan’s resolve to establish peace remained strong. He said the leadership and people of Pakistan are united in their resolve to counter any aggressive Indian designs, adding that Pakistan’s commitment for peace must not be construed as weakness. Sharif also raised Kashmir issue said that it was the “unfinished agenda of the partition”. He said that atrocities in Kashmir could not crush Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. “Indian atrocities” there are “unacceptable”, he said. Calling for a probe into the September 18 Uri attack, Sharif said blaming Pakistan for orchestrating the attack was beyond comprehension.

The Cabinet also joined the Prime Minister in completely rejecting the Indian claims of carrying out “surgical strikes”, Radio Pakistan reported. It condemned “Indian accusations in the wake of the Uri attack and pledged to expose India before the international community”. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that Pakistan does not want escalation of tension but is ready to meet any eventuality. Minister for Commerce Khurram Dastgir said India is creating artificial tension in its attempt to divert attention of the world from its atrocities against Kashmiris. He said Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands and the country would continue to raise voice for rights of Kashmiris.
Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Syed Riaz Hussain Pirzada regretted that instead of giving right of self-determination to Kashmiris, India is resorting to terrorism against Pakistan. He said the world community should take notice of India’s belligerence."

DMK on Satrurday lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Army for conducting surgical strikes across LoC in the wake of the Uri attack, saying it proved India’s ability to conduct such targeted strikes when required.
“On behalf of DMK, I congratulate the Indian Army for proving its capability to conduct such strikes and Prime Minister Modi for being instrumental for this,” DMK chief M Karunanidhi said. The surgical strikes also proved that the Indian Army will not tolerate every such attack, he said in a statement.
The Army’s action showed that India’s patience had its limits, he said. India had carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, seen as a reprisal for the Uri attack which left 19 Indian soldiers dead.

The Army Friday said Pakistani markings were found on grenades seized from four slain terrorists in Naugam sector of Kashmir on Thursday, confirming the complicity of the neighbouring country in abetting terrorism.
“Pakistan Ordinance Factory markings on hand grenades (ARGES 84) and UBGL grenades seized from the terrorists confirms Pakistan’s complicity in abetting terrorism,” an Army spokesman said.
“Pakistani markings are also seen on medicines and eatable items seized by the force,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Four terrorists were killed in a gun battle with the Army in Naugam sector on Thursday while they were trying to sneak into the Valley from Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. He said highly inflammable material, including six plastic explosive slabs, six bottles of petroleum jelly, six bottles of inflammable liquid and six lighters were also seized.
“Similar type of inflammable material was used at Poonch on September 11 and in the Uri attack on September 18. This shows the sinister design of Pakistan to aid terrorists is causing maximum destruction,” he added."

(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)
Days after criticising the government’s response to the Uri attack earlier this month, the Congress-led Opposition Thursday joined hands to back the Army’s “surgical strikes” on terrorist launchpads across the LoC, with some leaders expressing hope that there would be no further escalation in hostilities.
The Opposition’s reaction came after the government briefed an all-party meeting about last night’s operation, and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj drove across to 10, Janpath, at around 4 pm to brief Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The Congress chief has stayed out of public sight after being discharged from hospital in mid-August following an operation.

Hours after details of the strikes were revealed, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, along with five senior ministers, met leaders from various Opposition parties at his North Block office where they were briefed by DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The leaders, including Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, JD(U)’s Sharad Yadav, BSP’s S C Mishra and RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, were informed that the Army operation took place at two points across Kupwara and Poonch. No further operational details were shared. Yechury told The Indian Express that they were told that more details were being collected from troops returning back to their bases.
Sources said Yechury sought to know whether such terrorist launchpads were usually located so close to the LoC. The government clarified that while the terrorists’ camps were located deep inside, they had come near the LoC to cross into Indian territory.
Apart from Rajnath Singh, the leaders representing the government at the briefing were Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar, Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu, and Minister for Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan.
Over the last ten days, the Congress had been urging the government to respond strongly to Pakistan, trying in the process to build a narrative that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “was not walking the talk” on this issue.
But on Thursday, it backed the government fully. Sonia said in a statement that the party “stands with the government in its actions today to protect our country’s security and deal with the menace of terrorism from across the border”. She said that the strike was a “strong message that conveys our country’s resolve to prevent further infiltration and attacks on our security forces and our people”.
Congratulating the Army, she hoped that “Pakistan will recognise that it bears a great responsibility in the continuing cross-border terrorist attacks against India” and said that she expected Islamabad to take “effective action to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism that it has supported…”
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “All of us stand firmly united against terrorism and those who support and sponsor it. The Congress Party and I salute the Indian Army and our jawans for acting valiantly to defend our country and our people. Jai Hind.”
Former defence minister and senior Congress leader A K Antony told The Indian Express that the strike was “inevitable” since infiltration by terrorists trained by the Pakistan Army is continuing unabated. “Given the situation, it was an inevitable action. I congratulate the Army and the government. Pakistan should now stop sending terrorists into India. There is a limit to India’s patience.”
CPM general secretary Yechury hoped there would be no “further escalation in hostilities” and asked the government to “ensure the safety and security of our people from cross-border terrorism”.
Yechury also asked the government to continue “diplomatic and political moves to defuse tensions”. “We hope that now incidents like those at Pathankot and at Uri will not recur,” he said.
Naidu told reporters after the all-party briefing that “details were given by the DGMO about five-six places across the LoC along Kupwara to Poonch”. The troops involved in the operation were reaching their headquarters, and that some were returning from an altitude of 6,000 ft, he said.
“All political parties complimented the Indian Army enormously. They assured that they were totally with the government to face any situation. They were all very happy,” said Naidu.
“The feedback we are receiving is that the entire country is very happy about the swift action taken by the Indian Army,” he said.
While JD(U)’s Sharad Yadav said that “all parties spoke in one voice”, RJD’s Gupta said the leaders backed the government for “all actions being taken in the interest of the nation”.
However, former minister of state for defence and Congress leader M M Pallam Raju struck a note on caution while speaking to reporters in Hyderabad and asked the government not “pat its back” yet, as Pakistan was expected to retaliate.
“I think this is a good retribution. But at the same time, we have to be prepared. Let’s not pat ourselves on our backs. We should also be prepared for retaliation from their end,” said Raju."

Senior intelligence officials in Srinagar told The Indian Express that besides infiltration inputs for the Uri sector sent by them on September 12 and 13, a specific detailed intelligence alert had been generated by them on September 15 about a possible Fidayeen attack in the area.

The September 15 Intelligence Bureau alert was sent to all in the “crisis loop”, sources said, including the Army command units in the State. Significantly, the officials said the alert mentioned two specifics — that a possible fidayeen attack could be mounted and that it could be executed by a Pakistani border action team (BAT) positioned close to the LoC and waiting to infiltrate into Uri.

“Our alert was not about a possible skirmish…it mentioned a BAT being mobilised and Uri being the specific target,” a top official said. On Sunday morning, four fidayeen attacked the rear base of an Army regiment in Uri. Seventeen army personnel were killed in the attack, and the four terrorists were also eliminated.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh held a high-level meeting at his residence in New Delhi which was attended by top security officials from the home ministry as well as the defence ministry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that those behind the incident would not go unpunished."

More from the world of Entertainment:

 
During a light conversation between the two on stage, Rekha revealed, ” The first time you (Aishwarya) actually saw me was through your mother’s eyes. She (Aish’s mum) was pregnant and kept seeing my photos when she was pregnant and this is the result.”
However, Rekha immediately added, “just kidding”. The two actors were looking stunning.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On the work front, Aishwarya is all set for the release of her upcoming film Ae Dil Hail Mushkil. Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has been given U/A certificate by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and the film is set to release on October 28.
The movie has been produced by Fox Star Studios and Dharma Productions and stars Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.
“‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ has been cleared by the censor board and we are gearing up for its release on the 28th of October. Diwali is all about love and ‘Ae Dil….’ is all about spreading love,” Apoorva Mehta, CEO, Dharma Productions said in a statement.
In the aftermath of Uri attacks, the romantic drama has been embroiled in a controversy, with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) issuing an ultimatum to Fawad along with other Pakistani actors to leave India. The party has also threatened to stall the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil."

The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan following the Uri attack that killed 18 soldiers has gripped a majority of the population from both countries. Earlier this month, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) threatened Pakistani artists working in India to leave the country. The issue of the ban on Pakistani artists gained momentum after a lot of people from the industry and otherwise spoke for and against it. Staging a different kind of protest against Pakistan, comedian Varun Grover has called for a ban on ajwain (carom seeds) and sendha namak (rock salt) India imports from Pakistan.
In a series of sarcastic tweets, he said that the country imports the two from the neighbours whose “films & artists we’ve decided to hate”. He requested people to screenshot his tweets and make a forward message for all ‘true’ Indians. “While the soldiers are dying, we ignorant fools are eating kuttu ki tikkiyaan with PAKISTANI namak (how gaddaar we are!) & Ajwain. STOP NOW!” he tweeted. He also put a video burning ajwain to prove he actually boycotted it!
His tweets have garnered a massive response on social media. “and all the outlets of Karachi Halwa and Karachi bakery,” wrote a user.
Read his tweets here.

So this year, due to drought last 2 yrs, Indian farmers could not grow enough Ajwain. The staple herb which sells at INR 70/kg went to 300.

Adil Ashraf Akhoon had been the only student in his class, at a government school in north Kashmir, to choose “a different career path”. But a cricket match in 2014 would derail his dreams of becoming a video editor. Since then, the 22-year-old says, he has been left to lead a “restless life” at home in Baramulla’s Kreeri village, with little hope of entering a university again.
His day begins in the confines of his house and ends there. Sometime he goes out with his childhood friends, but mostly he spends his time “doing nothing” or helping out with household chores, he says.
Adil was among the nine students expelled by the administration of Swami Vivekanand Subharti University in Meerut in 2014 for celebrating Pakistan’s win over India in an Asia Cup cricket tie. The administration held that “their behaviour was not conducive to peace on the campus”, after Pakistan’s win sparked violence at the university.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A total of 67 Kashmiri students were suspended and sent home after the furore, but 58 of them were later allowed to resume studies. While the sedition charge against the Valley students was dropped in the absence of any evidence, a disciplinary committee found them guilty of misconduct.
Six of the nine who were eventually expelled secured admission at other universities, while two of them had to start their undergraduate degrees afresh. Adil was the only one whose career stalled.
Watch what else is making news:

The universities that offered him re-admission, such as AP Goyal Shimla University, wanted him to start his

undergraduate course once again, and he wasn’t ready to take the option. Adil had been in the final year of his

Bachelor’s in Journalism and Mass Communications course when he was expelled from the Meerut university.
“I cannot do anything now. I tried to get admission in many colleges and universities, but I faced rejection

everywhere,” says Adil. “A Kashmiri cannot move freely any way. My life is blemished forever. I think about it all the time and how much it has cost me.”
This year, there have been several attacks on Kashmiri students across the country, while some of them have also been arrested over social media posts. Earlier this month, four students were injured in a clash between Kashmiri students and others at a Ludhiana college, following tension that had been building over India-Pakistan sports matches, which came to a head after the Uri attack.
Adil says he had joined the journalism course with the desire to do something different, and had taken a chance with the decision to study outside J&K. “I couldn’t just shift from that and start studying something else. I went to the Meerut university too twice, and called the administration many times.”
Every time he hears or reads about the harassment faced by Kashmiri students in educational institutes outside the state, Adil says, he remembers that day of March 2, 2014, when his life changed.
“Everyone was watching the match on television silently that day, but when it became certain that Pakistan would

win, students supporting India began saying all kinds of things. We continued to remain silent, but at one point,

the abuses became intolerable and we had to react,” Adil says. “We asked the warden to switch off the television set to avoid tension, but he did not listen, and when Pakistan won, a fight broke out.”
The next day, the students were dropped at the Ghaziabad railway station and sent to Delhi, from where they travelled home. “We managed the travel cost somehow. There was not much money in our pockets. My family wouldn’t allow me to leave home for days after I returned,” he says.
Adil had been interning with a local television channel in Meerut when the cricket controversy broke, getting trained as a video editor. Two months after the episode, he was allowed to sit for his fourth-semester exam, but with a rider: he and the eight other expelled students were told that they would have to collect their migration certificates at the end of the examinations.
He cleared all the exams, he says.
Adil’s four siblings are all younger than him. One brother is an undergraduate student, while the other three are

in school. His father, who works as an embroider, and his mother want him to continue his education too. But, he

says, “my dreams have been killed”.
Adil is still in touch with his former classmates at the Meerut university, who were from the area. He says he

often visits them too, and stays at their homes. “It may have changed my life, but I still have my friends in

Meerut,” he says."

(Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi)
At a time when ties between India and Pakistan are strained, the Karvan-e-Aman, a bus service connecting Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, continued on Monday.
The bus hit the Srinagar-Baramulla-Muzaffarabad road despite a militant attack in Baramulla on Sunday evening, in which a BSF constable was killed.
This was the third trip of the bus since the Uri attack, which led to an escalation of tension between the two countries.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While only six passengers from Muzaffarabad travelled to the Valley on Monday, 20 passengers from Srinagar went to Muzaffarabad, in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).
Watch what else is making news:

“The bus left Srinagar early in the morning and crossed over normally,” Regional Passport Officer, Srinagar, Firdous Iqbal told The Indian Express. The RPO is the nodal officer for the bus service.
In fact, a day after the Uri attack on September 18, the Karvan-e-Aman was the only vehicle to cross the army’s brigade headquarters in Uri, where 19 soldiers were killed in the terror attack.
The bus service was launched as a confidence building measure between India and Pakistan on April 7, 2005, two years after the ceasefire was announced on the Line of Control. The bus service runs every Monday.
While the bus service has continued despite hostility between the two countries, especially in the wake of Mumbai attacks and the recent Uri attack, the number of passengers taking the bus has come down significantly over the years."

It didn’t look like an official statement. It seemed as if Karan Johar was coerced into accepting that he is not an anti-national. He had to prove his patriotism through this rather humiliating video.
Karan Johar never looked so compliant as he did in that two-minute video. I felt a little discomfited watching Karan Johar saying those lines in a well-rehearsed manner, a departure from his personality.
What is Karan Johar’s fault?

 
Johar is a filmmaker. He is into filmmaking business that goes beyond just profit-making. Films make an emotional connect with people. Why target only films? Because films have an ability to influence people (and potential vote bank) in a gigantic way.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
There hasn’t been a single statement or a stand from the ruling government regarding revoking visas of Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood. “There is no proposal to revoke the visa granted to Pakistani artistes working in India,” a senior home ministry official said a few days ago. There has also been no official announcement of suspending all cultural ties between India and Pakistan.
So why is a small political party that doesn’t even have a single elected Member of Parliament create such a ruckus? All this brouhaha about banning Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is coming from a party whose candidates forfeited their deposits on 203 out of the 288 seats in Maharashtra in the 2014 Assembly elections.
Even if we assume for a while that the MNS is really concerned, why doesn’t it infuse the same anger and retaliation into other issues? Mumbai turns into an open swimming pool during monsoons. Marathwada faced a severe drought this year. People from Marathwada region migrated to cities like Mumbai and Pune. Why didn’t MNS come out on roads to protest against these sensitive issues which affect people much more than a Fawad Khan film?
By the way, BMC’s elections are scheduled for February 2017.
Let’s leave aside the fact that Karan Johar is a creative person. Karan Johar is like any other entrepreneur who just happened to use a product from Pakistan when circumstances were normal. Just like retailers and wholesalers who are using made-in-China products. By the same logic, MNS should also vandalise shops of these retailers when there is a call for boycotting China products.
But films are an easy target. Aren’t they?
It is neither the first nor last time that our political leaders have succeeded in deviating our attention from ‘real’ issues and questions. That is not the point, though. The point is how easily they can do it to us every single time by targeting ‘art’. And how generously we allow them to do this to us.
We have made the likes of Karan Johar and Fawad Khan scapegoats for giving a very shallow, general solution to a complex problem. And that solution is boycott Pakistani actors and films, ban Indian films featuring Pakistani actors.
Pakistani film ‘Jago Hua Savera’ was dropped from MAMI festival. But what did it achieve at the end of the day? Once again we have allowed our leaders to escape from the responsibility by targeting ‘art’.
Even before the Uri attack, India and Pakistan had suspended cricket matches for some years now (even as hockey matches between two countries were going on). That didn’t, however, stop a Pathankot attack.
Art is a reflection of a country’s society. It gives one a glimpse into the creative freedom that an artiste enjoys in the country. The same goes for innovators and entrepreneurs.
Also read | Karan Johar budges under pressure over Ae Dil Hai Mushkil controversy
And Karan Johar seems such a nice, ‘perfect’ target. Karan is one rich celebrity who judges dance reality shows to earn money. He talks about love, loneliness and even depression. Karan Johar has no political affiliation. He doesn’t seem to have an opinion on political matters either.
Karan Johar just happens to be a normal citizen who is busy earning his livelihood like any one of us.
Sample this: Apple CEO Tim Cook defied a court order in the aftermath of a terrorist shooting in California, US. FBI wanted to see the data on the iPhone of one of the attackers but couldn’t get past Apple’s security features. So court asked Apple to create a software that would enable FBI to access the data. However, Cook refused, saying he is protecting Apple customers from hackers.
This is not to say that Karan Johar is Tim Cook, but to stress the difference in democratic rights that one enjoys in two different countries. While Cook decided to not cooperate with FBI in providing data of Apple customers seeking privacy concern as one of the reasons, we saw Karan Johar bowing down to political pressure. We are living in a time when having an opinion at once categorises one into having a – liberal, conservative, left-wing, right-wing, anti-national or nationalist influence or affiliation. Who cares about logic and reasons anyways?

 
Because it is easy to write 140 characters and prove one’s patriotism. Bashing people for having a different point of view has become fashionable.
Karan Johar is an influential entity in our society today. People love watching his movies and talk shows. At 44, he has managed to stay relevant. He also symbolises a free-spirited creative endeavour, something which New India could relate to.
What did he apologise for in that video? For making films, for casting a Pakistani actor in his film when circumstances between two countries were normal? By the same logic, our leaders should also prove their patriotism by apologising for a whole lot of scams, corruption, fake promises of bringing back black money and many other things.
Or was he apologising for being an ordinary citizen, doing ordinary stuff and having no opinion on the political atmosphere in the country? Or for being a filmmaker? Or for being just talented?"

(file photo/Express Photos by Gurmeet Singh)
The Indian Air Force doesn’t take into account human casualties but only the number of targets hit, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Monday, referring to the Balakot air strike.
Addressing the press in Coimbatore, Dhanoa said: “IAF is not in a postilion to clarify the number of casualties. The government will clarify that. We don’t count human casualties, we count what targets we have hit or not.”
The Air Chief’s remarks come a day after BJP president Amit Shah claimed that over 250 terrorists were killed in the IAF air strike deep inside Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“After the Uri attack, the army did a surgical strike. After the Pulwama attack, people said there could not be a surgical strike due to the high level of alertness. But on the 13th day, the Narendra Modi government carried out an air strike, and more than 250 terrorists were killed without suffering any losses,” Shah had said on Sunday.

In his first remarks since the February 26 attack on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot in Pakistan, Dhanoa said the Rafale jet should come into India’s inventory by September.
In response to a question regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that Rafale jets would have a made a difference, he said, “Honourable Prime Minister has made the statement. I will not comment on that.”
Referring to Pakistan using F-16 aircraft in its offensive against India last week, Dhanoa said, “I don’t know what is the end-user agreement between America and Pakistan. If the end-user agreement was that they will not use it for offensive purposes, then I think they have violated that end-user agreement.”
India, he said, has pieces of the AMRAAM missile which it displayed.  “Obviously, I think they have lost a F-16 aircraft in that combat. So, obviously, they have been using that aircraft against us,” he added.
Had the Indian Air Force dropped bombs in a jungle at Balakot there would have been no need for Pakistan to respond, he said.
“The target has been clearly amplified by the foreign secretary in his statement. And, of course, if we plan to hit the target, we hit the target. Otherwise, why would he (Pakistan) have responded,” he said.
Questioned about the use of the MiG 21 Bison, which was among the IAF aircraft used to repel the Pakistan fighter jets that violated Indian airspace, Dhanoa said: “The MiG-21 Bison is in our inventory, why not use it?…I will not comment on the ongoing operation because they are still ongoing. The Mig-21 Bison is a capable aircraft, it has been upgraded, it has better radar, air-to-air missiles and better weapons system… We fight with all the aircraft in the inventory. Remember the initiative is always with the adversary.”
When asked about the present situation on the border, he said: “It is an ongoing operation, I will not comment on it.”
On whether IAF wing commander Abhinandhan Varthaman would fly again, Dhanoa said: “Whether he flies again or not depends on his medical fitness. That’s why post-ejection, he has undergone medical check. Whatever treatment required, will be given. Once we get his medical fitness, he will get into fighter cockpit.”
Dhanoa was briefing the press after President Ram Nath Kovind was in Coimbatore to present the President’s Colours to Air Force Station, Hakimpet and 5 Base Repair Depot at the Air Force Station in Sulur.
The President said India is committed to peace but will use “all our might” to protect the nation if the need arises. He said the country’s valour was on display when, on February 26, the Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted pre-emptive air strikes on a terrorist camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot, Pakistan.
“India remains firmly committed to peace, but in case the need arises, we will use all our might to protect the nation,” the President said. “Our Armed Forces reflect our resolve. This valour was on display very recently, as the IAF carried out preemptive strikes on a terrorist camp."

Vicky Kaushal starrer Uri: The Surgical Strike is all set to hit the big screen on January 11. As the audience gets ready to see Kaushal in a new avatar, the film’s director Aditya Dhar opened up on the movie, its narrative and its male lead in an exclusive conversation with indianexpress.com.
Aditya Dhar has been at it for 12 years in the Hindi film industry. He has written songs (Kabul Express), scripts (Aakrosh, Boond) and has finally decided to plunge into filmmaking with Uri. But isn’t it a risky move to debut with such a sensitive subject? The director doesn’t think so.
“That risky move was actually for Ronnie, for me it was a no-brainer, because I was getting to do something that people don’t get a chance to do very often. Being a Kashmiri pandit, I have heard about terrorism since I was a kid and I always wanted to get into army. It is one of the most incredible stories. One of the best military operations that has happened here. So Uri was one story that had to be told,” Dhar said on the choice of subject.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

In fact, Uri has been written and directed by Dhar, who feels that things work in harmony if one person is in charge of both the departments. “When I am writing it, I am already visualizing the whole thing. So when I am writing for someone else, I am picturing something else, and the other person has another image in his head and so there is a lot of back and forth which happens. This is definitely not the case when you are the one who has written and directed the movie. You are more sure of things, the clarity is on another level; less confusion, you don’t cross the budget,” said the filmmaker.
“Also, when you have written the script yourself, you are more emotionally attached. It’s your film. You give it that extra push which is important,” he added.
Incidentally, Aditya Dhar was supposed to make his debut as a director with a movie called Raat Baaki featuring Pakistani heartthrob Fawad Khan and Bollywood star Katrina Kaif. But the movie had to be shelved following the Uri attack and the consequent surgical strike.
“Raat Baaki was supposed to go on floor in October-November 2016. And just before it was to hit the floor, the Uri attack took place, as a result of which, Pakistani artistes were banned, and while we were thinking of what could be our next strategy in terms of casting, the surgical strikes happened. And suddenly, I was like, ‘How did we pull this off (the strike)?’” said Dhar.

Seeing the trailer and a few lines uttered by its characters, one wonders if Uri will just be one more patriotic film from Bollywood, or will it seriously consider the aftermath of any war or battle and offer a balanced narrative which doesn’t pit one side against the other unnecessarily.
“When you watch the film, you will realize that both the Uri attack and the surgical strike that followed was about terrorists. It was never about Pakistan and its people. I am a filmmaker and I have no issues with anyone, I am a director and I am just here to tell a great story,” said the Uri director.
But then what about the language? Is it not problematic? “Ye naya Hindustan hai, ye ghar mein ghusega bhi aur marega bhi,” says Paresh Rawal’s character at one point in the trailer (This is a new India. We will enter their homes and we will not hesitate to kill them).
However, Dhar has a different take on the issue. The filmmaker said, “The only way to motivate soldiers is by pepping them up, talking to them and inspiring them. Now in that situation, in a battlefield, a commando will use that kind of language. It’s not us who is pulling the trigger, that army man is. And when he decides to do his job, he shouldn’t be in two minds about it.”
While war dramas usually have a packed audience lining for the ticket counter, come this Friday and we will possibly see more people than usual in theaters this weekend, all thanks to Uri’s lead actor’s talent.
Stating that Vicky was his first choice for the role, Aditya Dhar said, “Vicky had done only Masaan, Raman Raghav 2.0 and Zubaan when I reached out to him and thought he would fit the part wonderfully. I wanted a fantastic actor who was willing to dedicate himself to the character, prep for it for six-seven months and Vicky was the man.”"

For 12 long years, security forces believed they had wiped out the Jaish-e-Mohammad in Kashmir, eliminating its top leadership in a series of attacks. With its February 14 suicide attack killing 40 CRPF personnel, in one of Kashmir’s deadliest attacks ever, the terror outfit that has repeatedly brought India-Pakistan ties to the brink, has done it again.
Sheltered by Pakistan and protected by China, founder Maulana Masood Azhar — who has himself spent all of one month in Kashmir, back in 1994 — has now steered the Jaish through the 2001 Parliament attack, the January 2016 Pathankot air base attack, as well as the September 2016 Uri attack. The Jaish has introduced suicide missions to the Valley, as well as bombers driving explosives-laden vehicles, like in Thursday’s attack. In all the recent attacks in Kashmir, the Jaish is a suspect.

Its recent surge coincides with the Taliban coming forward for talks in Afghanistan, helped by Pakistan. The Jaish has close links with the Afghan Taliban, and the Kashmir attack sends a message to its negotiators, as well as the Taliban’s own men, at a time when it is seeking peace after years of war.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Security forces say the Jaish is now the third largest militant group operating in the Valley, behind the Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba. But it is behind most of Kashmir’s deadly attacks in the past two years. The loss of over 40 men, including several top commanders, in the past one year has hardly dented its strength.

Police records show 56 militants in its ranks in the Valley, most of them Pakistanis (33, compared to 23 locals). Twenty-one of these militants (19 of them foreign) operate in the three districts of North Kashmir. South Kashmir has around 35 Jaish militants, 21 of them locals. The Jaish is believed to have no presence in Srinagar, Budgam and Ganderbal districts in Central Kashmir.

In the re-emergence of the Jaish, police see a strategic bid by Pakistan to turn international scrutiny away from the Lashkar and Hizbul Mujahideen. Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed is among the most wanted in US list, with a $10 million bounty on his head.
“The reason for Jaish-e-Mohammad coming to the forefront (of militancy in valley) may be due to increased and repeated international scrutiny of LeT and its chief,” a secret police report compiled by its intelligence wing last year reads. “2017 witnessed heavy losses to terrorist outfits especially LeT and Hizb as their top commanders were killed. The Pakistan based handlers… have started reviving Jaish cadres in valley and main motive of carrying fidayeen type attacks is to push security forces on backfoot in order to give some breathing space to Hizb and LeT.”
Born in Bahawalpur in Pakistan Punjab, Masood Azhar had been part of the Harkat-ul-Ansar, which fought against the Russians in Afghanistan, before entering Kashmir. In January 2000, he was among the group of militants exchanged by the Vajpayee government as part of the Kandahar hijacking.

Soon after, he is believed to have founded the Jaish. A couple of months later, the Jaish marked its arrival in Kashmir with the Valley’s first ever human bomb a 17-year-old drove an explosives-laden Maruti car to the headquarters of the Army’s 15 Corps in Srinagar. The car exploded at the gate as the school boy from downtown Srinagar panicked and pulled a trigger too early. On Christmas Day the same year, the Jaish sent a 24-year-old British citizen driving another explosives-laden Maruti car to the 15 Corps headquarters. Eleven people, including five soldiers, were killed in that attack. A profile of the bomber subsequently appeared in the Jaish’s official publication, Zarb-e-Momin.
With these attacks, the Jaish underlined its difference with the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which had refrained from suicide attacks as suicide is prohibited in Islam.

In another difference with the Lashkar, the Jaish shared an umbilical cord with the Taliban. It would continue to retain it, to the embarrassment of Pakistan, even after Islamabad came under pressure following 9/11. The Jaish’s subsequent operations threatened to push India and Pakistan to war several times. In fact, the Jaish’s suicide attack on the J&K Assembly on October 1, 2001, less than a month after 9/11, was the first attack in Kashmir — 12 years after the start of militancy — that was officially condemned by Pakistan. The Pakistan Foreign Office used the term ‘terrorism’ to criticise it. Islamabad’s hand was forced not just by the death of 23 civilians in the incident, the largest number killed in a Kashmir attack, provoking outrage, but also because the Jaish identified the suicide bomber as a Pakistani, Wajahat Hussain.
The Jaish also lost backing within the Pakistani security establishment when its members carried out two assassination bids on then president Pervez Musharraf in 2003.

In India, the security forces coincidentally gained ground against the outfit by infiltrating its ranks. In early 2004, a mole deep inside the Jaish helped the security forces hit a meeting of its entire top brass in Lolab, killing all.
For more than a decade after that, the Jaish struggled to regain a foothold in Kashmir, even as it kept losing men. In March 2011, its Kashmir chief, Sajad Aghani, was killed along with his associate Omar Bilal on the banks of the Dal Lake. Three months later, another mole helped security forces kill a Jaish commander.
Afghani was succeeded by Qari Yasir, a Pakistani, but he was killed in an encounter in Lolab Kupwara in July 2013. After Yasir, Adil Pathan became the Jaish chief in the Valley, but was killed along with associate Abdul Rehman, a Myanmarese, at Tral in October 2015. Pathan was the brother of the Jaish’s Pakistan-based operations chief, Mufti Asghar.

The Jaish tried to indigenise and formed a Kashmir group headed by a local, Altaf Baba. But in July 2013, Altaf Baba was killed, again after police received precise inputs.
In November 2015, after a long gap, the Jaish claimed responsibility for a major attack — on a Brigade headquarters at Tangdhar next to the Line of Control in Kupwara, killing a civilian. It attributed it to its ‘Afzal Guru Squad’. But both the Army and the J&K Police doubted Jaish claims.
Security forces believe what marked the Jaish revival in Kashmir was the infiltration of two of its groups, through Kupwara and Poonch, in August 2016 during the protests that followed Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani’s assassination.
The local commander most crucial to the Jaish revival was the Valley’s 3-foot-tall militant, Noor Muhammad Tantray alias Noor Trali. Believed to be a close associate of Jaish commander Gazi Baba, the alleged mastermind of the Parliament attack, he was arrested in 2003 for the attack, and sentenced to life in 2011. He was out on parole when he rejoined militancy. Trali was named in several major Jaish attacks in the Valley after taking over its command in South Kashmir. Sources said Trali remained in close contact with security agencies while working clandestinely for the Jaish — a fact claimed by the Jaish in a book on Trali.
In December 2017, the 47-year-old was killed in an operation in Pulwama.
Trali was replaced by Mufti Waqas, a Pakistani militant and close associate of Masood Azhar, as the Jaish’s operations chief. Waqas, according to the Army, masterminded the attack on the Sunjuwan Army camp in Jammu in February 2018, in which six soldiers were killed.
Sources said that along with Trali, Waqas was the one who organised an ‘Afzal Guru Squad’ and set up a network of local recruits. In 2017, Masood Azhar sent his own nephew Talha Rashid to work under Waqas — underlining that he was ready to shed blood of one of his own for the revival of the outfit. Rashid was killed in an encounter in October 2017.
In March 2018, Waqas was killed in Awantipora.
By then though, thanks to the local network set up by Trali and Waqas, Jaish-led attacks had returned to the Valley. Security agencies name Waqas as the brains behind the attacks at Pulwama (August 27, 2017, killing eight security personnel), on the BSF’s 182 Battalion outside Srinagar airport (October 3, 2017, killing a BSF officer), and on a CRPF training camp in Lethpora (December 31, 2017, killing five CRPF men).
The Lethpora attack was carried out by a Class 10 student and the son of a policeman from Tral, Fardeen Ahmad Khanday, and a local taxi driver, Manzoor Ahmad Baba. Fardeen was the first Kashmiri youngster to be part of a suicide squad in seven years.
By the end of 2018, the Jaish had introduced another dimension to the Kashmir conflict: sniper attacks. In October 2018, when security forces eliminated a Jaish sniper squad, its top commander turned out to be another nephew of Azhar, Usman Haider.
Through it all, the one person who has stayed out of the reach of the authorities is 50-year-old Masood Azhar.

One of the 11 children of a government school headmaster, who was highly religious, Azhar had his first brush with the Harkat-ul-Ansar (earlier called the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen) at a Karachi madrasa where his father admitted him. In his book The Virtues of Jehad, Azhar writes about this. Azhar went on to become a teacher at the madrasa, many of whose students subsequently joined the Afghan jehad, including him.
While Azhar failed to complete his 40-day military training at a Harkat camp at Yavar in Afghanistan, he still joined the war against the Russians. After he was injured, the Harkat made him head of the ‘Department of Motivation’. Azhar soon grew close to Maulana Fazlur-Rehman Khalil, the head of Pakistan’s Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam (JUI), whose religious schools nurtured both the Harkat and Taliban. Azhar became the general secretary of the Harkat and was viewed as its best orator. Through the Harkat, he became active in Kashmir.
When he did come to the Valley, in January 1994, Azhar had a brief assignment — to patch up the Harkat’s factions of Harkat-e-Jehadi Islami and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Unlike most militants, he did not cross the LoC. Instead, he flew into New Delhi from Dhaka posing as a Gujarat-born Portuguese national, Wali Adam Issa. He checked into a hotel, and from there left for Deoband with two Harkat men from Kashmir. Later, he flew to Srinagar and met the Harkat’s top commanders, Sajjad Afghani and Amjad Bilal.
On February 10, 1994, he was held by the security forces along with Afghani at Khanabal.
The Harkat made several unsuccessful attempts to get the two out before the Kandahar hijacking, including kidnapping five Western trekkers in South Kashmir in 1995 and a jail break attempt in 1999. Afghani was killed in 1999 allegedly in a jail uprising. Azhar’s release following the kidnapping firmly established his links with the Taliban.
After his release, Azhar first tried to create a conglomerate of all jihadi groups. He finally created the Jaish out of Harkat cadre loyal to him, after differences with Maulana Khalil.
Following the December 13, 2001, attack on Indian Parliament, Delhi handed over a list of 20 men it wanted from Islamabad, with Azhar at the top. Pakistan arrested Azhar, but released him in December 2002, curtailing his activities and forcing him to stay low key.
He lost much of the goodwill within the Pakistani security establishment when he carried out an attack on the life of Musharraf on December 14, 2003. Azhar had been a vocal opponent of Musharraf for his alliance with the US following 9/11.
The Jaish hand in the July 2007 Lal Masjid episode, which saw the deadliest battle between the Pakistani army and homegrown militants since Pakistan tied up with the US post the World Trade Center attacks, further isolated it.
Though New Delhi has always wanted Azhar, the US too wants him for own reasons. The primary reason being the ‘link’ between Azhar and Sheikh Omar, who was released along with him during the Kandahar hijack and is now in jail after being given death for the killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl. The US hopes to learn more about Sheikh’s involvement in financing the 9/11 attacks.
The Americans also want to find out the extent of Azhar’s links with the al-Qaeda. A former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden, Abu Jandal, has recounted a “lavish” party the al-Qaeda founder threw for Azhar after his release in Kandahar.
Any international action against Azhar, however, has been blocked by China, which has refused to let him be proclaimed as an international terrorist by the United Nations. On Friday, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, while condemning the deaths of the CRPF men, it repeated this stance."

Respect.
While the rest of the world is debating whether to ban Pakistani actors or not, Akshay Kumar has shown what patriotism is really about. The actor, whose father was in the army, has donated Rs 9 lakh to the family of a martyred BSF jawan, according to reports.
The jawan succumbed after being targeted by Pakistani snipers. he was part of the team that foiled a major infiltration bid in Jammu and Kashmir. Akshay’s spokesperson is yet to confirm the reports.
This is not the first time that Akshay has donated to the army. In August, Akshay had donated Rs 80 lakh to the army. Speaking about his action, he had said then, “They are decorated with lot of medals and that is good. But I looked at their faces. The samman was required for them but they need money too. You have to be practical. I thought how about giving them money and that is when I decided to give 5 lakhs to each family.”

He would wake me up at 5 am and take me for jogging with him. I was always early to bed and early to rise.”"

India will take its drive to isolate Pakistan and rally the international community against cross-border militancy to a summit of emerging market powers this weekend, when it hosts BRICS nations in the western state of Goa.
For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the gathering of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa offers an opportunity to highlight the threat he sees to Indian security from recent frontier clashes with Pakistan.

But across the summit table at a resort hotel, Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to have much interest in casting Beijing’s alliance with Pakistan into doubt.
The final summit declaration is expected to repeat earlier condemnations of “terrorism in all its forms”, say diplomats and analysts, but avoid levelling blame over tensions between the nuclear-armed South Asian rivals.
Such discussions will make security a dominant issue at the eighth annual summit of the group, even as leaders also address core themes such as the global economy, financial cooperation and mutual trade.
“We will be looking at the global economic and political situation, and obviously terrorism is a very important part of that,” Amar Sinha, the Indian foreign ministry official responsible for the BRICS file, told a pre-summit briefing.

Not Just A “Jolly Partner”
Where Modi and Xi may see eye to eye, at least privately, is in a shared desire for Islamabad to restrain Islamist militants who, in Beijing’s view, pose a threat to China’s plans to build a $46 billion trade corridor that runs through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea.
“Contrary to the public messaging in Islamabad, China is not the perpetual jolly partner when it comes to its relations with Pakistan,” said Michael Kugelman, a senior program associate at the Wilson Center in Washington who focuses on South Asia.
“With China’s investments and economic assets growing in Pakistan, it’s only natural that it would worry. All militants, whether ‘good’ or ‘bad’ as characterised by Pakistan, threaten stability and by extension China’s economic interests.”
In addition to launching what it described as cross-border “surgical strikes” against suspected militants in Pakistan, in response to a Sept. 18 attack on an army base that killed 19 Indian soldiers, New Delhi has mounted a diplomatic offensive to isolate Islamabad.
Pakistan has denied any part in the attack on the Uri army base, near the de facto border that runs through the disputed territory of Kashmir. It also denies any “surgical strikes” took place, saying there was only border firing that is relatively common along the frontier.
Islamabad says India has exploited the incident to divert attention from its own security crackdown on protests sparked by the killing of a popular separatist militant leader.
More than 80 civilians have been killed and thousands wounded in India’s part of Kashmir, and a widespread curfew has been imposed.
Expressions Of Support
After the Uri attack, India quickly won expressions of support from the West and from Russia, whose President Vladimir Putin will also hold a bilateral summit with Modi in Goa.
China, for its part, has shown public restraint.
Zhao Gancheng, director of South Asia studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said that China and Pakistan were paying close attention to security threats to the trade corridor.
“If Pakistan’s security situation does not improve, it will obstruct some of these projects – especially infrastructure ones,” said Zhao. “In this sense, cooperation on counter-terrorism is very close.”
India has already engineered the collapse of a South Asian regional summit to have been hosted by Pakistan, and the Goa gathering will also feature an outreach session to countries from the Bay of Bengal region that could emerge as an alternative focus of regional cooperation.
Working Groups
BRICS leaders will support plans agreed by their national security advisers to create three working groups to cooperate on cyber security, counter-terrorism and energy security, said Sinha, the Indian foreign ministry official.
But diplomats and analysts say that India’s long-held ambition of joining the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a club of nuclear-trading nations, is unlikely to progress at Goa with China yet to soften its blocking stance.
And, despite concerns about militancy within Pakistan, China has rebuffed India’s calls for the United Nations to designate Maulana Masood Azhar, leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammed group that India blames for recent cross-border attacks, as a terrorist.
China recently extended a so-called “hold” on the designation by a further three months.
That reflects an evolving rivalry between the world’s two most populous nations in which, under Modi, India is seeking to close huge economic and military gaps and is shifting away from traditional non-alignment and seeking a closer partnership with the United States.
At the same time, China is expanding its economic and strategic reach into the Indian Ocean region, with Xi visiting Bangladesh on Friday en route to Goa where he is expected to sign loans worth $24 billion.
“Overall, it will be an awkward summit,” said Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
* He added that, for India, “diplomatic isolation of Pakistan will be the most important objective.”"

Gangasagar, South 24 Parganas (Bengal)
“I will never let any member from my family join the Army again. No money can compensate this loss. Can money bring my brother back?” wails 20-year-old Bulti Ghorai, sister of Sepoy Biswajit Ghorai.
She is seated in their mudhouse in a remote part of Gangasagar in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district. The road to the house has no lights.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Father Rabindranath Gorai says proudly, “Martyrs never die. I have lost my son. I don’t know how we will live, but I must say that I am proud. I know he died for the nation.”
Biswajit, the youngest of two brothers and a sister, had joined the Army 26 months ago. Two of his cousins were in the armed forces and that had inspired him to follow suit. The Ghorai family had mortgaged the little land they had to fund Biswajit’s education and his application for a job in the forces. Biswajit was in the first year of his college when he got the call. The family hoped it would be an end to their financial troubles. Soon after joining Army, he had bought sister Bulti a cellphone. On the same phone, she received the news of his death.
Biswajit was first posted in Bihar. After receiving the order of his new posting at Uri, he had come home for a month-long leave. He left for Uri on August 21. Initially, the family was worried about his posting in Uri, but his last call on Saturday left them relieved. He sounded happy. His body has not reached home yet.

“The government should act against Pakistan. If they don’t, no one will let their near-and-dear ones join the Army,” says Biswajit’s maternal uncle Satyanarayan Pradhan."

According to one of the organisers, not only visas but permissions are also not likely to be given to the Pakistani artists and they are prepared to go ahead with showcasing only the Indian collections. “There are only few stalls of Pakistan. So if they don’t get visas, we will display our Indian collection only,” said Gagan, one of the organisers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another member of the organisation, Jitender, said that they held back the hoardings due to this reason.
“We have even held back our hoardings as of now due to the lack of permissions. Otherwise, there is no threat here in Chandigarh but we have already decided that if permissions are not given, we will go ahead with our Indian stalls. There are about 15 Pakistani stalls and 70 Indian stalls,” he said.
Activist Ajay Jagga has also written to the UT Administration “to review the scenario in respect of the upcoming Indo-Pak exhibition Riwaaz” when already such an event has been cancelled in Delhi.

“The Pakistan High Commission has cancelled the Aalishan Pakistan exhibition, which was to be held later, owing to the strained Indo-Pak ties in the wake of terrorist attack in Uri. It has said that the environment in India is not conducive for events like Aalishan Pakistan exhibition, and thus the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan has called it off. In the backdrop of cancellations of an exhibition by Pakistan High Commission of India and Pakistan’s Trade Development Authority, it is requested that the situation in Chandigarh too should be reviewed,” stated the letter by Jagga.
He added, “It seems the organisers are either not aware or keeping the commercial interests above all and ignoring the present tense situation between the two nations. Now when the neighbouring country has cancelled a similar event on their own, citing the reasons as “atmosphere not conducive” then the organisers of such an event too should be asked to reconsider the event and administration should also assess the situation in Chandigarh for such an exhibition in the present scenario.”"

The 19th SAARC Summit to be hosted by Pakistan in November is likely to be postponed with India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan – four of the eight members of the South Asian grouping – deciding to pull out, citing incitement of terrorism in the region.
Sources in Nepal, the current Chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, confirmed having received messages from the four countries conveying their inability to attend the summit due in Islamabad on November 9-10.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The sources said that the Himalayan nation is yet to take a decision on calling off the summit, which is over a month away. With the SAARC process based on consensus, even if one member does not attend the summit is automatically postponed or cancelled.
However, a final decision rests on the current SAARC Secretary General Arjun Bahadur Thapa, who is currently in New York and will return in two days.
With half of the eight-nation regional bloc deciding to skip the event, there is every possibility of the event being postponed, in a big diplomatic snub to Pakistan.
Sri Lanka has already said that the SAARC Summit would not be possible without India’s participation.
India on Tuesday announced that it was pulling out of the Islamabad summit in the wake of the September 18 cross-border terror attack on an Indian Army base in Uri town of Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi has blamed on terrorists based in Pakistan.
The Uri attack came amid the dragging unrest and violence in Kashmir Valley that has left around 90 people dead since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani on July 8.
In a statement on Tuesday, India said increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of Saarc member-states “by one country” have created an environment that was not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th Saarc summit.
Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that India has conveyed to Nepal its decision not to attend the summit, for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to go.
“India remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in an atmosphere free of terror.
“In the prevailing circumstances, the Government of India is unable to participate in the proposed summit in Islamabad,” he said in the statement.
However, unfazed by India and three other member nations deciding not to participate in the grouping’s summit, Pakistan has said it will go ahead and host the event in November. Foreign Office Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria said Pakistan will host the 19th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in November.
Zakaria was quoted as saying that it was learnt from the Indian External Affairs Ministry’s tweet that India is not going to participate in the SAARC Summit, a decision he called “unfortunate”. “While we have not received any official communication in this regard, the Indian announcement is unfortunate,” he said.
In its message to Nepal on Tuesday, Afghanistan said that because of “increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, President of Afghanistan Mohammad Ashraf Ghani with his responsibilities as the Commander in Chief will be fully engaged, and will not be able to attend the summit”.
In a similar message to Nepal, Bangladesh said: “The growing interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country has created an environment which is not conducive to the successful hosting of the 19th Saarc Summit in Islamabad in November 2016.”
“Bangladesh, as the initiator of the Saarc process, remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in a more congenial atmosphere,” the message said.
“In view of the above, Bangladesh is unable to participate in the proposed summit in Islamabad.”
Bhutan, in its message, cited “the recent escalation of terrorism in the region” as the reason for its non-participation."

Pakistan High Commissioner in India Abdul Basit has reportedly received “threat calls” on Thursday, asking him to leave India. Quoting Pakistan High Commission sources, Geo News said the threatening calls were from an unknown number and the caller asked Basit that “it is better for you to return to your country”.
This comes amid a heated debate between the two neighbours over the Indian Army carrying out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) to neutralise terrorists waiting to infiltrate into the Indian territory.

India on Thursday announced that it conducted surgical strikes yesterday night and destroyed many terror bases across the LoC, while Pakistan rubbished the claim saying that there was only a cross-border firing that killed two of its soldiers.
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Jaishankar summoned Basit and presented him with evidence of the Uri attack having origins in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Basit was informed that probe agencies have identified one of the four terrorist who attacked an Army camp in Uri. The details of two guides, both hailing from PoK, were also shared. Jaishankar also told the Pakistan envoy that cross-border attacks were unacceptable and the country must mend its ways."

PRIME MINISTER Narendra Modi on Sunday said the government had adopted “a new policy” to act against terrorism and had realised that “enough is enough”. He said it was the government’s responsibility to live up to the expectations of the families of the personnel killed in the line of duty.
“For many decades, the country and numerous families have suffered the wounds and pain given by terrorism, Naxalism and insurgency. What happened in Pulwama and Uri was heartbreaking. We cannot bear this pain for eternity. Enough is enough,” the Prime Minister said during an event to commemorate the Golden Jubilee year of the Central Industrial Security force (CISF) at Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh.
The event had several union ministers and top security officials in attendance.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In an apparent reference to the IAF strike on terror camps after the Pulwama attack, he said that following dastardly acts of terrorist violence, his government has taken some strong decisions.
“Someone, sometime, has to take a big decision (against such terror acts)… it is my privilege that with the support of the crores of people of this country, we took some strong decisions,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister also said that his government was doing everything possible to help the forces. “Our government is purchasing all modern gadgets required by our security forces to tackle such challenges,” he said, mentioning the creation of a new facility in UP’s Amethi to manufacture modern guns.
Praising the CISF in protecting vital installations, he said, “When your neighbour is hostile. When it has no capacity to fight a war and when conspirators within the country get inspiration and support from there… Terrorism exhibits itself in various forms. To protect installations and infrastructure amid such challenges is a huge task.”
He also took potshots at VIPs, and in particular politicians. Calling the “VIP culture” a road block to security, Modi said, “The biggest roadblock to your (CISF’s) service are people like me; people from my community who think of themselves as VIPs. They throw a fit when stopped for frisking. …VIPs should think ki wo aapki aarti utar raha hai. Garv kijie. Cooperate with soldiers. VIP culture sometimes becomes a challenge for security.”
Modi also reminded the gathering of the government’s commitment towards remembering those killed in action. “I feel emotionally from heart that those in khaki have not got the respect and recognition they deserve. So, first time after Independence, a PM advocated the martyrdom of 35,000 personnel. It is important to boost the morale of the forces, give them respect. It is for this that the police memorial was built,” he said.
The national police memorial and the war memorial had to wait to come up since Independence, he said, adding “probably my turn was being awaited” for the last 70 years to unveil these important places.
This is the first time Modi attended the Raising Day event of any Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) since he took charge in 2014. Raised in 1969, the CISF has about 1.56 lakh personnel in its ranks at present.
He asked the CISF to “monitor and study in realtime global trends and techniques of terrorism” so that a better preparedness is ensured against. He also directed the force to install “digital museums” or electronic walls at airports so that the people get to know about CISF’s history, role and its expectations from the citizens."

(Source: Reuters)
WHILE INDIA called Pakistan the “mothership” of terrorism and said “terrorism has become its favourite child”, the Goa declaration on Sunday betrayed divisions within the five-nation BRICS grouping on terrorism, especially emanating from Pakistan.
For one, the Goa declaration did not mention “cross-border terrorism” — a term used to describe Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.
WATCH VIDEO: ‘No Mention Of Uri Attack In BRICS Goa Declaration’https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


It also did not name any Pakistan-based terrorist groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba, in the statement, whereas it named Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Syria’s Jubhat al-Nusra.
Two, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi, through his three statements on Sunday, tried to name and shame Pakistan, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “political solutions” to “regional hotspots” in a reference to the need for dialogue between India and Pakistan.

Russian President Vladimir Putin did not make any reference to terrorism in his statement.
MEA’s Secretary (economic relations) Amar Sinha, one of the leading negotiators from India, said that Pakistan-based terror outfits were not mentioned specifically since they affected only India, not the other BRICS countries. “I guess it doesn’t concern them…since these groups don’t attack them, we are affected by these Pakistan-based groups…PM made those statements as an injured party, others worded them differently,” he said.

On the phrase “cross-border terrorism” not being used, he said “ideas” and “concepts” pertaining to cross-border terrorism were mentioned, and pointed out a sentence — “We recall the responsibility of all states to prevent terrorist actions from their territories.”
Sinha’s statement that these groups affected only India is in contrast to New Delhi’s attempts, over the last few weeks, to underline that Pakistan-based terrorism affects not just India, but the region and the entire world. In fact, that was the genesis of the phrase “Ivy League of terrorism”, used by India to describe Pakistan at the United Nations recently.

The contradictions within the BRICS grouping were evident, even though the PM said the BRICS leaders were unanimous in their view about terrorism.
“We also agreed that those who nurture, shelter, support and sponsor such forces of violence and terror are as much a threat to us as the terrorists themselves,” he said, at the conclusion of the BRICS summit.
Earlier in the day, Modi said that “selective approaches” to terrorists and their outfits are “futile and counter-productive”. “There must be no distinction based on artificial and self-serving grounds,” he said, a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping remained firm on blocking India’s bid to get JeM chief Masood Azhar designated as an international terrorist by the UN.

Xi, in his 10-minute speech, too did not hold back. In an oblique reference to Kashmir, he talked about the need to find a “political solution” to “regional hotspots”. He also called for concrete efforts and multi-pronged approach that address both “symptoms and root causes” to global challenges like terrorism — an argument that is in tune with Pakistan’s position on Kashmir.
“We need to confront global challenges together. We, BRICS countries, share a common future. We are not only a community of convergence interest, but take concerted actions and make progress together. It is imperative that we step up coordination and communication on major international issues and regional hotspots and act in concert to find political solution to hotspot issues and take on such global challenges like natural disasters, climate change, infectious diseases and terrorism,” he said.

“While speaking with one voice in calling for greater international input, we should also address issues on the ground with concrete efforts and multi-pronged approach that addresses both symptoms and root causes,” said the Chinese President.
The sessions on Sunday began with Modi targeting Pakistan and calling it the “mothership” of terrorism. “In our own region, terrorism poses a grave threat to peace, security and development. Tragically, the mothership of terrorism is a country in India’s neighbourhood. Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership. This country not just shelters terrorists. It nurtures a mindset. A mindset that loudly proclaims that terrorism is justified for political gains. It is a mindset that we strongly condemn. And against which we, as BRICS, need to stand and act together. BRICS must speak in one voice against this threat,” said Modi at the inaugural session of the BRICS summit.
A couple of hours later, while making the country’s statement at the BRICS leaders’ session, his message was meant for both Pakistan and China. “Our response to terrorism must, therefore, be nothing less than comprehensive. And we need to act both individually and collectively. Selective approaches to terrorist individuals and organisations will not only be futile but also counter-productive.There must be no distinction based on artificial and self-serving grounds,” he said.
His comment on “artificial and self-serving grounds” was a clear indication of India’s disappointment with Beijing over the Masood Azhar issue. China recently put a “technical hold”, once again, on designating Azhar — accused in the Pathankot attack in January this year and the Parliament attack in 2001 — as an international terrorist at the UN.

“Criminality should be the only basis for punitive action against the individuals and organisations responsible for carrying out terrorist acts. Terrorist funding, their weapons supply, training and political support must be systematically cut off,” Modi said.
Later, while addressing the BIMSTEC summit in the evening, he said that in South Asia and BIMSTEC, “all nation states, barring one, are motivated to pursue a path of peace, development and economic prosperity for its people. Unfortunately, this country in India’s neighbourhood…embraces and radiates the darkness of terrorism.”
“Terrorism has become its favorite child. And, the child in turn has come to define the fundamental character and nature of its parent. The time for condemning the state-sponsored terrorism is long gone. It is time to stand up and act, and act decisively. It is, therefore, imperative for BRICS and BIMSTEC to create a comprehensive response to secure our societies against the perpetrators of terror,” he said.
“To those who nurture the philosophy of terror, and seek to de-humanise mankind, we must send a clear message to mend their ways or be isolated in the civilised world,” he said.

But, with differing views of other BRICS countries, particularly China and Russia, the five expansive and strongly-worded paragraphs on terrorism in the 109-para Goa declaration, did not mention the Uri attack.
Indian officials, however, took comfort in the fact that it called upon all countries to work together to “expedite” the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UNGA “without any further delay”.
This was something that National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval had impressed upon his BRICS counterparts to put back on the agenda, as it had been dropped in the Ufa declaration of 2015. CCIT had been mentioned in the BRICS statement in 2014.
The Goa declaration made a reiteration of the condemnation of terrorism, a practice followed in Ufa as well. “We strongly condemn the recent several attacks, against some BRICS countries, including that in India. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and stress that there can be no justification whatsoever for any acts of terrorism, whether based upon ideological, religious, political, racial, ethnic or any other reasons. We agree to strengthen cooperation in combating international terrorism both at the bilateral level and at international fora,” the Goa declaration said.
“To address the threat of chemical and biological terrorism, we support and emphasise the need for launching multilateral negotiations on an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism, including at the conference on disarmament. In this context, we welcome India’s offer to host a conference in 2018 aimed at strengthening international resolve in facing the challenge of the WMD-terrorism nexus,” the declaration said.

“We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, which should include countering violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, radicalisation, recruitment, movement of terrorists including foreign terrorist fighters, blocking sources of financing terrorism, including through organised crime by means of money-laundering, drug trafficking, criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the Internet including social media by terror entities through misuse of the latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Successfully combating terrorism requires a holistic approach. All counter-terrorism measures should uphold international law and respect human rights,” it said.
“We acknowledge that international terrorism, especially the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh) and affiliated terrorist groups and individuals, constitute a global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security. Stressing UN’s central role in coordinating multilateral approaches against terrorism, we urge all nations to undertake effective implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and reaffirm our commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter terrorism framework. We call upon all nations to work together to expedite the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN General Assembly without any further delay. We recall the responsibility of all states to prevent terrorist actions from their territories,” the declaration said."

Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt will get candid with Karan Johar on the show.
Shah Rukh Khan is back in India and like everything else, he did it with a bang. Ending weeks of speculation whether SRK will be on the opening episode of Koffee With Karan, the actor took to Twitter to share a picture from the sets. He is flanked by host Karan Johar and Dear Zindagi co-star Alia Bhatt in the image.
Along with the image, SRK wrote, “Some work days r not work. They r love and happiness. Thx Koffee team for having me over. Have a great season again!”

This year’s Koffee With Karan has been exactly like the director’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil — in the centre of a million rumours. It began with the news that Karan has replaced his favourite SRK with Fawad Khan as the first guest. Then the tension between India and Pakistan escalated after Uri attacks and Fawad was firmly out of the picture. It was then back to SRK.

Alia also seems to be Karan’s lucky charm these days. While earlier Kajol was the obvious choice for Koffee, now it seems to be Alia. She is also playing a guest appearance in ADHM. SRK and Alia will be seen together in Dear Zindagi. Two teasers from the film are already out and we love the chemistry the duo has. Guess we will see more of the same on Koffee With Karan, with an added shot of Karan himself. And just to remember how great he can be, here’s a Koffee mashup presented by Karan himself.

In the wake of Nagrota terror attack, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Friday admitted that there is scope for improvement in security as some “sort of lethargy” has set in over a period of time and said those behind any “lapse” will pay for it. The Minister also said that the recent surgical strike has led to a sense of “uncertainty” in the Pakistani security establishment and it was also a good confidence building measure for India.
Replying to queries on security arrangements at army camps, Parrikar said, “I think we can definitely improve upon it. Probably, over a period, some sort of lethargy has set in. Relaxation, it is obvious… it is taking some time.” He was asked if there was something that should have been done or can be done in the security arrangements in the wake of militants storming the complex of 166 artillery unit of Army at Nagrota on Tuesday. Seven security personnel, including two officers, were killed in the incident which witnessed a fierce gunbattle and a hostage-like situation at the army camp, considered to be a peace posting in the Army parlance.

Parrikar, who was speaking at HT Leadership Summit, said it is “very painful” to see soldiers die but they needed to save children and families. “I think we need to think out of the box. I am very sure that Army is aware of it and working on it,” he said. Asked about his earlier stress on fixing responsibility, Parrikar said even if he does a mistake, he will “have to pay for it”.
“Even if there are lapses, they need to be tackled properly. You cannot afford lapses,” the Minister said. Parrikar spoke about the need to use smart technologies for perimeter protection of sensitive bases but said infrastructure cannot be created overnight. He indicated that lengthy army procedures were coming in the way of getting things done swiftly. Asked if India could carry out more surgical strikes, Parrikar said the “principle of uncertainty” should be allowed to operate. “It will be beneficial to all of us.”
He said that surgical strikes have introduced a degree of uncertainty. “Obviously, uncertainty itself creates decision-making bottlenecks. You will never know them.” The surgical strike were carried out in retaliation to the September 18 Uri attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead.

“Earlier, one thing was sure that India won’t cross (Line of Control). Now that is one thing that’s missing. In strategy and such kind of issues, you need to put uncertainty in their minds. That has been achieved,” said Parrikar.

The minister said the operation has also left the nation satisfied. “It was a continuous insult to be treated like this…someone comes, hits us and we can’t do anything,” he said. The Minister said he had taken the initiative for the army to experiment with three to four types of fences on pilot basis but “they have massive procedures”. Following this, he has now asked the Defence Research and Development Organisation to experiment with smart solutions to secure military bases.
“The DRDO has been asked to try fences of different kinds – microwave, laser, smart fence that can pick vibration and CCTV cameras that can pick movement at one kilometre,” he said."

(File photo)
In a clear message to the Kashmiri separatists, BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said the central government will not have talks with those who do not believe in the Indian Constitution but those who consider themselves Indians. Acknowledging that the situation in the valley has been worrisome for last few months, he said, “if anybody thinks that Kashmir could be separated from India, then it is nothing but a daydream which will never come true.”
In his inaugural address at the party’s National Council meeting in Kozhikode, he also invoked the party’s ‘garib kalyan’ agenda, saying the central government has been dedicated to the development of the poor since Narendra Modi took oath as the Prime Minister. He said the next one year will be observed as ‘garib kalyan year’. With the Prime Minister and other senior leaders listening, Shah devoted most of his speech to the saffron party’s ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay, whose 100th birth anniversary fell on Sunday, and his concepts of ‘antyodaya’ (uplift of the last man) and integral humanism.
Touching upon the Kashmir unrest and Uri terror attack, the BJP chief asserted, “Kashmir is an unbreakable part of India and no force in the world can separate it from us.” The BJP-led government “is willing to discuss all paths to peace but the talks will be held with those who consider themselves Indians… No talks will be held with anybody who does not believe in the Constitution,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This is a clear message to separatists who are insisting that talks cannot be held within the Indian Constitution. Referring to the Uri attack, Shah said BJP will not tolerate terrorism and the party and its government stand for “zero tolerance” to it. Heaping praise on Modi, he compared him with noted freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak, saying he had infused hope and aspiration among masses with his “Gujarat model” during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and later with his work in the same way Tilak gave voice to the nation’s discontent with the colonial rule with his call for swaraj (self-rule).
BJP governments in 13 states besides the Centre are now working to unlift and empower the poor following the Upadhyay’s concept and that is why its dispensations in many states have been re-elected on the basis of performance, he said."

In a bid to draw attention to the handloom sector, particularly the “dying” jute industry in Bengal, one of the oldest pandals in the city has decided to worship a durga idol made of jute this year. Arambagh Puja Samiti here has designed the pandal on the the theme, “In Search of Roots” for which they have procured a “small” jute idol of the Indian Goddess from Purulia in West Bengal.

“I think this is first of it’s kind puja where the idol has been made from jute. We are trying to create awareness about the dying jute industry. We have called for a small Durga idol from West Bengal, which will be preserved in a museum after the puja,” says Abhijit Bose, Executive Chairman of Arambagh Puja Samiti.
The move, he says, is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative to promote the handloom sector in the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The idol has been designed by Gouranga Kuila, a Bengal-based artist who received the National Award for handicrafts in 2002.
The Samiti which has previously created pandals on issues like ‘World Peace’ and ‘Women Empowerment’ feels that their theme this year would encourage people to use products made of jute which in turn will help in boosting the industry’s growth.
“The condition of jute industry in India is very critical today. Over 40 lakh farmers and nearly 4 lakh mill workers depend on it for their livelihoods. Once people start using jute products, the industry will become competitive and sustainable again,” says Bose.
The pandal has been richly decorated with traditional artworks including Madhubani paintings adorning the walls. Innovative murals in betel nut skins render an element of Bengali authenticity to the celebrations.
On all four sides of the pandal are images that narrate the episode of Ram’s Akal Bodhan to Goddess Durga from the Hindu epic “Ramayana”.
The 45-feet gate of the pandal is in the form of a tribal woman holding a ‘diya’ in her hands, symbolic of the way of life in Purulia.
The puja celebrations will also recreate mini-Kolkata with food and festivity galore.
Popular performing traditions from Bengal such as Baul, Chou, Gambhira, Yatra, and Kavigaan will be part of the cultural programme, besides specialised artisans in ‘Dokra’ and ‘Poktkatha’ performing live on the occasion.
“It is an attempt to search for the roots of dying traditional artforms from Bengal. We have a rich cultural history which must be promoted and passed to younger generations. Through this year’s theme we want people to look back at our simple and harmonious traditions,” says Bose.
Recent Uri attacks will also find a special space in the celebrations, where the members of the committee will be paying homage to the jawans who lost their lives in the attack.
“Uri attack has been a big incident and we cannot ignore it. Durga Puja is in itself a symbol of the victory of good over evil. It is about destroying the devil and the same goes for terrorism too,” says Bose."

The Indian Army carried out surgical strikes along the Line of Control in Pakistan where terrorists had positioned themselves causing “significant” casualties. The attack by India was in response to the recent Uri attacks that killed 19 Indian soldiers. The move is being lauded by Indians across the world and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also getting a lot of praise for delivering on his promise that the attack on India will not go unpunished.
“The operations were focused on ensuring that these terrorists do not succeed in their design to cause destruction and endanger the lives of our citizens,” Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) said. India does not plan to carry out any other operation.

Back then, Modi had said “Pakistan should be given an answer in the language they understand,” and that we must create “international pressure”.
Well, many on social media said that he has indeed done what he said. The video has been retweeted nearly 3000 times.

National team captain P R Sreejesh today dedicated the Asian Championship Trophy triumph to the Indian soldiers martyred in the Uri attack and their families, saying it’s a Diwali gift to those who lost their lives while safeguarding the country.
“Winning Asian Championship Trophy is a Diwali gift to the Indian soldiers. The Indian soldiers, who are safeguarding our borders, would have definitely enjoyed this medal more than any other medal,” Sreejesh told reporters here after arriving from Kuala Lampur.
Sreejesh, along with Nikkin Thimmaiah, arrived at the city airport around 11.45 last night after defeating Pakistan in Asian Championship Trophy final.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It is also a Diwali gift to those kins of martyred soldiers who lost their lives in Uri attacks carried out by cross-border terrorists,” the Indian goalkeeper said.
The army base, located barely a few kilometers from the Line of Control (LoC) and about 70 km from Srinagar, was subjected to the brazen attack by four terrorists on September 18 at around 5.30 am, causing heavy casualties in the Dogra regiment.
Asked about the emotions running through the players while playing the final against Pakistan, Sreejesh said, “Yes, a lot of emotions run through the Indian players when they play against Pakistan. However, the players nowadays tend to focus more on the on-field battle than off-field issues,” he said.
The players did not let emotions get to them and shut themselves off the outside world, Sreejesh said.
“The players did not let their emotions take them over. The tournament was more about winning the title and performances,” he said.
The players also stayed away from social media to avoid controversies, especially when India was playing Pakistan, Sreejesh said.
“I think that was the best factor, apart from these players. It is a team with several youngsters, but they showed maturity on the field. We dominated this tournament,” he said.
“It was a different feeling this time,” he said.
“Of seven matches, we won six and drew one. That shows how good we are at the Asia level. That’s how we prepared for the league match against Pakistan,” he added."

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi again over the latter’s handling of Pakistan after the Uri attacks. He said Modi should now fulfill the promises that he had made about combating terrorism, before becoming the Prime Minister of the country. Thackeray also said war should be waged keeping national importance in mind and not for the sake of votes.
“Now the time has come to fulfill promises which they made to the people of India during Lok Sabha elections. When are we going to give answer to Pakistan in their own language? When such attack happens, we condemn it for a few days and then forget about them,” Thackeray said during an interaction with journalists Wednesday.
He said it was time Pakistan was given a reply in the language it understood because talks with the neighbouring nation would be futile. “Talking with Pakistan won’t work now. It is now time to answer Pakistan in the language it understands. If war (with Pakistan) is to take place, it should be for well-being of the nation, not for votes. When will we finally understand Pakistan’s language,” Thackeray said.

He also claimed that many people felt there was no perceptible change in this government’s behaviour with Pakistan compared to the previous UPA regime. “If you keep doing what the previous government did, how can you say there is an atmosphere of change in the country? It seems the government is of the view that those who want to shed tears may do so, we will continue to go to Pakistan to have tea and continue to welcome their artists and sportspersons here,” said Thackeray.
The Sena chief also called for a special one-day session of Maharashtra legislature to address the grievances of the Maratha community. “Maratha leaders should come forward and voice their issues. There needs to be a discussion on the atrocities Act and their reservation issue. We expect NCP president Sharad Pawar to raise this issue in Parliament while we will raise it in the state legislature,” he said."

Lucknow’s Aishbagh is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will be attending the Vijay Dashmi celebrations in the city’s iconic venue on Tuesday. Posters and banners have been put up near the venue days ahead of PM’s visit by his supporters and party volunteers.
‘Lucknow welcomes avengers of Uri’ reads one of the banners installed right outside the Aishbagh Ramleela Maidan with PM Modi and Rajnath Singh’s photo on it.
Apart from that, the banner also has popular dialogue from the movie ‘Ye Jawani hai Deewani’ saying “Yuva udna chahta hai, daudna chahta hai, girna bhi chahta hai par rukna nahi chahta” (the youth wants to fly, run and even fall but does not want to stop).

The banner invoking Uri attacks and Indian army’s response to it by carrying out surgical strikes along LoC has also drawn criticism from the people on social media. Several twitter users were seen posting the pictures of the banner.
Opposition parties have accused BJP of using the army’s action against terrorist for political gains ahead of Uttar Pradesh elections.
Earlier on Monday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also took a dig at PM Modi and said that he would have visited Bihar on Vijay Dashmi if the elections were scheduled to be held there. Uttar Pradesh will go into polls in 2017."

Vice President Hamid Ansari on Sunday strongly condemned the terrorist attack on an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri that killed 17 soldiers, saying it was the result of “cross-border terrorism by one particular country in our region.”
“My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those whose loved ones have been killed,” Ansari said.
“Such attacks are the result of the use of cross-border terrorism by one particular country in our region. We shall deal with such provocations in a befitting manner,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday attacked Samajwadi Party and BSP, saying ‘achche din’ will come in Uttar Pradesh only after the two parties are wiped out in the upcoming Assembly elections. “There have been wrongdoings in the liquor business at the level of the state government which will be exposed in time to come…achche din have come in the families of those who are asking where are the achche din,” he alleged. He was speaking at a public meeting seeking support for BJP candidate from Bisauli seat Kushagra Sagar.

The Home Minister was referring to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP president Mayawati who frequently question when ‘achche din’, promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in campaigning for 2014 elections, will come. Making an appeal to the electorate, he said, “Achche din will come in Uttar Pradesh only after SP and BSP are uprooted in the upcoming polls.”
Attacking Pakistan, Singh termed the Uri attack as a cowardly act for which a befitting reply was given by India. “I had gone to Pakistan where slogans were raised but I exposed them on their land,” he said. Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi over his remarks that there will be earthquake once he speaks, Rajnath said said there had not even been a wind and asked the Congress Vice President to speak if he has any ‘masala’ as per his claims.
The Union Minister said UP has been giving direction and creating history. It had created history in 2014 by ensuring full majority non-Congress government at the Centre, he added. Claiming that there had been not a single corruption charge against any BJP leader in almost three years at the Centre, Singh said, “SP, BSP and Congress point fingers at Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has held the head of the country high at the global level.”"

In an indication of the manner in which the crisis is being handled in the Valley, it was Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti who went to Raj Bhawan Sunday evening and along with Governor N N Vohra held a 90-minute “highest level” security review following the attack on the Army camp in the early hours of the morning.
In the past, the CM including Mehbooba Mufti — who called the latest attack an attempt to create a warlike situation in the region — have been chairing meetings of the Unified Command in Srinagar but these have never been attended by the governor.

It is the first time that the chief minister and the governor have co-chaired such a meeting where, officials who attended it said, strengthening of the counter-terrorism and counter-infiltration grid as well as putting a restraint on the protesting youth, especially in South Kashmir, were the two main points of discussion.
Besides the state police heads including DGP K Rajendra Kumar and the top brass of the BSF and CRPF, chief secretary Brij Raj Sharma and financial commissioner Bharat Vyas were present at the meeting.

Said a senior intelligence official who was present at Raj Bhawan on a day when both Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Army chief Dalbir Singh rushed to Uri: “For days we have been anticipating a terror strike specially since the number of protesters on the streets have come down sharply. We knew something would happen. One feeling is that Pakistan may have shot itself in the foot with the Uri strike coming almost one week before the UNGA (United Nations General Assembly) begins in New York.”

Condemning the attack, Mehbooba said, “The heightened tension in the wake of the Uri attack is set to further vitiate the atmosphere in and around Jammu and Kashmir amid increasing Indo-Pak hostility. The attack seems to be aimed at triggering fresh violence and creating a war-like situation in the region,” said Mehbooba, who expressed condolences to the families of the soldiers killed and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.
“The perpetrators of violence must understand that violent methods have yielded nothing in the past nor will these yield anything in future except adding to the miseries of the people,” Mehbooba said. “Unfortunately, people in Jammu and Kashmir, who are already mired in an agonising situation, shall have to bear the maximum brunt of the fresh attempts being made to step up violence and trigger fresh bloodshed in the state. J&K has always been the worst victim of Indo-Pak hostility and its people have been paying a colossal price for the same for the past over six decades”.
Vohra sought “enhanced surveillance” of key civil and military establishments. Governor Vohra, the Raj Bhawan spokesman said, called for a “multi-agency security audit” of all security forces and concerned agencies to “to identify and fill every existing gap for ensuring an effective and prompt counter-terror response”.
“The governor and the chief minister stressed the need for cohesive action for enforcing a constant vigil on the frontiers, stepping up counter-terrorism operations and effectively maintaining internal security,” the spokesman said. The chief minister and the governor urged the security agencies to work in tandem to “restore public order” in the Valley.

The savage ambush on the Line of Control which led to the decapitation of two Indian soldiers on Monday is believed to have been authorised by Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa following a visit to Pakistani military positions in Haji Pir on April 30, Indian intelligence and military sources have told The Indian Express. Local commanders, sources said, had underlined the need for reprisal strikes following the killing of seven to ten soldiers in an April 17 Indian artillery assault.
Lt General Nadeem Raza, who commands the Pakistan X Corps, responsible for Kashmir, pushed back against concerns that the retaliatory action could lead to escalation on the LoC, sources said, along with Major General Azhar Abbas, head of the Murree-based 12 Infantry Division, the formation whose units have been at the receiving end of the artillery duels on the LoC since last year. “Ever since the cross-Line of Control strikes that followed the Uri terrorist attack, things haven’t really quietened down” an Indian intelligence official said. “The skirmishing has been costly for Pakistan, and we think it’s trying to show India it is now willing to risk escalation, despite the weakness of its military position on the Line of Control.”
Estimated to deploy some 200,000-225,000 troops along the LoC, the Indian Army’s 15 and 16 Corps in Jammu and Kashmir have overwhelming numerical superiority against Pakistan. Pakistan’s X Corps, made up of the 23 Infantry Division, 12 Infantry Division, 19 Infantry Division and Force Command Gilgit-Baltistan, has some 100,000-125,000 troops. General Bajwa, who came to office soon after the cross-border raids ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the wake of the Uri attack, has placed Kashmir high on his agenda, visiting the Kel sector in March, and the shelling-hit Bhimber sector in December and February.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Haji Pir, the site of his April 30 visit, is a strategically-vital pass India captured in the 1965 war and then returned to Pakistan in a territory-swap, and marks the northern end of India’s Krishna Ghati sector in Mendhar, where the ambush took place Monday. Élite special forces, sources said, are believed to have monitored the Indian patrol that left Kirpan post, manned by the 200 Battalion of the Border Security Force, early in the morning, in a routine search for improvised explosive devices, knowing it would take cover in the nearest available space when machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are fired from across the Line of Control. “The killing was over inside just a few minutes,” a BSF officer, who spoke to the two survivors, said.
The lethal ambush came days after the largest Indian fire assault since last year, targeting Pakistani posts across a large swathe of the LoC in Poonch and Rajouri. The Pakistan Army had made no official statement on the April 17 fire assault by India. However, Indian military observers estimate that up to ten Pakistani soldiers may have been killed or injured in fire directed at a position identified on Indian maps by the codename Pimple, facing Kirpan post.
Four civilians — Mohammad Shakil, Ishrat Bibi, Irum Younas and Atif Majeed — were, however, reported to have been injured in Kotli and Bhimber districts because of Indian shelling across the LoC that day. Indian military sources said the unusually heavy fire assault on Pakistani positions was ordered to retaliate after sustained fire was directed on both civilian and military positions that morning, forcing the closure of schools near the LoC in Rajouri.
Earlier skirmishing in the Rajouri-Poonch belt had led to the April 1 killing of Naib Subedar S Sanayaima Som by an improvised explosive device believed to have been laid by a Pakistan Army raiding party, while sepoy Deepak Ghadge was killed in shelling on March 9. Last November, Indian troops ambushed and killed seven Pakistani soldiers near the LoC in Sundarbani, following the decapitation of the 17 Sikh Regiment’s Sepoy Mandeep Singh. Singh’s mutilated corpse was discovered after he got separated from his patrol near the LoC ahead of Kala Post, one of several Indian forward positions in the volatile Machil sector. The killing was the first major showdown on the LoC after the post-Uri strikes.
Following the ambush in Sundarbani, Pakistan hit back, killing three Indian soldiers engaged in a counter-infiltration patrol along the Lashdat nullah in Machil, one of whose bodies was mutilated by the attackers. The onset of winter had ended skirmishing on the northern stretches of the LoC, but mortar and machine-gun fire continued to be exchanged through the spring in Rajouri and Poonch, culminating with the violence in April and May. Indian and Pakistani troops have both been accused of beheading enemy soldiers. In one gruesome August 2011 incident, Pakistan complained that three soldiers, including an officer, were beheaded in an Indian raid on a post in the Sharda sector, across the Neelum river valley in Kel. The raid is believed to have been carried out to retaliate against the decapitation of two Indian soldiers near Karnah by Pakistani special forces."

Self-proclaimed film critic Kamaal R Khan has been doing movie reviews for quite sometime now and his only qualification to do so is his film Deshdrohi, which he directed and also acted in. It’s difficult to comprehend how that makes him a movie critic but then India is a democracy and we do have freedom of speech!
But now he has come up with a video, which he calls is a ‘review’ of the surgical strikes that India conducted on seven terrorist launch pads along the Line of Control on September 30, which caused “significant casualties”. In his ‘review’, he suggests the action taken by the Indian Army in retaliation to Uri attacks that killed at least 18 soldiers was, in fact, a political strike being used by the government for its electoral gain. “After statement of defence minister, it’s clear that it’s a political strike not surgical,” he tweeted.
He constantly questions why the government is not using the opportunity of Pakistan denying the strike, in its favour. “I have seen this for the first time in my life. India is asking the neighbour to come and attack us in response to the surgical strike,” he says. Well, we haven’t heard any person in the government or Army making such a statement or even implying any such thought, but then KRK’s got his inferences.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In another absurd statement, he asks why India should stop the surgical strikes against terrorists if it kills them without any collateral damage? “Once the surgical strikes have begun, in my opinion, we should continue it. Whenever terrorists enter India, we should conduct surgical strikes and kill them but India has decided to stop and I don’t understand why,” he says.
Facepalm?
It doesn’t stop there. “As we have started taking revenge, we should do so every three-four days,” he adds.
He concludes by throwing a question asking if it was a surgical strike or an ‘election’ strike. “The next surgical strike will happen when the next elections take place,” he says.

Days before Karan Johar’s film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil lands in theatres, it has received a body blow. The Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI), after a meeting on October 14, has decided not to screen any film starring Pakistani artistes. This applies to single-screen theatres in four states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa.

Addressing the media, COEAI’s president Nitin Datar said that the decision was not taken under any political pressure, but rather, keeping public sentiment in mind. “Today, the meeting of Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India took place and it was decided that keeping in mind the patriotic feelings and the national interest of our country, we request all our members and exhibitors to refrain from screening movies which have involvement of any Pakistani artist, technicians, directors, music directors etc,” Datar said. “We are also in the process of requesting other associations connected with the film industry to support the sentiments in the best interest of our nation.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that while the decision to not screen certain films would cause monetary losses for the theatre owners, there might have been greater damage if their screens were vandalised. “The association is not going to screen any movie and the decision implies from today until things don’t get normal. States included under the association are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa,” Datar added.
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil stars Pakistani star Fawad Khan in a pivotal role and will be the first such film to hit the theatres after the escalated tension between the two countries in the aftermath of Uri attack.
Earlier, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had threatened to block the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in Maharashtra. Later, the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) announced a ban on Pakistani actors but had requested MNS for a smooth release of films that have already been finished. Other than Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, films which will be hit by this ban include Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees starring Mahira Khan as well as Dear Zindagi which has Ali Zafar.
There was speculation that Karan Johar may replace Fawad in his film starring Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma but a source in Dharma, his production house, confirmed to indianexpress.com on Thursday that the actor would not be dropped. The film has been passed by censor board already. It will release on October 28."

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s absence from Monday’s review meeting on the Uri attack, chaired by the PM, was noticed by everyone. She was the only minister in the top four not to attend the meeting, and it was read by many as an attempt to keep diplomatic concerns out of the decision-making on government’s response to Uri. However, Swaraj is likely to address the UN General Assembly in New York next week, and is expected to raise this issue there. Incidentally, the last time Swaraj had skipped an important ministerial gathering — July’s Cabinet reshuffle — she had tweeted in advance about her other engagements and asked the media not to make her absence into a headline. There was no such forewarning this time.

On The Fence
BJP has been thinking of ways to shed an “anti-Dalit image” ever since the suicide of research scholar Rohith Vemula at Hyderabad University earlier this year. But it still seems undecided on whether Vemula was Dalit or not. On Monday, over 100 Dalit leaders of the party met for a brainstorming session to discuss ways to renew its outreach. The participants were each given a list of suicides that had happened in Hyderabad University since 2006. Against each victim’s name was his or her caste — SC, OBC or General. Vemula was last on the list, but his caste was struck out, making it unreadable.
Unusual Move
If it was unusual for a senior IAS officer to begin an opinion poll on ways to deal with Pakistan, it was even more amusing when he cut it short claiming “rigging” by “Pakis”. Sanjay Dixit, Rajasthan Cricket Association’s secretary general, crowd-sourced options on Twitter about how India should punish Pakistan following the Uri attacks. He put forth four options, ranging from maximum strength attack to an offer of peace. Within four hours, Dixit declared that the mood was “overwhelmingly for action”, with 34 per cent votes for a “strike with full might”. He then suddenly suspended the poll as nearly a fourth of the respondents had opted for the offer of peace — a result that, he claimed, was because of “rigging”."

Actress Kalki Koechlin, who has been busy shooting for her films, has kept mum all this while about the sidelining of Pakistani actors in Bollywood and says she doesn’t want to add fuel to the fire. “I don’t want to add fuel to the fire because this thing has been going on for a long time. I personally think that we live in an international world and we have Indians living all over the world. If we asked all those NRIs to come back to India, then we would have nowhere to put them,” Kalki said.

“So, similarly, if there are guests from other countries living in our country, myself included, who is of French origin but born and bought up in India, where do I belong? If I don’t belong in this country, then I don’t know where I belong to. So, I think it’s very important to understand that,” she added.
Post the Uri attack, tensions between India and Pakistan have taken an ugly turn, following which a debate has raged on whether Pakistani actors should be banned from working in India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, the actress, who is also associated with online home decor magazine Beautifulhomes.com, says she loves Sussanne Khan’s house.
Asked by all celebrity friends whose house she found beautiful and why she said: “… I think Sussanne Khan’s taste is amazing; she has a natural eye for things and she has an airy-fairy quality also. She has these little details like garden norms, fairies which I really find quirky and nice.”
Beautifulhomes.com, the quintessential e-decor magazine, was launched on Wednesday evening in the presence of actor Kalki Kochelin.
Talking about her association with beautifulhomes.com, she said: “This is my first association with beautiful homes and I just bought a beautiful home for myself this year.
“For the first time I have a house of my own and its a very exciting thing of course and I think what is great about beautiful homes is that they make is very personal, they really work towards getting your home as per your personality and it’s affordable, for the common person, it’s a one point stop where you can do everything.
“Its really hard to get a home together, so many different aspects go into it. There is the contractor, there an electrician, there is a painter, there is this and there is that, and this is one stop where you can find all of it.”"

Hussain said “every action has a reaction, and Pakistan felt the need to develop close ties with Russia after President Barack Obama’s two visits to India.
“This was the start of a new chapter in Pakistan-Russia ties,” Hussain was quoted as saying by Dawn News.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The senator added that Russia is in favour of building a working relationship with countries of the region and it has also started a dialogue process with Afghan Taliban through back-door channels. He said the US State Department had refused to give visa to then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in 2006, but when Modi was elected as Prime Minister, the US changed its policy for “political gains”.
“This U-turn of US policy can be traced back to the time of Bush administration, when the US-India nuclear deal was signed which was against the law of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,” said Hussain.
“Stability of Afghanistan and eradication of terrorism is a top priority of the US, which needs Pakistan to play a role in the peace-process. Pakistan is not only providing its assistance in the peace process but also facing damages,” the senator said.
He also said that violating Indus Waters Treaty will be an “act of war”.
“Apart from Pakistan and India, the World Bank is also a stakeholder in the treaty,” said Hussain.
Commenting on the Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir, Husain said, “UN military observer group for India and Pakistan should investigate the Uri attack. Crossing the Line of Control to attack any target in India is not possible for any militant.”
He added that if India has any evidence or intelligence regarding the attack, it should be shared with Pakistan.
A contingent of Russian ground forces arrived in Pakistan earlier in September for the first ever joint Pak-Russian military exercise.
The two-week-long exercise is expected to continue until October 10. Around 200 military personnel of both countries will participate in the drills.
The exercises with Russian ground forces came amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan."

India’s failure to resolve the Kashmir issue and improve relationship with Pakistan has been an ‘impediment’ to India’s rise and become the greatest hurdle in it becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the NSG, Pakistan Prime Minister’s envoys claimed on Wednesday.
“What is the incentive (for peace talks). The biggest incentive in failure to resolve Kashmir and improve relationship with Pakistan is (the) single biggest obstacle to peace security and stability in South Asia. It is an impediment to India’s rise,” Special Kashmir Envoy of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Mushahid Hussain Syed, said.

Syed along with Shazra Mansab, who is another Kashmir Envoy, are currently visiting the US as part of the Pakistani effort to apprise the international community of the current situation in Kashmir and allegations of human rights violations in the Valley.
Responding to a question in their joint appearance at the Atlantic Council – a top American think-tank – Syed warned that New Delhi’s inability to resolve the Kashmir issue and improve ties with its neighbour Pakistan would prevent India from becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
“It is an impediment to India’s economic development. If Kashmir had been solved, Shashi Tharoor would have been Secretary General of the United Nations. If Kashmir had been resolved India would have been in Nuclear Suppliers Group.

“If Kashmir would have been resolved, India would have been permanent member of the UN Security Council. But as long as you have disputes with your neighbour, you have a lingering dispute under the United Nations resolutions, which you have promised to implement and you are not implementing them for expediency reasons, you can’t be at the high table in the world of global politics,” Syed said.
To another question, Syed warned that any violation of the Indus Water Treaty would be considered as an “act of war” and a “violation” of the international treaty.
Stating that India too might face similar problems on its Brahmaputra river, which originates from China, the Pakistani official threatened this would “boomerang” on India.
“It’s not (just an issue) between India and Pakistan. It (involves) World Bank. If you start doing that, we are a lower riparian, but do not forget one thing, India is some lower riparian vis-a-vis China. And the Brahmaputra river has origins there. It is going to boom rang on you. That would be disastrous,” he said.
Earlier in their remarks, both Syed and Mansab reiterated the allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir and described slain terrorist Burhan Wani as a “freedom fighter”.

Syed said there have been, however, positive developments in Indo-Pak ties recently, with the national security advisors from the two countries establishing a contact.
However, the envoys had to face tough questions on human rights violations inside Pakistan from people belonging to Balochistan, Sindh and Pak- occupied Kashmir, who accused the Pakistani establishment of grave violation of human rights, extra-judicial killings, and arrests and tortures by Pak Army and ISI besides raising questions on ‘duplicity’ of Pakistan with regard to fight against terrorism."

Government has formed an inter-ministerial task force, to be headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra, to look into all the strategic aspects of Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan. A formal notification to this effect was issued on Friday, a top government functionary said on Saturday, adding other members of the team include NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and Secretaries in ministries of Finance, Environment, Power and Water Resource.

Besides, Chief Secretaries of Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, the states from where the six Indus system rivers flow, will be “invitees” in the task force. “The task force is mandated with taking all important strategic and policy decisions. It is an all-powerful body which will take decisions regarding the treaty,” he added. The committee has been formed nearly three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on the 56-year-old water distribution pact with Pakistan in the aftermath of series of cross-border terror strikes including Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In that meeting, it was also decided that India would exploit to the maximum water of Pakistan-controlled rivers including Jhelum. Meanwhile, a source said the World Bank, which has paused two separate mechanisms, will send an expert to discuss with both India and Pakistan their versions on designs of Kishenganga and Ratle projects being constructed by India in Jammu and Kashmir.
Pakistan had in September approached World Bank, flagging concerns that the design of the Kishenganga project was not in line with the criteria laid down under IWT. It had then demanded the international lender to set up a Court of Arbitration to look into the matter. Refuting the claims made by Pakistan, India had asserted that the project design is “well within parameters” of the treaty and urged the World Bank to appoint a neutral expert as the issue is a “technical matter” as suggested in the treaty.
Under the Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 and to which the World Bank is also a party, the global body has a specified role in the process of resolution of differences and disputes."

India will carefully decide its future course of action in the aftermath of the terror attack in Uri and will not do anything on the basis of what Pakistan says, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said today.
“We must not pay heed to Pakistan’s reaction. Everything is in front of the people. We will take our next steps carefully. It does not matter what Pakistan says,” he told reporters here.

India had reacted strongly to the deadliest attack on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir in a quarter-century-old insurgency that sparked an outrage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly condemning it.
Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh chaired a high-level review meeting in Delhi in wake of the terror attack.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, MoS PMO Jitendra Singh, Intelligence Bureau chief Dineshwar Sharma, Army Chief Dalbir Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval , DGMO Lt. General Ranbir Singh and other officials were present in the meeting.
Rajnath had in a strongly worded statement Sunday said Pakistan is a “terrorist state” and should be isolated.
Parrikar is likely to meet and brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday on the Uri attack.
Parrikar and Army Chief General Dalbir Singh visited Srinagar Sunday to take stock of the situation and review the overall security in Kashmir.

Later, they also met the casualties at the Army Base Hospital in BB Cantonment."

Arul Horizon
Shrikant Mhalgi, who had been running an electronics shop in Narayan Peth for the past four decades, said the increasing demand for chinese lights, which had almost killed the market for indigenous lights over the last five to six years, has seen a significant dip this year.

Owner of Mhalgi Enterprises, he said, this is the first Diwali when most of the customers are particularly asking for Indian Diwali lightings. “Earlier, only five to 10 per cent customers would ask for Indian lights. But this year, around 70 per cent have exclusively asked for Indian lights. Obviously, it is the impact of the Uri attack in which Pakistan had killed our soldiers. Now no one wants Chinese lights,” added Mhalgi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The growing aversion to Chinese products in Pune, and across India, gained momentum following China’s support for Pakistan in the backdrop of Uri attack. Sharing this thought, newly-married Kirti Khandelwal, who will be celebrating her first Diwali this year with husband Gaurav in Kharadi, said, “There’s no way we or for that matter any sensible Indian would opt for Chinese lights now. As far as we are concerned, it’s not just this year but in the coming years too we will be buying only Made in India lights.”
So what is it that made Chinese lights find their way into the Indian market in the first place? Vikram Hingmire, the owner of Gauri Electricals in Kothrud, explains, “While the price of Chinese lights starts from Rs 20, the Indian lights begin with Rs 250. Not everyone can afford them. The downside is that the Indian lights last for four to five years with proper care, Chinese lights are like ‘use and throw’. I won’t say that there are no customers for Chinese lights this year; there are still a few shoppers who want them. But, compared to previous years, their percentage is now hardly five to 10.”
The change in shopping trend this year has resulted in an increase in revenue booked by the shopkeepers. Kailash Borate, a shopkeeper from Ravivar Peth, admits, “Since Indian lights cost more and are selling more than the Chinese ones, the rise in the income is obviously increased slightly this year – around 15 per cent.”Pune NewsRunway resurfacing: Pune airport closure for two weeks deferredIn Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, industry seeks clarity on lockdown guidelinesPimpri Chinchwad police arrest ‘criminal on record’ for recording video in police stationClick here for more
While price of Chinese lights ranges between Rs 20 to Rs 400, the Indian ones cost between Rs 250 to Rs 350."

(Source: Express Photo)
Kicking off his poll campaign on Monday ahead of the first phase of the Gujarat Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Congress was “making fun of the poor as a tea seller grabbed their gaddi (seat)”, and accused it of “conspiring” and “throwing out four Patidar chief ministers” of the state.
He identified himself as “son of Gujarat”, and said recently “so much kichad (muck)” has been thrown at the BJP that it made “the lotus bloom easy”. To corner the Congress over the issue of terrorism, Modi compared the response of the UPA government following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 with that of the NDA government after the Uri attack in 2016 and mentioned the surgical strike by the Army along the LoC.
He referred to a report in The Indian Express on the surgical strikes to make the point that bodies of those killed in the strikes had been carted away.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Prime Minister held public meetings at Bhuj (Kutch), Jasdan (Rajkot), Chalala (Amreli) and Kadodara (Surat), targeting nearly 30 Assembly constituencies which will go to polls on December 9. The Surat event was earlier planned in the Patidar-dominated area of Kamrej, but later moved 18-km away to Kadodara.
At these meetings, Modi accused the Congress of insulting him, besides being unfair towards the Patidars and largely people of Gujarat. He slammed the opposition party over the issues of demonetisation, GST and terrorism and also reminded people of his achievements both as Gujarat chief minister and now as Prime Minister, especially bringing water to parched areas of the state though Narmada project.
In a bid to strike a chord with the audience at his first public meeting in Bhuj: “I have come here as your son. You (people) have brought me up like a son. And how dare you (Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi) come to Gujarat and abuse her son?”

He reiterated his charge that the Congress and the Gandhi-Nehru family always hated Gujarat and its people since the time of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.  The PM then posed a question to those attending the rally, “Will any Gujarati forgive that? Will you forgive the attack on your son? Will you forgive the atrocity on your son?.” The audience shouted “no” in reply.
“Gujarat had tolerated injustice you had done to it during the time of Sardar Patel. But, now times have changed. Gujarat will not tolerate insults. You must understand it,” Modi said. He further said: “For the past few days, people from across the country have hurled so much muck that it has made blossoming of lotus very easy.”
The Prime Minister’s statement came days after Youth Congress posted “tu chai bech” meme on Twitter targeting him. To corner the Congress over the issue of terrorism, Modi compared the response of the UPA government following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 with that of the NDA government after the Uri attack in 2016 as he referred to the surgical strike by the Army along the LoC.
“Our soldiers killed them in their homes. If you cannot maintain dignity of the Indian army, you should have at least stayed silent… You asked questions like why even a single soldier was not injured or killed (in surgical strike), is there a video or photograph of it…,” said Modi, adding, “Did we go to shoot a film there?”
“Should we shoot it like you do while having food at a poor family’s home?” he asked amid screams of ‘Modi, Modi’ in the audience. He also mentioned how The Indian Express had reported on the surgical strikes.
In a apparent reference to Rahul’s recent “hugplomacy fail” tweet after alleged 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed was released from house arrest following an order by a Pakistani court, the PM said: “Recently, a Pakistani court released a terrorist. I cannot understand, if why are Congress people clapping… In Doklam, the Indian Army was standing eye to eye on border (with the Chinese army) for 70 days and you were embracing the Chinese ambassador. When Indian soldier was standing against the Chinese soldiers in chilling temperatures, you were giving hugs to the Chinese ambassador.”
Gandhi had recently tweeted: “Narendrabhai, baat nahi bani. Terror mastermind is free. President Trump just delinked Pak military funding from LeT. Hugplomacy fail. More hugs urgently needed.” Modi said “vikas” was his mantra for Gujarat and cited several instances of Kutch’s progress under his leadership as the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to early 2014 in various sectors like tourism, agriculture and infrastructure. Modi said that BJP has transformed Kutch into a land of development from what it once used to be known as the land of “smugglers”.
Citing the success story of Kesar mango of Kutch, and without naming Rahul, Modi said: “Certain people can’t understand certain things. If you tell them about Kesar mango, they will say that one gets Kesar (saffron) in Jammu & Kashmir. Now, tell me should I waste time in arguing with such people?” The audience replied in negative, screaming ‘Pappu.’
“I want to tell those who are spreading only pessimism, ‘Please, don’t weigh the country with your weaknesses. You do not have ‘niyat’, ‘niti’, ‘neta’ or ‘nata with soil,” said Modi.
Aiming at the Patidar votes in Jasdan, he accused the Congress of “conspiring” to throw out the then CM Keshubhai Patel on the pretext of the 2001 earthquake. He said, “Keshubhai Patel, a Patel son and Kathiawad no dikro (son of Kathiawad) , became the first BJP chief minister of Gujarat, but in the name of the earthquake, they spread all kinds of fear in the country and abroad… All these conspiracies to throw out the Keshubhai government happened in the Congress karyalaya.” Modi had become chief minister in October 21 after Kehubhai was removed.
He accused the Congress of throwing out “four Patidar chief ministers of Gujarat”. “For the first time, there was a Janta Morcha government in Gujarat, Babubhai Jashbhai Patel became chief minister of Gujarat with the support of Jan Sangh…this Congress could not stand it… in the name of emergency it conspired to put MLAs in jail and did horse trading. In nine months, the Congress sent him home and all his ministers to jail and handed over the government to Madhavsinhbhai.
Then it was the turn of Chimanbhai Patel… Indiraben (Gandhi) thought…’this Chimanbhai? he wants to go on his own in Gujarat?’. She kicked up such a storm in Gujarat that he too was thrown out. Again the BJP supported Chimanbhai, under the leadership of Keshubhai, and made him chief minister,” said Modi.
Blaming the Congress for Anandiben Patel’s resignation, he said: “Again they brought their men into the field…they put all their money and fanned the riot (the Patidar quota violence) to disturb her… This Congress party did not let four Patidar chief ministers sit in peace in Gujarat.”
Attacking the Congress for “making fun of the poor”, Modi said,”Now they are worried… a tea seller grabbed their gadi (seat). Never seen such contempt… if the son of a poor becomes the country’s prime minister, you should not be unhappy… was this seat handed over to you in inheritance? Congress, write this down…this is Modi, he will sell tea but not the country (a reference to scams during the UPA government). “
Jasdan has been a Congress bastion. Kunwarji Bavaliya, who is the Congress candidate from here, has represented the seat four times — 1995, 1998, 2002 and 2007. In 2012, the Congress retained the seat with Bholabhai Gohel as its MLA, but he voted for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections and was sacked from the party. The BJP candidate is Bharat Boghra.
The Prime Minister, during his rallies, responded to the Congress’s allegation of demonetistation and rushed implementation of GST hurting the economy, even as he noted that the central government was bringing changes to GST structure as per requirements.
At Chalala near Dhari in Amreli district, Modi claimed that the Congress “lost all its earning sons” after demonetisation and that’s why the party has been raising the issue even after one year.

He alleged the previous UPA government made money by allowing high retail prices of LED bulbs. He said during the UPA rule an LED bulb used to cost Rs 350, but since the NDA took over the reins, price of a single bulb has came down to Rs 6o.
“Where was the money going? In whose pocket was it going? I know the Congress is worried because all of its gates are closed. Why does not the Congress stop wailing over demonetisation even after 12 months… It (Congress) has lost all its earning sons after demonetisation. This is the reason tears are not drying up from their eyes… But, should we allow plunder of this country? Shouldn’t we bring back what has been plundered? Shouldn’t we win back rights of the poor. I’m fighting for this and won’t stop, come what may. People of this country have elected me for this only. I’ve started a yagna of cleaning up corruption, black money and dishonesty from the country. Won’t they eat Modi raw should they catch hold of him? Aren’t they waiting for me?” the PM said.
Modi claimed that three crore LED bulbs have been distributed in Gujarat, helping people to have an accumulated savings of Rs 2,000 crore on electricity.
He also accused the Congress governments, which ruled the state till 1995, of delaying the Narmada dam project and thereby not improving lives of people of Saurashtra and Kutch regions. “Our Kutch-Kathiawad was becoming a deserted country. Youth were migrating to Surat and Mumbai, and would spend life in slums. Despite owning 25 bigha to 50 bigha land, why the youth had to migrate from Kutch-Kathiawad, leaving behind aged parents? If governments of the past had brought Narmada water 30 years ago, Gujarat and Kutch-Kathiawad would not have to wait this long,” said Modi.
In Kadodara area of Surat, the Prime Minister accused the Congress of dividing society on communal and caste lines. “Twenty five years ago, ?the Congress had done some bad deeds of dividing the society… They made a brother fight brother, and have used the casteism poison and Gujarat is still paying for their sins. You (Congress) are using your old tricks on these new-age youth. These are changed youths.” He also referred to a Congress minister going to jail in connection with a blast case.

Earlier the public meeting was slated to be held at Patidar-dominated Kamrej on the outskirts of the Surat city, but the venue was changed. Members of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti had protest at BJP’s election office in the constituency a few days ago.
Addressing the public meeting, PM said: “In the Uttar Pradesh elections, they have made atmosphere that the BJP will get only 25 seats and they have also discussed about the donkeys of Gujarat. They had likened Gujaratis with donkeys… They are now coming to touch the feet of donkeys. Such insult cannot be tolerated by any society. They don’t know that Gujarat people will take its revenge.”
Modi will now visit the state on November 29 and hold public meetings at Morbi, Prachi (Gir Somnath), Palitana (Bhavnagar) and Navsari."

Nonsense, rubbish and pathetic. No we are not talking about Swami Om’s new theatric in Bigg Boss. These are the words that can best describe the news show on a Pakistani TV channel which claimed that actor Om Puri’s death was a brutal murder plotted by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Yes, you read it right.
Modi and Doval killed Om Puri, according Pakistan’s Bol TV. And why did they kill Om Puri? Because Om Puri spoke in favour of Pakistani artistes when there were clamour against them in India after the Uri attack. Not just that. The actor, according to the news show, was recently summoned by Doval at his residence where he was brutally beaten up, stripped off his clothes, abused, and asked to go to Uri martyr Nitin Yadav’s village and apologise for his remark. Wow. They must think every country works like Pakistan.

The anchor of the show in full voice also made a ‘sensational revealation’ of the post mortem report of Om Puri, the report which is yet to be prepared by the doctors and accessed by the Indian media. The so called post mortem report has revealed that the actor was forced to drink and when he was out of his sense he was smothered to death by a pillow. It also claimed that the body of Om Puri had the marks of the killer who was an agent of Doval. And the murder took place on the direction of Modi because, of course, Om Puri was the biggest threat to national security. And we thought Indian news shows were bad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
And it doesn’t ends here. According to the news report on the channel, the next targets of Modi and Doval are Fawad Khan and Salman Khan. So the next surgical strikes by the Indian forces will be at Fawad’s residence. Bravo. And, beware Salman.
WATCH VIDEO | Om Puri His Cinematic Journey

Om Puri, one of the finest actors India has ever produced, died on January 6 after suffering a cardiac arrest. The news of his sudden demise came as a big shock for lovers of cinema. Not just in India, but cinema lovers in Pakistan too paid rich tributes to the actors. And why not, Om did a number of Pakistani films and his performances were well received there.
Om’s dead body had injury marks, most probably because he might have fallen. According to the preliminary report, he did not die of ‘natural causes’. A case of accidental death was even lodged at a Mumbai police station.
But nobody gave a murder angle to his death, except of course Pakistani media. According to Om Puri’s close friend Khalid Kidwai, the actor had consumed alcohol the night before his death. So he might have fallen and suffered a head injury. However, it will be too early to reach any conclusion. But where others can’t reach, Pakistani TV anchors can.

Responsibility is a word that every journalist must always keep in mind while reporting a news. And that is simply missing from Pakistani journalists’ dictionary. In the name of sensationalism, they go to any extent to malign India, its policy, its leaders and also its people despite being proven wrong time and again. Some recent TV reports across the border even claimed that Pakistan won all the wars against India. RIP, facts.
Whenever there is tension along the borders, there is effort to normalise situations with people to people contacts, cultural exchange, sports and art. And media plays a crucial role by sharing the views and opinions of people from all walks to make things better. But, it seems the TV channels on there have some other ideas. News of Puri’s death was published on many Urdu news websites, with most reports referring to his desire for better relations between the both the countries. Bol TV should have read those reports before telecasting such a ridiculous show."

PUNJAB CONGRESS president Captain Amarinder Singh Monday called for “an eye-for-an-eye” action against Pakistan for the Uri terror attack early Sunday that left 18 dead and 70 injured.
During an Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express office, Amarinder said the government should shun the “appeasement business” and get down to retaliation. He also sought an inquiry into the attack.
“We do not ask them to declare war but I believe in the old system of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. If Pakistan kills your 10 soldiers, you kill their 20. Something has to be done. Otherwise, you will demoralise your forces, the country will ask you questions. Enough is enough,” said Amarinder.

“This business of appeasement is not going to resolve anything. I think we are encouraging these sort of things by saying we are all for peace. This is not the job of the Army to do. Unless you break the backbone of terrorism in Kashmir, nobody would come to negotiate with you,” he said.
At the same time, Amarinder demanded an inquiry into so many killings. “There has to be a thorough inquiry into why this happened. For one battalion to have lost 17 and 70 wounded, out of which 34 critically wounded, 10 of them may not survive because they are badly burnt. They shot an anti-tank grenade into a petrol dump. Grenades are not very effective and everyone dying of grenade is not the case.
Here in this case [referring to Uri attack] these were highly motivated guys who had come across that very night and early morning they carried out the strike. Our two battalions, 6 Bihar and 10 Dogras, were changing hands. But that does not mean you let your guard down. We have changed hands so many times before. You maintain your alertness all the time. The duty was of 10 Dogra to hold till the time 6 Bihar had not shifted in. I think an inquiry needs to be done from that angle. This is the biggest number of our personnel ever from a battalion that we have lost in an attack ever since Independence.”
Defending the Army, Amarinder said: “I know this belt very well, it is a very highly fortified belt. We have got posts there which are really blistering with weapons, they have all these names like Santra, Malta. Then there is wire stretching across the border. Army cannot defend every inch of the ground. It is the aggressor who always has the advantage, and he cuts through the wires. It was a base of the battalion. The base must be defended.”
Stating it was his individual stand being a Punjabi, Amarinder said, “I do not know what stand my party is going to take. I am saying it purely as a Punjabi, as somebody interested in security of the state because we have common borders too. And we have been through this for 25 years. I do not want this to happen again. As a soldier I say this that they will have to be taken to task.”
Calling for the need to take the Army into confidence, Amarinder said, “Certainly, the Army Chief would have solutions. The Prime Minister must have discussed it at that level. We have special force battalions, we have gallantry soldiers. It should be that if they kill 10 of ours, we should kill 20 of theirs. It should come down to that. That is the only answer. Israel does it. It’s time we also started retaliating.”

On the issue of sharing of waters by Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL), Amarinder said if the Supreme Court’s decision would not be in favour of Punjab, the party MLAs will resign enmasse and seek mandate again on the issue.

“Since the Supreme Court bench was going to retire on November 30 and the final decision was expected by then, if the judgment goes against us, which is likely, we will all quit and force a fresh election. We will go back to the House and we will bring about another law to protect our interests. We will do it constitutionally. We will not do a morcha like Mr (CM Parkash Singh) Badal does all the time. We have protected Punjab for 12 years.” he said.
Justifying his stand, Amarinder said “the fact of the matter is there is something called Riparian Principle that only those states have the right to water from where the natural flow goes, the basins. They have not even looked at that and the arguments are not on that. That is what we insist on. Whether it is Canada or America or anywhere in the world, Riparian Principle is the way.

(Source: Wikimedia Commons)
Indian and Pakistani officials are currently in the midst of a two day meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission, starting Monday. The meeting is likely to address the conflict between the two countries over the construction of the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants on Kishenganga and Chenab rivers respectively. Signed in 1960, the IWT is an agreement that was signed by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the then President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, marking out control over the six rivers running across the Indus basin following partition of the subcontinent.
Internationally, the IWT is seen as one of the most successful cases of conflict resolution especially considering the fact that it has stayed in place despite the two countries having been engaged in four wars. However, between the two countries, it has seeded dissatisfaction and conflicts regarding its interpretation and implementation. As the two countries look forward to engaging in discussion over the current dispute, here’s a look at the historical background and nature of the treaty and the conflicts it has given rise to.

What is the Indus Water Treaty (IWT)?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The six rivers of the Indus basin originate in Tibet and flow across the Himalayan ranges to end in the Arabian sea south of Karachi. Preceding partition, it was one common network for both India and Pakistan. However, while partition managed to draw terrestrial borders, the question of how to divide the Indus waters was something that needed to be worked out. Since the rivers flowed from India to Pakistan, the latter was unsurprisingly threatened by the prospect of being fed by the former.
Initially, the issue of water sharing was sorted out by the Inter-Dominion accord of May 4, 1948 that laid out that India would release enough waters to Pakistan in return for annual payments from the latter. The problems of this arrangement was soon realised and it was considered necessary to find an alternative solution.
Eventually, in 1960, the two countries reached a decisive step with the intervention of the World Bank wherein precise details were laid out regarding the way in which the waters would be distributed. The components of the treaty were fairly simple. The three western rivers (Jhelum, Chenab and Indus) were allocated to Pakistan while India was given control over the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Sutlej). While India could use the western rivers for consumption purpose, restrictions were placed on building of storage systems. The treaty states that aside of certain specific cases, no storage and irrigation systems can be built by India on the western rivers.
Why are the two countries dissatisfied by the treaty?
From the Indian point of view, the basic dissatisfaction with the treaty arises from the fact that it prevents the country from building any storage systems on the western rivers. Even though the treaty lays out that under certain exceptional circumstances storage systems can be built, the complaint raised by India is that Pakistan deliberately stops any such effort due to the political rivalry it shares with India. The matter is further aggravated by the fact that the western rivers lie in the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir, which has been a subject of tussle between the two countries since independence. Since the treaty’s conception in 1960, the two countries have been embroiled in conflicts over a number of projects including the Salal hydroelectric project on the Chenab, the Tulbul project, the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants.
While the tense political relations between the two countries have to a large extent resulted in conflicts over the treaty, to a large extent it is the framing of the treaty itself that has led to grievances. Water policy expert, Ramaswamy R. Iyer writes the following in his work “Indus treaty: A different view”:
One can immediately see how differences arise. One party can claim to be in full conformity with the criteria laid down in the treaty, and the other party can say that this is not the case.
In the first place, as pointed out by Iyer, the treaty is highly technical leading to far ranging divergences between the two countries in terms of interpretations. For instance, while the treaty says that storage systems can be built but to a limited extent, the technical details makes it increasingly difficult to conclude under what circumstances projects can be carried out.
Added to this inherent limitation within the treaty is the political situation between the two countries. As per the writings of Iyer, while India on the one hand tries to make maximum use of the breathing space provided by the treaty to build projects on the western rivers, Pakistan on account of its suspicions towards India keeps an extra keen eye on every technical aspect of the project and tries its absolute best to get it suspended.
What is the ongoing conflict about?
The current conflict is over the Kishenganga dam project and the Ratle hydroelectric project. The Kishenganga hydroelectric plant is a $864 million worth of project that was initiated in 2007 and was projected to be completed by 2016. Pakistan took the project to the Court of Arbitration in 2010 raising six issues that they say violate the treaty. In 2013, the Court of Arbitration ruled India to go ahead with the project under the condition that a minimum water flow to Pakistan of 9 cubic metres per second is maintained. On several other issues however, no agreement between the two countries could be reached.

The 850 MW Hydroelectric power station named Ratle was initiated in June 2013 on the Chenab river. While laying the foundation stone of the project, former prime minister Manmohan Singh had said that it will help in the development of Jammu and Kashmir. However, Pakistan had once again raised objection at a meeting of the Indus commission held in September 2013. to the project on grounds of violation to the IWT.
Following the Uri attack in September 2016, India decided to not hold a meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission so long as Pakistan does not stop funding terrorist activities. The decision led to further delay in concluding the future of the two projects. With India now agreeing to hold the Permanent Indus Commission meeting, an agreement over the two projects is much awaited.

Congress on Friday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Uri terror attack, holding him “singularly responsible for the complete disarray” in the government’s policy vis-à-vis Pakistan, and dared him to act against Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar for “a massive intelligence and operational failure”.
“The Uri terrorist attack, which has been propagated, planned and executed by Pakistan, is the result of failure of the political leadership of the Modi government. Reports clearly point towards a massive intelligence and operational failure inside the government,” Congress’ chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters.

He asked Modi to show courage of conviction by fixing responsibility and accountability for this “complete failure”.
“India’s borders & National Security has been under siege for last 2 years. Def Min. should be held accountable (sic),” he tweeted earlier in the day.
Surjewala said yesterday’s terror strike on an Army base in which 18 soldiers were killed “is an attack on our national conscience and perpetrators of the attack should be brought to book at the earliest”.
He took a swipe at the government’s policy vis-à-vis Pakistan and said it should approach the international community for imposing comprehensive sanctions on Pakistan which harbours global terror network and uses terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

“Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi consistently counselled the Congress government to ‘stop writing love letters to Pakistan’. Modiji used the oft-quoted rhetoric of ’56-inch chest’ as also ‘bringing 10 heads back in lieu of one’, besides asking the government to ‘answer Pakistan in the language they understand’.
“Time has come for us to remind Narendra Modi of his ‘jumlas’ and rhetoric once again. Since becoming the Prime Minister of the country, Modi has indulged in saree-shawl diplomacy to impromptu visits to Pakistan to attend wedding celebrations and birthday parties with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif,” he said.
“The truth is that the Modi government’s Pakistan policy is based on wholesale confusion rather than pragmatic and decisive cohesion.
“Modi is singularly responsible for this complete disarray of foreign policy wherein a renegade, pariah nation like Pakistan, which is harbinger of global terror network and which stood isolated amongst international community on account of sustained policy of the Congress-led UPA government, is trying to project itself on international arena as a player for regional stability in Southeast Asia,” he said.
Surjewala said India’s borders and national security “have been under siege for last two years”.
“There have been over 900 border ceasefire violations by Pakistan in J&K. India has borne the brunt of unchecked terrorist attacks coming from Pakistan in Udhampur, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Pampore leading to heavy casualties of Army and police, including senior most officers,” he told reporters.

“After the grave provocation of terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase, the Modi government invited a Pakistani investigation team to Pathankot headed by the dreaded ISI. Pakistan not only brashly refused to permit a bilateral visit of Indian investigating team, it shockingly accused India of engineering the Pathankot airbase attack and killing its own soldiers,” he said.
He said the Modi government “appears to have learnt no lessons” which finally resulted in the cowardly Uri attack.
He also questioned why the government did not take preventive measures to pre-empt the Uri attack if there was information available from different agencies.
“Modi government needs to answer as to why no preventive measures were taken to pre-empt the Uri terror attack if there was credible information available from different agencies and security experts, more so considering the vulnerability of the Uri Brigade area and also its proximity to Line of Control,” he said.
Surjewala also sought to know why the soldiers were housed in tents when two military buildings were vacant.
“Why were soldiers housed in tents when two military buildings were vacant and available, which led to casualties? Who leaked information regarding troop movement and changeover, that is that the 10-Dorgra Regiment was in the process of making space for 6-Bihar Regiment? Isn’t it not a clear cut failure of command and control structure in the Modi government,” he asked.
Taking a dig at Parrikar, he said the Defence Minister is “busy threatening fellow Indians like Aamir Khan” and asked whether the priorities have gone wrong for the government.
“He (Parrikar) is busy attacking fellow Indians and passing intemperate remarks against everybody rather than doing his own responsibility. The responsibility, if any, lies at the doorsteps of the Modi government and at doorsteps of Manohar Parrikar, the Defence Minister of the country, who has proved himself to be a utter and complete failure,” Surjewala said.
In one of the deadliest attacks on the Army in recent years, 17 jawans were killed and 19 others injured as heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the force in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours yesterday.
Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed by the Army.
Surjewala said the government must also take appropriate steps at the international fora so that Pakistan is declared as a “terrorist state”.
Replying to a question, he said, “The government must tell the people of the country about the complete and total operational and intelligence failure. Any investigation that needs to take place must take place, but it should not be for the purpose of brushing issues under the carpet which is usually done by the Modi government.”
“More so, we demand responsibility and accountability must be fixed,” he said.
Asked if Congress will back action like what the USA did in case of Osama bin Laden, Surjewala said, “The government has to take a call on what kind of operational action it will take. Whatever action is taken, which is in the national interest and against terrorists and those who patronise them…not only Indian National Congress, all parties will support the government.”
Asked if Congress sees any link between India raising the Balochistan issue and the Uri attack, he said, “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is very much an integral part of India and if there are human rights violations in Balochistan and if the Army there has been accused of mass rapes, that’s an issue which successive Indian governments have raised from time to time. To link the terror attack coming from Pakistan to the Balochistan issue is uncalled for. Responsibility lies at the doorsteps of the Government of India to protect its borders as also its citizens.”
Asked whether the Centre should grant asylum to exiled Baloch leader Brahamdagh Bugti, he said, “The government will have to take note of the same. I am certain that in accordance with our procedures as also our stand on national and international fora, the government will take an appropriate call on the issue.”
Attacking Parrikar, he said, “Will Prime Minister show courage of conviction and fixing responsibility and accountability for this complete failure, particularly that of his Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who is more of a Swayamsevak, than holding the serious and responsible position of the Defence Minister of the country?”
He said on behalf of the people of India, Congress calls upon Modi to traverse the distance from ‘rhetoric’ to ‘reality’, from ‘projection of self’ to ‘protection of national interest’.
“Uri terror attack demands a firm and appropriate response from Indian Government to punish the guilty,” he said."

Many from the film fraternity have taken a stand against Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray’s diktat that makers who had cast Pakistani actors in their films have to donate Rs 5 crore to army welfare fund. Ajay Devgn joined the chorus on Tuesday when he said in Delhi that a decision such as this should be taken by filmmakers on their own accord.

Speaking at an event to promote Shivaay, Ajay said, “I think this shouldn’t happen. Everything that you want to do should come from within. Nobody should pressure us or anyone to do something. You can just guide but can’t force. It is just like how we treat our children in today’s life. We do not tell them what to do, we can’t do that. Similarly, this donation of Rs 5 crore for army welfare should be done out of choice but not because of the pressure building up,” Ajay said in a press conference.

However, at this moment, he feels responsible for standing up for the country. “Industry is not divided into two different parts. Nobody is standing for the ban on Pakistani actors. I said this earlier too, we all want to work together but it is the demand of the present situation. I think like they (Pakistani actors) have stood for their country, we should do too.

In fact, Karan Johar was also asked to display a tribute to Uri martyrs as the first slide of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Similarly, there were reports that even Ajay Devgn will pay tribute to Uri martyrs in Shivaay. Speaking about this, Ajay said, “This wasn’t my statement that I will showcase a slide in the honour of the Uri attack soldiers. It was a decision taken by Indian film association that they want to do this. I had no idea about this but when they asked me about it, I instantly agreed. I am just going by whatever the film association has said. I support them.”

On being asked if the industry should stay away from politics, Ajay said Bollywood has maintained its distance but politics somehow comes in their way. He added, “We put our heart and souls into a film for almost one or two years. We do not want to create controversy. If we had to do it, why will we work for better films? We love when our work is appreciated but when any controversy happens, the attention automatically shifts from the film and it really hurts.”

A police checkpost was attacked by terrorists at Langate in Handwara, North Kashmir, according to news agency ANI. News channel NDTV reported that the terrorists opened fire at the checkpost late Monday evening. No casualties have been reported so far.
On Sunday, four terrorists attacked an Army camp in Uri sector, killing 18 Army personnel. The four terrorists were killed in the encounter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised a strong and swift response to the terrorist attack. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh blamed Pakistan for the attack after initial investigations revealed that the assault rifles used by the terrorists had Pakistani marking. Jasih-e-Mohammed is believed to be behind the Uri attack. The prime minister chaired a high-level meeting Monday that was attended by Rajnath, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, National Security advisor Ajit Doval and Army chief Dalbir Singh. Sources said that India is planning to launch a a concerted global effort to diplomatically isolate Pakistan.

With the government demanding an apology from Ghulam Nabi Azad over his remarks in the Rajya Sabha yesterday on demonetisation, the Congress Party on Friday came out in defence of its Leader of Opposition and said that he has said nothing wrong but expressed pain over the causalities. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla asserted that there was nothing wrong in Azad’s assertion and said that there was no need for him to tender an apology.

“What was wrong in the comments of Ghulam Nabi Azad that he will apologise? He expressed pain over the deaths, which took place in the wake of demonetisation. There was nothing wrong in his comments,” he added.
Union Human Resource and Development (HRD) Minister Prakash Javadekar yesterday demanded an apology from Azad for accusing the government of burdening the public with wrong policy and alleging that the deaths due to demonetisation are higher as compared to those killed in the Uri terror attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Javadekar while addressing the media here condemned Azad’s comments and alleged that the anti-black money Congress is getting frustrated as such comments exude its anxiety.
“Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, must apologise to the people of the nation because he gave certificate to Pakistan by saying that the people who have died in the last few days are more than the people who died in Pakistan terror attack. This is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable,” said Javadekar.
“This shows that how the Congress is completely anti the black money decision. They are unsettled and their frustration is getting exposed by such utterances,” he added.
Meanwhile, the demonetisation war continued in the Parliament today with the Opposition seeking an explanation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi while questioning his absence. Amid chaotic scenes, the Lok Sabha was adjourned till Monday while the Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till 2: 30 p.m."

The latest attack on India by fidayeen groups has pushed India-Pakistan relations to the edge again. As India takes up the issue of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and the neighbour’s support to terror nurseries on the global platform, another attack on the India, particularly on the armed forces, is clearly testing New Delhi’s patience. India will need to relook its security policy if such incidents are to be stopped.
On Sunday, a four-man Fidayeen squad, suspected to be from Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad, attacked an Indian infantry installation in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri town, barely a few kms from the LoC. In one of the worst attacks against the Indian Army, 17 army jawans were killed and 19 others left critically injured. The four attackers were killed by the armed forces. Preliminary investigation by the security forces shows their weapons to bear Pakistani markings, again raising the issue of Pakistan’s open support to terrorists for carrying out attacks on India soil apparently to destabilise the security situation in the Kashmir valley.
Fidayeen attackers have increasingly begun targeting Indian security forces and their installations to disrupt any progress towards peace in Jammu and Kashmir.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he intended to bring the perpetrators to justice while Home Minister Rajnath Singh was quick to show disappointment with “terrorist state” Pakistan questioning the cross-border terrorism that it appears to be inflicting on India. Singh called Pakistan a “terrorist state” which should be “identified and isolated” as such. “There are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped. I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,” he said.

The minister is well within his rights to question Pakistan’s motives and its role in spreading unrest and terrorism in India. In a matter of nine months, this is the second direct strike on a defence establishment in Kashmir. Another attack by Pakistani terror actors took place in June this year when a CRPF convoy was attacked leading to the death of eight personnel. These have also followed an extended spell of attacks on army convoys and military bunkers along with multiple ceasefire violations along the border, often to facilitate infiltration into India. India could have escalated these strikes on its soil to a war-like situation, but it chose not to act in haste. However, Pakistan has taken India’s stance as granted and appears to be pushing its luck.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi raises the issue of Pakistan’s atrocities in Balochistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir, there seems to be a clear ploy to divert the attention towards Kashmir. Time and again, India has chosen to keep Pakistan in the process and insisted that it arrests and neutralises terrorists in its territory. However, the neighbour has harboured terrorists found guilty of carrying out mass killings in India.
Pakistan seems to believe India won’t act strongly and give a befitting reply to the aggressors. However, it seems New Delhi’s patience might just be running out."

With Pakistan announcing to ban Indian television and radio programmes, Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Friday said films and TV serials along with sports can be a very “potent” means to improve bilateral ties. “Films and TV serials from both Countries can be a very potent source along with Sports to improve relations between both Countries (sic),” he tweeted. He said artistes on both sides can be best of ambassadors. “We must open dialogue with Pakistan and also not unnecessarily target Artists on both sides. They can be best of Ambassadors on both sides (sic),” Singh said in another tweet.

Recalling former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s words about Pakistan, he said, “Atal ji had rightly said we

don’t have an option of choosing our neighbours (sic).” On the clamour to ban Pakistani artistes in India, he

said, “I fully support Bollywood’s stand on Filmmakers. Why punish only Artists? Why not ban any kind of relationship with Pakistan (sic)?”
Pakistan’s media regulatory authority had yesterday announced to enforce a complete ban on Indian TV and radio

contents from today. It warned that the licences of those found guilty of violating the ban will be suspended. The ban extends to all Indian content on cable and radio being aired in Pakistan. The authority also decided to cancel one-sided rights given to Indian media by the Pervez Musharraf government in 2006.
India has made it clear there is no ban on Pakistani artistes, who are facing ire of political parties like MNS in

Maharashtra in the wake of Uri attack. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had yesterday assured filmmaker Karan Johar that the state government will ensure smooth release of his directorial project “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”, which is facing threat from MNS for featuring a Pakistani actor in it."

India and the European Union are negotiating reference to the Uri terror attack as well as mention of “State-sponsored” and “cross-border terrorism” in the joint statement to be released after the 14th India-European Union summit, top sources have told The Indian Express.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be meeting President of the European Council Donald Franciszek Tusk and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker at the summit, to be held here on Friday.
Sources said that while officials have expressed disappointment at the relatively muted response of the EU to the Uri attack on September 18 last year, it may be conveyed at the highest levels on Friday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Officials said that the two sides are likely to announce strengthening of institutional linkages between Indian agencies and their European Union counterparts, including Europol, for closer interaction and cooperation in counter-terrorism. They are also expected to identify relevant training programmes for capacity building of individuals on both sides working in the sphere of countering terrorism and violent extremism.
Government sources said that while counter-terrorism arrangements may be established by and through individual countries, the EU that brings together 28 States can articulate a common position on this. “There are concrete levers that are available to use to signal that resort to terrorism as state policy is not acceptable, and the two sides will discuss using some of them after developing an understanding,” a source said.
During the 13th India-EU summit in Brussels in March last year, which Modi visited just days after the terror attack in the Belgian capital, the two sides had condemned the attacks in Brussels and Paris, Pathankot and Gurdaspur. While also recalling the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, the leaders had called for perpetrators of these attacks to be brought to justice. They had called for decisive actions against ISIL (Da’esh), Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network and other internationally active terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates.
On Friday, the two sides will also discuss domestic cyber policy landscape, cyber threats and mitigation, Internet governance, mechanism on bilateral cooperation and possible cooperation at various international fora and regional fora. They will also discuss possible collaboration for the 5th Global Conference on Cyber Space to be held in New Delhi from November 23-24."

Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, who made her Bollywood debut with Shah Rukh Khan starrer Raees last year, says the Hindi film industry was never her aim. Raees released in January 2017, just a few months after tensions intensified between India and Pakistan over the September 18, 2016 Uri attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead and the September 28 surgical strikes by India on Pakistan terror camps.
Mahira spoke about the impact of the tensions on the countries’ film industries on “HARDtalk on BBC World News”. Raees did not release in Pakistan. And Mahira was not allowed to promote the film in India as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena gave an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave the country and to keep away from its showbiz.
“At that time I was angry. I was sad and angry and there were moments of disappointment and just hurt, you know. Now I’ve come to a place where I believe that anger doesn’t really make me a better actor. It doesn’t do anything for me as a person, so I’ve let go of that, because at that time I was in the mix of it,” said Mahira.
Didn’t it stall her career in a way?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Bollywood was never really the aim actually. I mean sure you could argue that I could have done more films there, for sure I could have. But right after Raees, I had already started working on (Pakistani film) ‘Verna’, even before all of this happened. My focus was always Pakistan,” she said.
She said people may perceive that it was a “big jolt” to her career — and it was — but she has moved on. “Currently I just feel it’s just something else to be working and be part of this movement of the film industry (in Pakistan) at the moment.
“Because how I look at it, is that 20 years from now when either my son or kids from today want to become actors, we would have set this industry for them, which they won’t have to struggle so much,” added the 33-year-old actress, who has a son named Azlaan.
Her film Verna which is based on the rape culture and politics in Pakistan, has reportedly rubbed many in Pakistan the wrong way. With a strong problem of freedom to express getting suppressed in Pakistan, has she ever considered shifting base to another country?
Mahira Khan replied, “I don’t think that I can tell any story better than the story of my own country, than the stories of my own countrymen. I want to be able to bring out stories like ‘Verna’, as well as stories which are of the modern and new generation like ‘Ho Mann Jahaan’, which is a film I did of the youth of Pakistan.

Days after the Indian Army announced it had carried out surgical strikes against seven terror launch pads along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, a top official of the country’s security establishment has told The Indian Express that “if provoked again, we will amend our operational tactics”.
Sending Pakistan a tough message, the official, who was closely involved in planning the surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, said: “The surprise element in such an operation is key to its success and there will be no predictable repetition. If provoked yet again, we will amend our operational tactics. And for the time being, the continuing denial of Pakistan that there were no surgical strikes is a stance that suits us.”

 
Details are slowly trickling in about the timing and nature of the attack in which, officials said, an estimated 45-50 militants, mostly belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba, may have been killed or grievously injured. The largest number of fatalities were in the Lipa area of PoK, followed by Kel and Bhimber.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
No effort was, however, made and no time was lost by members of the commando teams in counting the casualties. A key official said, “The ferocity of the attack was such and the surprise element so complete that it was unlikely, many militants would have survived. The fact is that there was no retaliation whatsoever and the only setback to the operation was a mine-blast injury suffered by one commando.”
Before the strike, specific intelligence and intercepts had been received that these launch pads — semi-built structures which have since been substantially damaged in the attack by rocket launchers and grenade launchers — were almost fully occupied and that the militants were waiting for the moonless night of September 30, or amavasya, to ingress.

The intelligence inputs had given a clear signal that military targets were to be hit again, barely two weeks after the September 18 Uri attack in which 18 soldiers were killed.
The Indian side had also factored in the dark night period while deciding when to strike at the militant hideouts snuggling the LoC. The fact that the United Nations General Assembly session ended on September 26 and by September 28, Pakistan looked isolated as the host of the November SAARC summit, were other factors that came into play. The surgical strikes may, thus, have been advanced by a day or two.
With the commando teams, numbering close to 150 personnel, already transported near the LoC, probably two days in advance, tactical details of the stealth operation were continuously repeated.
The Indian Express has learnt that the precise timing for the attack was pre-fixed and everything was planned backward. With the seven commando teams needing varying time to reach their targets — depending on the terrain and distance — the assault teams were launched from Indian territory on a staggered schedule so that the strikes could be simultaneous and swift."

Donald Trump has asserted that the US needs to be “very careful” about radical Islamic terror and “extreme vetting” must be done before allowing people in to the country, a controversial stand taken by the Republican presidential nominee that has made immigrants jittery. Outlining his policy to tackle terrorism, the 70-year-old billionaire said, “We have to be very, very careful (about radical Islamic terror). We have to have extreme vetting before we let people in… We want people to come in to the country but they have to come in legally.”

“Something is going on that’s not positive force. We are going to be looking very much at certain areas of the world. We have to very careful with radical Islamic terror. We can be politically correct and say it doesn’t matter but it does matter,” he told NDTV when asked if he has given up his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.

Trump also spoke about the Indo-Pak conflict, saying, “There’s a tremendous conflict between India and Pakistan.

Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh on Tuesday said he strongly condemns the Uri attack in which 19 soldiers were killed by the terrorists. Now, a critical situation prevails all over the country.
Digvijay Singh said, “The Congress party has always supported the soldiers and we also respect all our Indian defence forces. The Congress party never played bad politics on national dignity.”

India carried out surgical strike on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on the intervening night of September 28 and 29, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
“The Congress has always supported defence forces and has immense respect towards them. The Congress doesn’t do politics in the subjects which are of national importance like former prime minister Gujral who always commented badly about the UPA government and Manmohan Singh,” Singh said.
“We should do whatever we can to thwart Pakistani’s effort to defame India in the UN and other international forums,” he added.

When the US and the UK asked Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to condemn the attack on the Indian Army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, he flatly refused to denounce the assault.
According to the News International, both the world powers asked Sharif to condemn the attack, which left 19 Indian soldiers dead, during the premier’s meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Prime Minister Theresa May at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
WATCH VIDEO: Nawaz Sharif’s Envoys Warn US, Say Pakistan Will Move Towards China, Russiahttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
 

According to sources, Sharif instead countered the two leaders over their silence regarding the unrest in the Kashmir Valley since July 9, which has claimed the lives of nearly 90 persons.
The sources said Sharif maintained that Islamabad could not condemn the attack, which India has blamed on Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, and the death of the security personnel when “India had no regret over its atrocities and brutalities” in the valley.
Sharif said that the world, including London and Washington, had turned a blind eye to the killing of Kashmiris in clashes with the security forces after the killing of Hizbul militant Burhan Wani in July.

 
Pakistan categorically rejected the Indian allegations of Islamabad’s involvement in the Uri attack.
However, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan offered full cooperation to probe the incident as it believed the attack was either an “Indian false flag operation” carried out to malign Pakistan and divert the world attention from Kashmir issue or it was a “retaliatory attack by the oppressed Kashmiris who are facing the worst form of brutalities from the Indian state terrorism”.
“With such a clear stance on Kashmir, expecting from the Pakistani premier to condemn the Uri attack and killing of Indian soldiers is really unfair and irrational,” another source said."

THE STAGE is set for the BJP National Council. Party flags line the roads of the city, huge posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah, party chief ministers and party idealogue Deendayal Upadhyay welcome delegates, and the stage is decorated with Kerala’s indigenous art forms. But the Uri terror attack has cast a shadow, as there is uncertainty about the programme.
Party sources said the tension at the border and the high-level meetings at the Centre have left the organisers unsure about the final schedule. And amid the calls for action against Pakistan, from both party leaders and cadres, top leaders are also mulling over the wording of the political resolution, to be approved at the National Council meeting on Sunday.

A party general secretary said the political resolution would certainly have a reference to the Uri attack, Pakistan and Kashmir. All eyes are on Modi’s speech at a rally on Kozhikode beach on Saturday, his first public address since the Uri attack on September 18.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Uri attack has already forced some changes in the programme.
The time period for the National Council meeting has been shrunk — it will now be held on Sunday, from 10 am to 5 pm, with a two-hour lunch break in between. The Prime Minister is likely to address the National Council at 4 pm on Sunday, when he will also launch Deendayal Upadhyay’s birth centenary celebrations.
An office-bearers’ meeting will begin on Friday afternoon and conclude by Saturday.
According to a senior BJP leader, the Prime Minister’s programme is not finalised. “If there is any development at the border, he will have to be in Delhi,” said a general secretary.
Another change post-Uri is that the organisers have added an item to the programme. A play on nationalism, directed by Malayalam film director Ali Akbar, will be staged on Saturday evening.
Sources said while the political resolution will focus on Deendayal Upadhyay’s integral humanism and the government’s proposed and ongoing gareeb kalyan schemes, it will reflect the BJP’s stand on Pakistan and India’s reaction to the Uri attack.
“There could be a demand from the party to take a strong stand on Pakistan, but the resolution is unlikely to refer to military action. The demand could be to isolate Pakistan and continue pressure on it to end its support to terror outfits,” said the leader.
The resolution will also extend the party’s support to the Modi government’s approach on Pakistan and will laud the steps taken by the government — like building pressure at the international level against Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the choice of venue is significant — while the politics in the Malabar region has so far been dominated by the Muslim League and Communists, the BJP’s decision is a clear indication of its next focus area."

AS PRIME Minister Narendra Modi received visiting Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport on Tuesday — for the second time in less than a year, signalling warmth in ties — New Delhi is looking to raise the issue of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)’s repeated statements on Kashmir with the visiting leader.
Sources in the government told The Indian Express that UAE is an influential voice in OIC, and India wants to impress upon the country’s top leadership that its statements on Kashmir are “counter-productive” and boosts morale of terror groups and pro-militant elements in the Valley.

“We want to impress upon them during the visit that the same elements which were responsible for killing five of their (UAE’s) diplomats in Kandahar on earlier this month (January 10) are (also) responsible for the violence and terrorist activities in Kashmir,” a top government source said. “Through our conversations, we will tell them that such OIC declarations only strengthen the hands of those forces, which disrupt peace in the country.
“We understand some of these diplomats were friends and relatives of some of the members of the delegation…we hope they will be receptive to our concerns.” India had last year raised the issue of OIC’s stand on Kashmir when Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, whose country is also a key OIC member, visited India. But there has not been any visible change in Egypt’s stance at the OIC so far, officials said.
New Delhi’s public position has been that OIC countries had no locus standi in Kashmir, and senior officials have said there was a gap between what some of these countries convey to India in private and the stance of the organisation as such. Pakistan has been using the OIC to mobilise international opinion against India on the Kashmir issue.
Sources indicated that the UAE, among the first countries to have condemned the Pathankot terror attack last year, will make common cause once again on the terror attack at Uri in Jammu & Kashmir. A mention of the Kandahar terror attack, in which UAE diplomats were killed, is “highly expected” along with the Uri attack, a source privy to the drafting of the joint statement said.

There is a distinct possibility of a reference to the “surgical strikes” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir along the LoC, sources said.
New Delhi and Abu Dhabi will sign a Strategic Cooperation Agreement, along with more than a dozen pacts, on Wednesday after the talks between Modi and Al Nahyan. This includes one on $75 billion investment fund, committed by the UAE. Stressing that the decision to elevate the bilateral ties to strategic level had already been taken, MEA’s Secretary (Economic Relations) Amar Sinha said, “We are still signing an agreement which is more like an action plan, (and) which thrashes out of the idea of strategic partnership and brings out concrete idea of what both sides are committed to do.”
Modi and Al Nahyan will hold one-on-one meeting at the Prime Minister’s official residence before proceeding to Hyderabad House for delegation-level talks, Sinha said.
Emphasising that UAE has the largest sovereign fund and is looking at investment, Sinha said there was an agreement that the country would invest nearly $75 billion in India in the next couple of years. The visiting Crown Prince is the chief guest at the Republic Day function this year."

Subham Dutta
IT’S RARE, if ever, that you come across non-religious slogans at Gangasagar. Deep in the south of West Bengal, Sagar Island on the delta where the Ganga, or Hooghly, flows into the Bay of Bengal, is a place known more for the Sagar mela that attracts thousands of pilgrims each winter.
Tuesday was different. Patiently waiting with Tricolours of varying sizes, hundreds of people from across the island spoke out together the moment they sighted an Air Force helicopter. “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”. The chopper carried the body of Sepoy Biswajit Gorai, one of the 18 soldiers killed in Sunday’s terror attack on an Army base camp in Uri, Kashmir.
Besides tens of locals, senior officers from the Army, state police, civil administration and political leaders were present at the helipad. The lane leading to their small home being too small for a vehicle to be steered through, officers carried the coffin to Gorais’ home, in Surjovrinda village near the helipad. The slain soldier’s family members – father Rabindranath Gorai, mother Rekha and sister Bulti – were too traumatised to leave home.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Biswajit’s mother and sister fainted at the sight of the coffin. The body was kept at their home for about 15 minutes and then taken for the last rites. Besides senior Army officers, West Bengal’s Fire and Emergency Services Minister Sovan Chatterjee, local MLA Bamkim Hazra and Superintendent of Police (South 24 Parganas) Sunil Kumar Choudhury were among hundreds of people present.
His brother Ranajit Gorai said, “I also wanted to get into the Army but was rejected due to the height criterion. After Chhotu (Biswajit) got through, he used to tease me jokingly – he often said he was the luckiest among us. I now wish it was me, and not him.”
Rana Biswas, a neighbour, said Biswajit was the family’s only earning member. “They do not know what will happen now,” Biswas said. In a distance, minister Sovan Chatterjee asked the local authorities to extend every possible help to the family.
Recalling that Sepoy Gorai had left the village for Uri exactly a month ago – on August 21 – Samir Paria, a friend, said, “He left with two handbags, and a smile. His parents and sister had come up to the main road to see him off. Now his coffin is being taken through the same lane.” This time, it seemed the whole island had come to see him off."

The Uri attacks have returned India-Pakistan relations to an old and familiar groove. India blames Pakistani terrorists. Pakistan denies the charge, instead proposing that India’s oppression in Kashmir fuelled the attack on the army camp. This clash of narratives is unlikely to end. But as India contemplates its response, it may be worthwhile to look at how the world of scholars is analysing the relationship between the Pakistani state and its non-state armed groups.
For a long time, it has been observed that many states defy Max Weber’s theory that modern states seek a monopoly over the means of coercion and do not allow non-state groups to use violence. We know that states often don’t crush armed organisations, even if they can; or they liquidate some groups while protecting others. In light of this larger problem, the key puzzle about Pakistan is: Should Pakistan’s relationship with non-state terror groups be viewed as simply an illustration of a larger problem that many states encounter, or is Pakistan sui generis with few relevant comparisons?
In a body of emerging work, Paul Staniland (University of Chicago) argues that Pakistan is not the only country to have collaborated with non-state armed groups. The Indian state of Chhattisgarh protected and deployed a para-military group (Salwa Judum) against its Maoist insurgents, and Delhi collaborated with non-state groups to deal with the insurgents in the Northeast too. Similar examples can be cited from Iraq, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burma’s Shan state etc. Yelena Biberman (Skidmore College), another scholar working on the outsourcing of security to non-state groups, argues roughly in the same vein, drawing comparisons between how Turkey has dealt with the Kurdish rebels and how India used Ikhwan-ul Muslimoon in its counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir in the 1990s and later. Indeed, the problem is not only about collaboration. As we know, over the last few years, Pakistan has launched a brutal military assault against those terrorist groups that attack the Pakistani state, such as the Pakistani Taliban, but it has protected terrorist organisations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba that attack India, or groups like the Afghan Taliban that violently seek to undermine the elected governments of Afghanistan. Staniland explores why this is so. The divergence is driven by two sets of factors: The ideological correspondence between the state and the armed group, and the operational utility of the armed organisation. By this logic, Pakistan would consistently support LeT and the Afghan Taliban because both of these organisations share the state’s ideology and are operationally strong, but its support for Jaish-e-Mohammed would be inconsistent, because the latter organisation also attacks Pakistani groups that have nothing to do with India, and the Pakistani army would wish to decimate the Pakistani Taliban because their target is the Pakistani state itself. Commitment to Islam is not the sole issue. Such a commitment must also be conjoined to a strong opposition to India and to the project of dominating Afghanistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This comparative argument about Pakistan is pitted against those who contend that Pakistan’s relationship with non-state actors is virtually unparalleled. In Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army’s Way of War, Christine Fair (Georgetown University) argues that Pakistan is ideology-driven, not security-driven. A standard security calculus, emphasising the primacy of national interest and a calibration of costs and benefits, would have demonstrated the necessity of compromise with India. But Fair writes: “For Pakistan’s men on horseback, not winning, even repeatedly, is not the same thing as losing. Simply giving up and accepting the status quo and India’s supremacy, is, by definition, defeat.”
Pakistan’s army sees victory , says Fair, simply “as the ability to continue fighting”, regardless of consequences for the nation’s development, welfare or international opinion. It is hard to find such states in history. Fair’s explanation of how Pakistan’s army distinguishes between good and bad terrorists is also different from Staniland’s. The bad ones are not only those who have turned against the Pakistani state and army, especially the Pakistani Taliban (as distinct from the Afghan Taliban), but also those who are inspired by the Deobandi religious tradition. The good terrorists, in contrast, are not only those opposed to India, but also ones inspired by the Al-Hadith tradition, which seeks Muslim unity and is not out to attack minority Muslim sects such as the Shias, or syncretistic Islamic groups such as the Sufis. Deobandi organisations violently attack the latter groups as heretics or apostates, but Al-Hadith organisations, such as the Lashkar-i-Taiba, do not.
Whichever argument is correct, the implications are serious. The first implication is for the liberal approaches to understanding Pakistan.
Liberals have resolutely believed that enhancing people-to-people exchanges, experiencing cultural similarities and expanding trade with Pakistan would build the foundations of peace. It is not that such exchanges should be abandoned, but one should clearly see their limits. An argument about the re-discovery of a shared culture runs up against the very foundations of the Pakistani state.
In a famous exchange in the 1940s, Maulana Azad had argued that Pakistan was unnecessary because Muslims and Hindus, though religiously distinct, had the same Indian culture. Mohammed Ali Jinnah’s argument was the opposite. Not only were Hindus and Muslims culturally distinct, but the preservation of Muslim culture, Jinnah said, required a separate state. It is Jinnah’s argument that became the basis for Pakistan. One can see why a discourse about cultural similarities can only threaten the state in Pakistan and its army will never allow it to become the dominant discourse. Maulana Azad can’t possibly become a Pakistani hero.
When anti-Indianism is constitutive, it can’t easily be expelled. That being so, should one believe that Pakistan’s army would give up its relationship with non-state terror groups that call India their incorrigible enemy? That can happen if such groups, to use Staniland’s argument, lose their operational utility. The strategic community in India may have to think seriously about how to make that happen. It would also help if Delhi repairs its relationship with Kashmir. Nothing lends greater strength to Pakistan’s army and terrorist organisations than unrest in Kashmir. Nothing lends greater unity to Pakistan’s deeply fractured polity and society than protests in Kashmir — not even Islam. Expected to be its cultural glue, Islam has actually been Pakistan’s source of interminable religious conflict."

The US has asked Pakistan to cooperate with India in probing the terror attack on an army base in Kashmir’s Uri town, a State Department official said Wednesday. US Secretary of State John Kerry met Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the UN and “the two discussed the incident. The Secretary urged Pakistani cooperation in the investigation,” the State Department official told PTI on condition of anonymity.

The US, the official said, is awaiting further information as to who were behind these attacks and has offered its assistance to India on this.
“We are still awaiting further information. We have offered our assistance to the government of India, and we also urge Pakistan to cooperate in the ongoing investigation,” the State Department official said."

Pakistan on Sunday rejected as “totally baseless and irresponsible” allegations by India that it was behind the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri that killed 17 Indian soldiers, saying India has a “history of blaming Pakistan” immediately after a terror strike. Following the dawn strike, India had criticised Pakistan for the latest attack on the Indian Army. Home Minister Rajnath Singh directly blamed Pakistan saying it was a “terrorist state” and should be isolated.
Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria in an interview to a TV channel said the Indian allegations against Pakistan are “totally baseless and irresponsible”.
“Pakistan always sought concrete evidence from India to prove its accusations, but it failed to do so,” he said, “India has a history of blaming Pakistan immediately after a terror attack, which always proved wrong in investigations”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Zakaria said “India is using different tactics to divert the world attention from the situation in Kashmir”. The Pakistan Army had earlier demanded “actionable intelligence” to support India’s accusation. Pakistan army spokesman Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa said that following the attack Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two countries discussed the situation along the Line of Control through hotline.
“Refuting the unfounded and premature Indian allegation,  Pakistani DGMO asked his counterpart to share any actionable intelligence,” Radio Pakistan reported citing an ISPR release. Pakistani DGMO rejected allegations of cross border infiltration and said that “watertight arrangements” were in place on both sides of the LoC and the Working Boundary. He also asked India to share evidence.
Heavily-armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Indian Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the attack in which all four terrorists were neutralised."

In a strong message to Pakistan ahead of his first bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the surgical strikes carried out by the Indian Army along the Line of Control last year did not elicit any adverse response from the international community and that terrorists have “explained terrorism” to the entire world. And in jest, he said those who suffered from the surgical strikes had a different story to tell.
He also mentioned the case of the recently rescued Indian woman, Uzma, in Pakistan. But he did raise eyebrows when he linked her religion to her decision to travel to Pakistan.
“You would have heard that an Indian girl went to Malaysia, met someone there. She went from India to Pakistan. She carried dreams with her but her life was ruined there. She is a Muslim. She thought if I go to Pakistan, my life will be made. But she landed in trouble. Then she decided she had to get to the Indian embassy there to save herself,” Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
(“Abhi aapne dekha hoga, Bharat ki ek bachchi Malaysia mein gayi thi, kisi ke parichay mein aayi. Bharat se Pakistan chali gayi. Bahut sapne lekar ke gayi thi. Lekin wahan pe uski zindagi barbad ho gayi. Musalman bachchi thi. Usko laga Pakistan jaaongi, meri zindagi bahut khush ho jayegi. Phans gayi. Tab usne man mein tai kiya ki mauka dekh kar Pakistan ke andar jo Hindustan ki embassy hai wahan pahunch jaaongi, meri zindagi surakshit ho jayegi.”)
Delhi-based Uzma was rescued in Pakistan by the Indian High Commission there after she complained of torture and harassment by her husband’s family.
Modi made these comments at an Indian community event in Washington DC at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. Unlike his previous such event at the Madison Square Garden, there were no banners, posters, drums or any sign of festivity outside the venue. Even inside the venue, chants of “Modi, Modi” and “Bharat Mata ki Jai” were not as raucous.
“This is Trump’s America, we need to be cautious and low-key,” one of the organisers said. Vijai Chauthaiwale, who heads a group called the Overseas Friends of BJP, said about 5,000 people registered to attend the event.
During his over 45-minute speech, Modi drew the loudest response when he spoke on the surgical strikes conducted after the Uri attack last September.
“When India talked of terrorism 20 years back, many in the world said it was a law and order problem and didn’t understand it. Now terrorists have explained terrorism to them, so we don’t have to,” Modi said.
He said India succeeded in telling the world about the need to uproot the menace of terrorism. “When India conducted surgical strikes, the world experienced our power and realised that India practices restraint but can show power when needed,” he said.
“The world did not and cannot stop us. We have succeeded in conveying to the world the deleterious effects of terrorism on India.”
“The entire world could have raised many questions and pointed fingers at us for the surgical strike. But not a single country questioned India’s surgical strike against terrorist launch pads in Pakistan. For those who suffered (Pakistan) because of this, it is a different thing,” he said.
Modi also took a swipe at China when he said that India believes in following the world order. “We are bound by international laws. We believe in the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family). This is our character. We do not want to disrupt the global order. Following international norms and law to ensure that sovereignty, security and peace is maintained, we are capable of taking very stern action.”
He said his government has remained untainted in the last three years. “The reasons governments have been defeated in India are things like corruption and cheating. People of India do not like corruption. I can say humbly today that there has not been a single taint on us during our three years of performance.”
Showering praise on External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and the Ministry of External Affairs for becoming “pro-people”, he said that he gets letters praising the embassies everyday. He said that the MEA has shown how to use the social media to resolve people’s grievances. The earlier image of an Indian diplomat, he said, was someone who was in “coat, pant, tie” and not “engaged with people”.
“If somebody in some corner of the world is in distress and they tweet, within 15 minutes, Sushma Swaraj responds and the government takes action within 24 hours,” he said.
Before the event began, audio-visual films highlighted achievements like the Goods and Services Tax, demonetisation, One-Rank-One-Pay, surgical strikes, missiles and black money. A musical video on Namami Ganga was also aired."

The deadly Uri terror attack is likely to cast its shadow over the three-day BJP National Council meet in Kozhikode starting on September 23. The dominant theme of the exercise so far was likely to be the party’s renewed emphasis on the ‘garib kalyan’ (poor’s welfare) agenda, besides reprising its ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s contribution in his birth centenary year.
The terror attack on an Army camp that killed 18 soldiers and saw outpouring of grief and anger, including from BJP leaders, may have changed the script. “Obviously there is palpable anger among our workers over the terror attack and they would be looking at the top party brass to send out a message. I am sure the leadership will touch on this issue of national security,” a senior party leader said.

Nationalism is a key plank of the saffron party and it has often used the theme of national security and terrorism to galvanise its cadres and corner opposition parties.  With the party facing criticism from certain quarters over terrorist attacks targeting security facilities during its government and lack of concrete action against Pakistan an issue over which it often taunted the UPA government, the sources said it is likely to use the event to reassure its cadres.
Some party leaders, including General Secretary Ram Madhav who Sunday batted for “for one tooth, the complete jaw” policy, have gone public seeking tough action against Pakistan. Its president Amit Shah has spelt out a more nuanced view, saying India’s fight against terrorism has reached a decisive stage and the government is moving in the right direction."

“If they work with any Pakistani artist, they should be prepared for a befitting response from us,” Khopkar told PTI.
The film workers association of the Raj Thackeray-led party had recently set a 48-hour deadline for all Pakistani artists working in India to leave the country.
“We gave a 48-hour deadline to Pakistani actors and artists to leave India or MNS will push them out,” Khopkar had

He had even threatened to beat up Pakistani artists and those who cast them in their productions. The MNS warning came in the wake of the heightened tension between the two nations, following the terrorist attack on an Amry camp in Uri in Kashmir in which 18 Army personnel were killed.

Express Photo by Partha Paul.
Within hours of the Uri attack Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the country that “those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished” while Home Minister Rajnath Singh called Pakistan “a terrorist state” which “should be identified and isolated”.
As Army chief General Dalbir Singh headed to Srinagar and Uri, President Pranab Mukherjee, who is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, condemned the “outrageous terrorist attack” and said “India will not be cowed down by such attacks, we will thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their backers”.
The Prime Minister is said to have been “terribly disturbed” on learning of the terrorist attack this morning. He spoke to Rajnath Singh and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar over the phone.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Parrikar cut short his Goa visit and rushed to Srinagar via New Delhi. “Condemn the cowardly terror attack on Army camp at Uri. I salute the brave martyrs for their supreme sacrifice,” he said before leaving for Srinagar.
The Prime Minister, in a statement, said: “We strongly condemn the cowardly terror attack in Uri. I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished. We salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families.”
“Raksha Mantri will go to J&K himself to take stock of the situation,” he said.

On the Prime Minister’s instructions, Rajnath Singh called a high-level meeting to assess the situation and take the latest briefing from the Army.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, chiefs of IB and R&AW and the DGMO briefed Singh who later gave a detailed brief to the Prime Minister.
A top level source echoed the Prime Minister and said: “The PM will surely and firmly take action to punish the perpetrators of terror.”
The government and the BJP have surmised that “Indian people will support whatever strong action India takes as deterrent to stop Pakistan from spreading terror across the border”.
However, those who are well-versed with the Prime Minister’s working style know that he is likely to respond to any grave event only at a time that suits him best.
A senior intelligence officer, who is part of the response team, told The Indian Express: “The surprising thing is why did Pakistan-based outfits make a tactical error of attacking India now? The terror attack on Indian soil is a tremendous disadvantage to Pakistan when the UNGA meet is just days away. It has, once more, internationalised their policy of using terror as a weapon in conducting diplomacy.”
Meanwhile, Rajnath Singh, who directed security forces to mount an all-out offensive against terrorists in the Valley, expressed “deep disappointment with Pakistan’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups”.
He said “there are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped”. He said those behind the attack will be brought to justice.
Cancelling a scheduled visit to the United States and Russia in view of the attack, the Home Minister also spoke to Jammu and Kashmir Governor N N Vohra and Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.
“I have given instructions to the Home Secretary and other senior officers in MHA to closely monitor the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Keeping the situation of Jammu and Kashmir in mind and in the wake of terror attack in Uri, I have postponed my visits to Russia and the USA,” Singh said in a series of tweets."

Mumbai, which has been on high alert since two schoolchildren spotted suspicious men in Uran, continues to remain under a tight security blanket.
“Though the Uran alert turned out to be a hoax, the city has been on high alert since the Uri attack and also because of the festive season, which will continue till Diwali. However, after the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Army, security has been intensified at vital installations, especially sensitive structures,” a senior official said.
The Navy too has put up a security cordon at all its bases. It has cancelled some events scheduled for the next few weeks. “In view of operational developments, certain activities of the Western Naval Command have been cancelled. These include ships being open to visitors originally scheduled for October 1 and 2 and NCC Cadets/ Sainik School/ School Childrens Day at sea, which was scheduled for October 3. Citizens are requested to disregard information regarding these events on hoardings which were put up earlier,” a Navu press release said."

ANIMAL PLANET: A war of the absurd broke out on TV, as Indian soaps turned to animals for help to boost their TRPs. On Sasural Simar Ka, the protagonist turned into a fly; a rockstar by day becomes a tiger by night in Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum and there were revenge-seeking snakes on shows such as Naagin 2 and Ichhapyaari Naagin.
THEME PLAY: Although most serials have little regard and space for what’s really happening in the world, this year saw some add current and topical news in their plots. Demonetisation was a popular theme on TV with shows such as Jamai Raja, Devanshi and Chidiya Ghar, among others, shooting entire episodes on it.
NO MORE FAWAD: When Zindagi channel first launched in the country, it was lauded and loved for giving us shows from Pakistan. Fresh faces and new scripts in good serials dominated the small screen. And then Subhash Chandra, founder of the network, pulled the plug on all things and people Pakistani after the Uri attack in September. No more Pakistani shows, he announced, and just like that the viewer had nothing but saas-bahu sagas to watch.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

TURKISH DELIGHTS: After nudging out Pakistani shows from their roster, Zindagi went further west with Turkey this year. So, there’s the never-ending Feriha and Fatmagul, and the cute antics of a nuclear family in Little Lord. The Hindi dubbed shows enjoy a considerable fan following in India and could be the best Hindi serials of the year!
NEWS IMPACT: Celebrated Hindi journalist Ravish Kumar blackened the TV screen during his 40-minute show, Prime Time on NDTV, during the JNU debacle. In another episode, he invited mime artistes to make a point on a 24-hour proposed government ban on NDTV India. Creative methods by one, and a much-talked-about exit by another. Times Now’s Arnab Goswami left the nation to join the Republic, all set to launch, when else but on January 26, 2017.
WEB STARS: For all the times we couldn’t relate to Indian serials, there were webseries. From Permanent Roommates 2, TVF Tripling, Alisha to the ongoing The Trip and Girl in the City – online content addressed complicated relationships, work pressure, singledom, and dynamics of female friendships. These shows also acquainted the viewers with web stars such as Sumeet Vyas, Amol Parashar, Mallika Dua and Mithila Palkar.

THE END: India’s longest running show, Ballika Vadhu finally ended its reign this year. What started as a story of a child bride in Rajasthan turned into a formulaic love story with familiar twists and turns. Anandi became a household name, and with that so did child actor Avika Gor. The only sad news for the show was the untimely death of Pratyusha, who played Anandi as a young woman.
REALITY OVERDOSE: Although new editions of almost all reality shows – Bigg Boss, India’s Got Talent, Jhalak Dikhla Jaa, Indian Idol – returned to TV, none really made an impact. Maybe 2016 should have seen them all take a break. In the comic space too, Comedy Nights with Kapil starring Kapil Sharma and its boring, sexist jokes ended, moved to another channel, and seems to have died without a laugh. Karan Johar returned to the couch with Koffee with Karan, with the same faces and speculations. Barring Twinkle Khanna, Katrina Kaif, and Dangal girls Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Sheikh, the show was a snooze fest. There was also Vogue BFFs, which got the rich and famous to fawn all over their closest buddy. And whatever happened to KBC?
FILMI FEVER: Those tired of watching Sooryavansham and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham on TV every weekend found respite in Zee Classic’s ‘Finest Films’ programming. Every Saturday night, the channel shows some of the best movies the industry has made – from Salaam Bombay, Party, Pestonji to Ek Doctor Ki Maut, Mirch Masala, and Mammo. The Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival in collaboration with Tata Sky aired selected films from the festival, such as Sairat, Chauthi Koot and Qissa, among others, on channel 302 and 303.

(Photo-PIB)
A day after 18 soldiers were killed in a terror attack on an Army camp in Uri, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and key ministers received counsel against rash military action at their first full-scale meeting Monday, government sources said.
Top military commanders warned that Pakistan’s army had raised its defensive posture along the Line of Control (LoC). Few details emerged from the meeting, but senior government figures pushed back against calls from their ranks for immediate military strikes against Pakistan.
The meeting, attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, however, heard from National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Army chief General Dalbir Singh on possible long-term options to retaliate against jihadist logistics and the Pakistani military infrastructure.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister briefed President Pranab Mukherjee on the discussions late Monday.
Indian Air Force chief Arup Raha, who is also chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, was not present at the main meeting, a sign some security experts took to signal that the government was not, at this stage, considering air strikes across the LoC.
Following the 26/11 strikes, the IAF had drawn up elaborate plans to carry out retaliatory attacks on jihad training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which it has rehearsed several times in liaison with the intelligence services.
Foreign diplomats based in New Delhi read the government’s decision to allow the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service to proceed as scheduled as another sign that India is not contemplating immediate escalation of hostilities along the LoC.
Watch Video: Uri Terror attack- Will India Retaliate?

General Dalbir Singh, military sources said, based his advice to the government on conversations with senior commanders in the field, who he visited Sunday. Though the Indian Army has prepared plans for strikes against jihadist infrastructure and military positions supporting them using special forces, he was told Pakistan had used the time since the Sunday morning strike in Uri to fortify its positions, making a counter-attack risky.
In addition, field commanders also expressed concern that even localised battles along the LoC, with Indian and Pakistani forward positions trading fire, could facilitate infiltration — thus helping jihadist groups already operating against the Army inside Kashmir.
A PTI report from Islamabad said Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif met his top commanders and said the military was “watchful” towards the security imperatives of the country in the wake of “a hostile narrative” by India following the Uri attack. A statement from Pakistan Army quoted its chief as saying that the “armed forces of Pakistan are fully prepared to respond to entire spectrum of direct and indirect threat”.
National Security Advisor Doval is believed to have separately discussed with the Prime Minister the options for non-conventional measures targeting the jihadist leadership. However, these were not discussed at the meeting, sources familiar with the discussions said.
For now, New Delhi has focused its strategy on gathering evidence New Delhi believes will be critical to legitimise any future military options it might exercise. National Investigation Agency detectives arrived in Uri late Monday, with their early effort focusing on recovering data from one of the two Garmin-manufactured Global Positioning Sets salvaged from the terrorists killed at the camp.
The Garmin eTrex set was scheduled to be flown to New Delhi late Monday for technical assessment by specialists of the Intelligence Bureau and National Technical Research Organisation.
“Even if some basic data can be recovered from the set,” a source familiar with the investigation said, “we shall request the United States for help with recovering more information from Garmin’s servers”.
Four Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists who attacked Poonch earlier this month, police sources said, used a similar Garmin set. Analysis of the set, the sources said, showed the group had begun their journey at the Halan camp near Forward Kahuta, in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Haveli district, crossing the LoC near the Betar nullah.
Incidentally, the intelligence community remains divided on the identity of the group which attacked the Army in Uri, with some experts in Military Intelligence and the Intelligence Bureau continuing to believe that the attackers belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director-General of Military Operations, had told reporters Sunday that “initial assessment” pointed to the Jaish-e-Muhammad — an opinion this newspaper had first reported to have been based on information from the Defence Intelligence Agency.
However, a matrix-sheet recovered from the terrorists — it is used to decrypt coded text passed between their control stations and field units inside Kashmir — closely resembles several others used by the Lashkar, intelligence sources told The Indian Express.
“This is one of the key issues the NIA is obviously going to have to address,” a source familiar with its investigation said. “The Army isn’t a criminal investigation organisation, but it’s important for the country that we be able to present an evidence-backed case to the international community,” the source said."

Meryl Streep’s powerful speech at the Golden Globes, to quote her own words ‘sank its hooks in my heart’. It also made me recall how our own award nites are nothing but blah. It is exactly what actor Govinda says it is: “One camp announces the award, another from the same camp receives it while a third one from their camp sits in the audiences and claps vigorously.” That’s a Bollywood awards night for you where nepotism rules supreme and God, along with corporate sponsors, find frequent mentions in thank you speeches. But never even once will anyone ever do what Meryl Streep did.

Will you ever see Karan Johar (an eloquent speaker) openly talking about the troubles he and Bollywood at large had to face from MNS, a political outfit that is not even in power? Shah Rukh Khan preferred a quiet settlement rather than taking the bull by its horns, which in the prevailing circumstances looked like a smart move. Their continued public silence emerges from the fact that every time they have aired their opinions on an issue that is political in nature, it has only earned them political wrath and calls for forcible bans on their films. Both Aamir and SRK have suffered for their statements on intolerance made in the past. Not wanting to invite anymore trouble, all major stars have now clamped up and adopted the ‘silence is golden’ method when faced with such questions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

But the issue of MNS propped up in the aftermath of the Uri attacks.
Questions asked by the press on public podiums about such issues are either disallowed or met with ‘no comments’ response. For those who feel like reacting, opt for the safe way out – record a video in the safe confines of their luxurious house and post it on Twitter. This provides them the immunity from speaking about it on a public platform. “I have already said what I wanted to on Twitter,” is their terse response if ever asked about it by the press. While to expect Bollywood stars to speak their mind out will remain a Utopian dream, what I couldn’t avoid noticing is how Streep’s speech could be a perfect one for SRK to address the Pakistan controversy at an upcoming awards nite. And here is how it should go with some minor changes.
“Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down. Please sit down. Thank you. I love you all. You’ll have to forgive me. I’ve lost my voice in screaming and lamentation this weekend. And I have lost my mind sometime earlier last year. So I have to read. Thank you, Bollywood press. You and all of us in this room, really, belong to the most vilified segments in Indian society right now. Think about it. Bollywood, foreigners, and the press. But who are we? And, you know, what is Bollywood anyway? It’s just a bunch of people from other places. I was born and raised in New Delhi. My co-star Mahira Khan was born in Pakistan. Sunny Leone like all the nicest people was born in Canada. Alia Bhatt is British. Deepika Padukone was born in Denmark. Where are their birth certificates? And the beautiful Katrina Kaif was born in Hong Kong, raised in China, Japan, France, Switzerland, Poland, Belgium, Hawaii and then London. Bollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. If you kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but cricket and Arnab Goswami (he makes his debut on Republic Day) which are not arts. An actor’s only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like. And there were many, many, many powerful performances last year that did exactly that, breathtaking, passionate work. But there was one performance last year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person not sitting in the most respected seat in our state intimated someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modelled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. This brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That’s why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Bollywood Press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the committee to protect journalists. Because we’re going to need them going forward. And they’ll need us to safeguard the truth. And to quote Meryl Streep’s dear departed Princess Leia, ‘take your broken heart, make it into art. Thank you.”"

As Vicky Kaushal and Yami Gautam’s Uri: The Surgical Strike is dominating box-office numbers and getting a thumbs up from the audience, one dialogue from the film has captured hearts of people in the virtual and real world alike. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Manohar Parrikar, all have used the film’s line — ‘How’s the Josh?’ and got a thundering response of ‘High Sir!’ emulating the patriotic zeal of the Aditya Dhar’s directorial debut.
Now, the hit dialogue which has also got a meme treatment from Twitter users as well as the police forces in the country, Amul featured the dialogue in its latest cartoon. Tweaking the line, the topical features a caricature of Vicky Kaushal with an automatic rifle in one hand and butter toast in another. With a tagline of “Makhan ka Josh”, the dairy brand asked its lovers to “raid the fridge”.

Kaushal, who plays the lead role in the movie, retweeted the cartoon and others too loved its pictorial tribute. While some came up with an innovative version of ‘High Sir’, others used other dialogues of the movie in their replies. A few altered it a little to make it even better.
Aditya Dhar, the film’s director, thanked the brand and called it an “honour” to be featured in their latest topical.

Opposition NC in Jammu and Kashmir today accused Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti of “complete surrender” in order to remain in office at all costs, saying she is being merely summoned at security review meetings to play a “supporting role” to Governor N N Vohra.
“The appalling fact that the Chief Minister is summoned to merely attend security review meetings is an indication of how Mehbooba has surrendered the mandate and sanctity of the Chief Minister’s chair in order to remain in office at all costs,” NC provincial president, Kashmir, Nasir Aslam Wani said in Srinagar.
Wani said it is an established precedent and security protocol that the Chief Minister as the head of the Unified Headquarter (UHQ) calls the security review meetings and heads them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“But now, she is invited as a mere participant to such meetings at the Raj Bhawan if not just as an observer. This does not bode well for the institutions of democracy in the state,” he said.

The NC leader said “the new trend” of security review meetings being chaired in the Raj Bhawan in the presence of the Governor is against the spirit of accountable governance in the state.
“If New Delhi doesn’t trust Mehbooba, they should stop this facade and do something about it. Having security review meetings in the Raj Bhawan belittles the democratic process and the very essence of a Government’s representative character,” he said.
“The Chief Minister has been elected to play an active role in security matters of the state and this mandate and authority cannot be shifted to anyone else,” he said, alleging Mehbooba’s “surrender is total and complete”.
Wani alleged that in addition to the security review meetings at the Raj Bhawan, it is the Governor who is calling meetings with ministers to inquire about core policy measures and the ministers in turn were briefing the Governor instead of the Chief Minister.
“It is high time Mehbooba either steps up to the challenges and responsibilities that come with power or at least demonstrates the humility to admit she is not up to the task. Her incompetence, ineptness and lack of leadership threatens to discredit democratic institutions beyond retrievable limits and this is an enormous risk for a state like Jammu and Kashmir,” NC provincial president Kashmir said."

(Source: File)
Art, declared political and artistic voices recently amidst the din over banning Pakistani artists from Indian films, should be above politics. But nothing could be more impossible for art is dipped deeply in politics. Every stroke of a brush, every word from a pen, how a girl says yes or no in a film, is tangibly touched by the politics of its time. Colonial politics fuelled Bankim Chandra and Rabindranath Tagore’s art, daring to imagine a land where Indians could hold their head high. The politics of independent India, its black market, its poverty, its passion for dignity, informed the ‘‘angry young man” embodied by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1970s. And since liberalisation, global to local politics shape Indian art, from Karan Johar’s shiny movies to gritty outpourings like Dalit rap. To imagine art is above politics isn’t imagining art — it’s imagining a plastic product, bereft of the passions, the ideas, the violence and dreams of our times.
Similarly, imagining artists need not have a political stand is belittling artists. An artist isn’t a pretty party performer. An artist should entertain, of course — and no one appreciates Pakistani artist Fawad Khan’s mind-blowing stubble more than I. But an artist is more than a mimic. An artist represents freedom — the universal, unalienable idea that humanity must be free to live without fear, violence and misery. In this context, the desire to see Pakistani artists, appreciated in India, condemn the Uri attack, isn’t unreasonable. It’s logical for Uri was a cowardly and brutish assault upon those who had no opportunity to defend themselves. Any artist would want to throw in their colours, their songs with those who fight such darkness — and against those who want to crush the joy, the energy, all that jazz of the free world.
History shows the opprobrium earned by artists who differentiate between human lives. Richard Wagner was a great

composer. But his association with Germany’s Nazi ideology shrank his stature, making ithttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
hard for many who love Wagner’s Ring to not think, when it plays, of the millions herded into Holocaust camps, far

from wine, cheese, sonatas and philosophies. Some artists have lived within inhuman states, challenging them courageously. Through South Africa’s Apartheid, Nadine Gordimer shed light on darkness with heart-breaking, heart-warming words, even as the civilised world refused to play ball with a system that believed skin colour should determine a human’s life.
Terrorism also affronts people everywhere and all artists saying so makes sense. Previously, Pakistani artists condemned terror attacks in Peshawar and Paris. Their silence on terror hurting India thereby looks stark — and draws attention to their being Pakistani, rather than artists, which is a loss. Once, Faiz challenged the authorities of Pakistan, his irony leading him to the iron doors of Karachi jail. But that was an artist’s work — creating courage against violence by composing beautiful words and living them. By condemning terror in India, Fawad Khan and company could emphasise they’re not just Pakistan’s beautiful people, sprinking shers and sherwanis on routes perfumed with attar — and dynamite.
Yet, arguing art is above politics presents theorists with the opportunity to support lifting The Satanic Verses ban. In 1988, on this day, Salman Rushdie’s book was banned from import in India, a Congress government flirting with Muslim and Hindu right-wings, pulling Ayodhya, pushing Shah Bano into a cynical conjurer’s hat. But its Rushdie ban stamped hard on further art, M.F. Husain then hounded for drawing Hindu goddesses, Rohinton Mistry for discussing the Shiv Sena. Today, if art’s suddenly above politics, those arguing this should demand The Satanic Verses be free in India, to provoke and outrage, awe or bore, do what art does — help us develop the ability to say, “I hate this”, but not with a bomb.
The point of art is to shake, even break your heart and patch it up again, through paintings, words and chords that celebrate your life — and your right to live it, no matter who you are. Any art that doesn’t stand for that is just a thumka in the annals of time.

As India looks for non-military actions against Pakistan to avenge the killing of Indian soldiers in Uri, TV channels of the neighbouring country are focused on how to counter Indian forces in case it goes for a surgical strike. However, most of the debates and news packages being run on the TV channels seem to be full of wrong facts, questionable arguments and laughable content.
From Balochistan to the killing of Burhan Wani and the unrest in Kashmir, all are being discussed, while criticising Indian government and armed forces. One channel almost claimed Pakistan’s success during the Kargil war, saying, in case India thinks of attacking Pakistan they will meet the same fate.
Here are some clippings from the Pakistani TV news coverage after the Uri attack that makes one wonder what kind of news they’re broadcasting out there.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Indian Army Chief Dalbir Singh Afraid Of Pakistan: The anchor in this video is seen quoting chief of Pakistan Army as telling India “Bahut Maar padegi agar Pakistan pe humla karney ka socho to” (Will be beaten up badly in case you think of attacking us). May be she had forgotten what happened in 1965 and 1971.

 
Yaad Karo Kargil Ko: This Urdu news channel got its history wrong in this news package, which says India must recollect the memory of Kargil war before thinking to strike Pakistan. It says Pakistan destroyed India’s aircraft when it crossed the LoC and it will do the same in case Indian forces decides to go for a war with Pakistan. Well, we all know how Indian troops threw back Pakistani infiltrators from Indian soil.

 
Nawaz Shairf’s failure at the UN: The panellists here are attacking Pakistani parliamentarians for not being able to resolve the Kashmir issue. They want several committees to visit countries across the globe with classified documents about Indian atrocities and unmask India in front of the world. One of the panellists was even critical of Nawaz Sharif for being not fully prepared before his UN address. “He must have carried papers. Aap haath hilaatey jaatey hain to aapko seriously nahi liya jata.

 
Uri attack to divert attention from Kashmir unrest: According to 92 HD, the Uri attack happened at a time when Nawaz Sharif was going to raise Kashmir issue in UN. And by staging the Uri attack, India is apparently trying to divert the attention from Kashmir and link terrorism to Pakistan. Well, the global condemnation of Nawaz Sharif’s UN speech says it all.

Pakistani film Jago Hua Savera will not be screened at the Mumbai film festival anymore. The screening of the movie, which was slated to be shown in the restored classics section, attracted much criticism owing to the prevailing hostile sentiments towards Pakistan after the Uri attacks.

Trouble for the movie started when a NGO named Sangharsh Foundation wrote to the Mumbai Police seeking permission to protest against the screening of the film. MAMI decided to scrap the screening and wrote in its official statement said, “Given the current situation, the Jio MAMI 18th Mumbai Film Festival with Star has decided not to programme Jago Hua Savera as part of the Restored Classics Section.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The said Pakistani film was Pakistan’s official entry to the 1960 Oscars and was made in East Pakistan, which is now a part of Bangladesh. The movie tells the tale of village fishermen and their dreams of owning individual boats.
Interestingly, at the press conference of MAMI earlier this month when Kiran Rao was asked if any Pakistani film would be screened at the festival and in the event of it being so, if there would be any concerns keeping in mind the current political atmosphere, the producer answered in negative. “The short answer to it is no,” Kiran had said."

Hours after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif raised the issue of Kashmir and praised Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani who was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, India on Thursday hit back and called Pakistan a “terrorist state” which hosts the “Ivy League of terrorism” and carries out “war crimes” against Indians through its “long-standing policy of sponsoring terrorism”.

Later in the day, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup used a Hindi proverb to drive home the point that the Pakistani establishment was colluding with terrorists. Responding to a query on the absence of Pakistan’s intelligence chief at a SAARC meeting of intelligence chiefs in New Delhi, Swarup said “chor ki daadhi mein tinka” (having done something wrong and trying to hide it).
 
Exercising India’s right to reply after Sharif’s speech to the UN General Assembly, Eenam Gambhir, First Secretary at the Permanent Mission of India to the UN, said, “The land of Taxila, one of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, is now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts aspirants and apprentices from all over the world.”
“The effect of its toxic curriculum are felt across the globe,” she said, adding it was ironical that a country which had established itself as the global epicentre of terrorism was preaching human rights and talking about ostensible support for self-determination. Gambhir said shortly before Pakistan gave its “hypocritical sermons” at the world body, its envoy in New Delhi was summoned over the most recent of the terror attacks, the one at Uri that claimed 18 Indian lives. “That terrorist attack is part of a trail of continuous flow of terrorists trained and armed by our neighbour and tasked to carry out terrorist attacks in my country,” she said.

“When practised as an instrument of state policy, it is a war crime. What my country and our other neighbours are facing today is Pakistan’s long-standing policy of sponsoring terrorism, the consequences of which have spread well beyond our region,” she said. India sees in Pakistan “a terrorist state” that channelises billions of dollars, much of it diverted from international aid, to training, financing and supporting terrorist groups as militant proxies against it neighbours.
In a clear reference to Jaish-e-Muhammad chief Masood Azhar and Mumbai terror attack mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Gambhir said terrorist entities and their leaders, including many designated by the UN, continue to roam the streets of Pakistan freely and operate with state support.

“With the approval of the authorities, many terrorist organisations raise funds openly in flagrant violation of Pakistan’s international obligations,” she said. While Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation record is marked by “deception and deceit,” it talks about restraint, renunciation and peace. “Similar false promises it has made to us — the international community — on terrorism. Perhaps renunciation of lies and self-restraint on threats could be a good place for Pakistan to start,” Gambhir said.
Criticising Sharif for glorifying Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani, she said, “Even today, we have heard support from the Prime Minister of Pakistan for a self-acknowledged commander of a known terrorist organisation.” She said Pakistan was a democracy-deficit country and practised terrorism on its own people.

“It extends support to extremist groups, suppresses minorities and women and denies basic human rights, including through draconian laws,” she said. She voiced India’s firm resolve to protect all its citizens from all acts of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. “We cannot and will not allow terrorism to prevail,” she said.
Later in the day, Swarup also hinted at the Indus Waters Treaty — as there is a growing demand for it to be reviewed and used as a lever against Pakistan — “for any such treaty to work, you need mutual trust and goodwill. I will leave it at that.” He said that over the past two days, about 50 countries have spoken at the UNGA, but nobody had raised the issue of Kashmir — 80 per cent of Sharif’s speech was on that issue. He also praised UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon’s “wise” words that India and Pakistan should resolve the dispute “bilaterally”.
Asked about diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan, he said demarches — like the one made on Wednesday to Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit — can be made only if there are diplomatic relations. He was responding to a question on demands from certain quarters for snapping diplomatic ties.
Swarup said India does not need to prepare any dossier since the world knows about the deeds of Pakistan on terrorism. He said Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar had shown Basit photographs of grenades with Pakistan markings and GPS devices, which he called “irrefutable evidence”. He reiterated India’s request for checking the fingerprints and DNA samples of terrorists in Uri attack with their own national database to establish their identity. “We await a response from Pakistan,” he said. He declined to comment on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Islamabad for the SAARC summit in November. “Every question cannot be answered in yes or no,” he said."

RJD chief Lalu Prasad today condemned the terror attack on the Army camp in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir in which at least 17 jawans were killed and 20 injured and held Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “negligence” responsible for the turn of events.
“Our soldiers are being killed because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s negligence. Jammu and Kashmir is the integral part of our country which is gradually slipping out of control,” Prasad alleged. BJP reacted sharply to Prasad’s comments and suggested him not to politicise such tragic incident.

“It (the terror attack) is a very tragic and sad incident. There are people from Bihar among those who were killed in the attack. The Prime Minister has taken the incident as a challenge and said that he will take revenge,” Leader of Opposition in Bihar’s Upper House Sushil Modi said.
“Don’t politicise it and make statements as the issue concerns our nation’s identity and security,” he appealed to Prasad."

“We have finalised the SAARC training plan, and Pakistan will be invited. But it is up to Islamabad to decide whether it wants to send their representative or not,” said a senior MHA official. North Block officials also said the stand-off over Jadhav may lead to souring of ties in other fields, including cooperation in SAARC matters.
The SAARC Disaster Management Centre (SDMC), which was being run from Delhi since last year, was shifted to Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management (GIDM) in January after Pakistan said it has ‘no objection’ to moving the institute to Gujarat. Other SAARC nations, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka had already given their nod, officials said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Retired IAS officer P K Mishra, currently Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, was earlier the director of GIDM. Government sources told The Indian Express that the Ministry of External Affairs recently cleared a grant of Rs 47 lakh for SDMC and informed the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday. Incidentally, Pakistan military court handed over death sentence to 46-year-old Jadhav on the same day.
According to the Home Ministry’s proposal, GIDM will hold a module on ‘application of space technology and managing risks’ and ‘programme on short-range regional early warning system’.
While the lecture on space technology will be a three-day programme, the seminar on early warning will have experts and special invitees from SAARC countries and will be a two-week residential event that will host nearly two dozen participants.
Officials said Islamabad too was keen on having the SAARC Disaster Management Centre but a compromise was worked out during a SAARC meet last year where the Council agreed to set up SDMC in India and proposed to expand an existing centre in Pakistan that will look after the environmental issues.
Pakistan had faced embarrassment in November after India and other nations boycotted the SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad forcing the host country to cancel the event. India was the first to announce that it will not participate in the meet in wake of the Uri attack."

Blaming Pakistan for having uneasy relationship with India, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said it is for Islamabad to introspect as to why there are tensions between the two neighbours. “It is a serious situation. Right from the day this government had been formed and even prior to that, India has taken one step after another honestly trying to improve relations with Pakistan,” he said at HT Leadership Summit here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a lot of initiatives including unconventional ones but then the response was Pathankot or Uri attack, prompted by Pakistan, he said.

“This cannot be normal as far as Indo-Pak relationships are concerned. If there are tensions, its for the Pakistan to introspect really why there are tensions,” he said.
Asked about impact of change in regime in the US, Jaitley said the relationship between the two country is expected to strengthen further.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I have not the least doubt that India’s relations with the United States would continue to be on the same plank as it was, probably growing and maturing almost by the day,” he said.
“This was unusual election as far as the US was concerned. When one world’s most powerful democracies through a fair electoral process takes a decision, we have to accept the decision,” he added."

Ever since 19 Indian soldiers lost their lives in the dastardly Uri attacks, the nation has remained on a boil. Adding fuel to fire is the multiple newsroom debates where Indians are arguing amongst themselves. And to make matters worse, there is the political call to ban Pakistani actors.
Evidently angry at the turn of events in India post the attacks, an angry Akshay Kumar spoke his mind through a video message posted on his Facebook account.
Read: Nana Patekar says jawans are our real heroes, actors are trivialhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Said Akshay, “I am not talking to you as a star or celebrity. I am talking to as an army man’s son. I have been noticing since long that in news and newspapers our own countrymen are arguing with each other. Some are asking for surgical strikes proof. Some are demanding that artists be banned. Some are scared of whether a war will happen or not. Gentlemen, please argue later. First please think about those who have laid down their lives for you at the border. 19 jawans attained martyrdom in Uri attacks. One 24 -year-old soldier Nitin Kumar sacrificed his life in Baramulla. Are their families and every other army family concerned about whether a film will release or not or will an artist be banned or not? They have just one worry, just one concern- their future. We should be see to it that their present and future should be correct and secured. They are there guarding us and that is why I and you are alive today. If they are not there to guard us, Hindustan will not be left. Jai Hind.”

FOR THE two Mumbai families whose sons have been arrested by Pakistan authorities on charges of espionage, the surgical strike by India along the Line of Control ( LoC) has led to fears that bringing them back will become more difficult.
Hamid Ansari, a youth from Versova, was arrested in November 2012 by Pakistani authorities for spying. In August this year, he finally managed to get consular access. For his mother Fauzia Ansari, who has been fighting tooth-and-nail for her son’s release, just when things were looking bright, the unrest in Kashmir, the Uri attack and now the surgical strike by Indian Army has come as a setback. “We were very happy that my son finally managed to get consular access. But now, with such a tense atmosphere between the two countries, we don’t see our case moving forward,” Fauzia told The Sunday Express.

“I have not spoken to my son for the past four years. I am dying to hear his voice. After consular access was granted, I was hopeful that through the lawyer, we would be able to communicate with each other. But now that channel seems blocked,” Fauzia said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A teacher by profession, Fauzia said that it was through her counsel that she could ask her son about the news of attacks on him in the Pakistan prison. “In the past six months, he had been attacked twice. On one occasion, somebody abused and roughed him up for ‘being an Indian whose country is responsible for the unrest in Kashmir’. I enquired about this through a lawyer and they confirmed to me that he was indeed attacked twice,” Fauzia said. “I am so helpless. I cannot do anything to ensure that my son at least gets a chance to prove his innocence.”
Hamid Ansari, then 27, left home on November 5, 2012, claiming that he was headed to Afghanistan in search of a job. But his family later came to know from officials and associates that he was in love with a woman from the Kohat region of western Pakistan, and had decided to cross over to prevent her marriage with another man.
According to Mumbai Police, Ansari was allegedly convinced by friends and contacts in Pakistan that he could enter the country easily from Afghanistan. Indian high commission officials in Pakistan believe he had been arrested by local officials for entering the country illegally. He is currently serving a jail-term of 3.5 years in Pakistan on charges of being a spy.
While the Ansari household is holding on to the hope that consular access is a step in the right direction, for the family of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the increased hostility between the two countries has come as a major worry. Jadhav was arrested in March this year for being a Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) agent engaged in arming and financing Baloch insurgents.
“After the arrest, we were hoping that the government would initiate some negotiation with Pakistan to get back our son. But in the present situation, we don’t see that happening anytime soon. Jadhav has been booked on a very serious charge of espionage but with no consular access, how will we ever be able to prove that he is just a businessman who was carrying on his trade?” said a family member on the condition of anonymity.
In June, Pakistan had denied India’s request to provide Jadhav consular access. “Since he is a foreign national, it is Pakistan’s responsibility to share details concerning the arrested person and also allow him to avail the service of a lawyer. But that has not happened so far. It is a settled international law that family members of an accused have to be intimated about the arrest and the accused be provided counsel,” a family source said.
Fauzia, meanwhile, has turned to Twitter in her quest to get back her son. She has started #HelpHamid trends on Twitter, and spends every Sunday tweeting over 200 messages so that the authorities take note of it.
“I have learnt that Twitter is a very powerful medium to get noticed and therefore, I have taken my campaign to the social media platform. Since I am busy through the week, I spend my Sundays sending out over 200 tweets so that hashtag #HelpHamid trends and people ask the authorities on both the sides to help me,” Fauzia said."

(PTI Photo)
ATTACKING PRIME Minister Narendra Modi over the Centre’s “failure” to prevent terrorist attacks, BSP chief Mayawati Sunday said that the PM’s advice to the Pakistani government to focus on the welfare of its citizens is a good thing, but he should look into his own backyard to see whether his record is such that he can preach.
Watch What Else is Making News


“Is it so that one who is eating jaggery is suggesting others to avoid it?” Mayawati asked, reacting to the PM’s first remarks on the Uri terror attack at BJP’s national executive meet in Kozhikode on Saturday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Addressing mediapersons, the BSP chief said that the advice was an attempt at “emotional blackmail”, and an attempt to divert people’s attention from Modi’s failures before the upcoming elections in UP and other states.
Mayawati said people are “enraged” over the killing of 18 soldiers in Uri, and expect “concrete assurances” and “effective action” from the government to prevent any recurrences. She, however, added that people are only getting “despondency” from the actions of the PM, who did not assure them that the borders would now be secure, and terrorists would not infiltrate.
Mayawati claimed the government appears to be “misleading people” instead of making a long-term policy with consensus and implementing it. “It is surprising that the talk of war against poverty, unemployment and illiteracy in Pakistan is being made to divert people’s attention from its (government’s) failures to stop the loss of lives and property in the terrorist attacks from across the border,” she said.
The BSP chief added that the Modi government’s record on poverty, inflation, illiteracy and unemployment has also been “very bad”, and that BJP had faced defeat in Delhi, Bihar, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu because it did not fulfill promises made during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
She claimed it is alarming that “this government will prove to be a failure like the Congress government” in securing the country’s borders and ensuring the well-being of soldiers, and that it will not be able to stop terrorist incidents along the borders.
Mayawati said Modi would suffer losses in the upcoming elections in various states because of his failures in public welfare and social security, so he has “cunningly tried to mislead people by linking India’s burning problems with Pakistan’s”. “It was not a big achievement but a political attempt to emotionally blackmail the people to affect the elections,” she added.
Targeting the ruling SP, Mayawati said people are suffering in “the internal rift and civil war of SP’s first family, caused by Mulayam Singh Yadav’s love for his son”. She added that law and order and developmental works are in a bad shape, while services in sectors such as health have come to a halt.
“The SP government seems to be playing fiddle like Nero while people are suffering from dengue and chikungunya… Governor Ram Naik and the Centre should direct the state government’s attention to its failures, so that people in distress can get some relief,” she said."

Nazia Amin Mohammad, a Pakistani national, has now come under the media spotlight after her attempt to pay tribute to her Malayalee friends has gone viral. She recently made a video in which she has sung a hit melody number ‘Malare’ from blockbuster Malayalam film, Premam, which is now being lapped up by Malayalees in India and other parts of the world.`
“Since I have met so many friends from Kerala, India and Dubai, it’s my wish to dedicate a Malayali song for you people,” Nazia’s says in the video before she begins to sing. She also apologised beforehand for any probable pronunciation errors she might make during the course of the song.
Nazia begins on a strong note and only gets better as she progress. However, she stumbles with the Malayalam lyrics a little and laugh at her own mistake, even as she continues to finish the first stanza of the song.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Despite some missteps, which are largely negligible, Nazia, who hails from Karachi, has nailed the song. She has sung the song so beautifully and with so much of innocence, no wonder her video has gone viral on the social media and receiving a lot of attention from the media outlets too.
The video of Nazia, a business development executive, based in Dubai, was first shared by her friend on Facebook and is now going viral.
	
	
		
			
At the time when India was in the midst of debating the aspects of artistic freedom, where the patriotism of filmmakers is being questioned based on their casting choices, Nazia is relishing her friendship with the Indians.
Just days ago, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar had been in the eye of the storm for casting Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which was released on Friday. The director had to go the extra mile to pacify Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, which had issued a ban on the release of the film. The right wing groups have sought a ban on Pakistan artists working in Indian entertainment space in the light of the deadly Uri attack that killed 18 Indian soldiers, taking the India-Pakistan relations to a new low.`"

In an apparent response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that India and Pakistan should battle to eradicate poverty, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told a joint session of his country’s parliament that “if they want us to fight them to end poverty, then they should realise that poverty cannot be ended by driving tanks on farmlands”, the Dawn website reported Wednesday.
“We have done everything to make India come to the dialogue table, but India did not let it happen. Our efforts were thwarted over and over again. I would like to repeat our stance that we are against war. We want peace in the region. We want to resolve all outstanding disputes through dialogue,” Sharif was quoted as telling lawmakers.

On India’s allegation of Pakistan’s involvement in the Uri attack, he said: “Without any investigation, within a few hours, India blamed Pakistan for the attack. Through this, one can see what India’s motives are.”
Referring to India’s announcement of surgical strikes against terror launch pads along the Line of Control, Sharif said “India’s ceasefire violation resulted in the death of our two soldiers. It was befittingly responded and was conveyed that Pakistan Army is fully capable to respond to any aggression.”
The joint session, called to discuss “Indian aggression” on the Line of Control (LoC) and foreign policy matters after India pledged to “isolate Pakistan”, was also told by the Pakistan Prime Minister that “world powers need to ensure that UN resolutions on Kashmir should be implemented in letter and spirit”.
Opposition leader Khursheed Shah of PPP was quoted by Dawn as saying: “Why is our foreign policy so weak, why are we lonely? We have to realise our mistakes and choose a better path for the future. Our policies have led to this stage, where Bangladesh is also against us.”
On the boycott of the SAARC summit in Islamabad, Shah said: “They (India) have tried to isolate us diplomatically. The SAARC conference is before you. Five countries refused to attend it. We should have pre-empted such developments.”"

The NIA registered a fresh case in New Delhi in connection with the attack a day after the Union Home Ministry directed the agency to probe the attack. The J&K Police had earlier registered a case after terrorists stormed the camp on the directions of their foreign handlers.
Officials said that an NIA team would reach Jammu shortly to visit the attack scene. They added that the NIA would submit the FIR in the case before a Special Court in Jammu. The police’s CID wing would hand over material evidence collected so far to the NIA."

SRK’s leading lady in the upcoming movie Raees, Mahira all set for her big Bollywood debut on January 25. But what could’ve been her dream debut, turned sour due to the political turmoil between the two nations last year. Mahira has been barred from promoting Raees in India and with her team.
Mahira is already a popular name in India, thanks to her hit Pakistani shows like Humsafar which aired on Zindagi channel. And while Mahira has kept the buzz around Raees on her social media accounts, by sharing regular posts and tweets, she still yearns to be with her cast at this time.
Mahira spoke in length about her Bollywood film in a candid interview with Pakistani publication Dawn.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Mahira has expressed disappointment that Raees is not releasing in Pakistan. In the interview she said, “I want my country to see this. I want everybody to see it, every person in the world. My friends keep saying you did it, it’s enough, you can just keep it in a box somewhere… I do that, but there’s a part of me that says, no, I want everybody to see my blood sweat and tears for these two years, because it’s been tough and I want people to see it even if I fail at it. But if it’s one thing I’ve learnt over these two years it’s that there are somethings beyond one’s control. I mean you can save a scene, you can fix things later in film but there are somethings that are out of your reach. You just can’t do anything. But I’m dying for it to come here.”

Mahira, including other Pakistani actors like Fawad Khan and Ali zafar faced the heat last year after the unfortunate Uri attack. The tensions between both the countries became so intense, that all Pakistani artistes were banned from working in Indian film industry, and even had to leave all their future projects in India mid-way. Mahira said, “It was painful”.
“With this ban, it’s unfortunate. Six months ago, I was getting a new script every day. Cut to six months later and producers are saying there’s no scope, let’s go back to dramas.”

Mahira confessed of even shedding tears for not being able to experience all the high around the promotions of Raees in India and elsewhere. “I was coming here and the new song is out. Everyone was sending messages and I had tears rolling down in the car. Again. For the tenth time! And my hairstylist sent me a message saying ‘I think we should always say goodbye with tears because we always meet again when we do that.’ I don’t want to romanticize things but by the end of the two years we had people crying saying goodbye. And I am so indebted to all of them, especially my director Rahul Dholakia and the producer Ritesh Sidhwani, who have stood by me all through these two years, even at the worst of times.”

On working with Shah Rukh Khan, Mahira said, “He is magic really, honestly. He spoilt me for life. He used to tell me to do things this way, do it that way. At one point I asked him, am I not doing it right? He said ‘Look I am only telling you what I know, from my experience. You do it your way but all I want is when you see yourself on screen you don’t come to me and say, why didn’t you tell me!’ Other than that, he’s so bloody smart. There’s nothing you can’t talk to him about.”
“We’ve had amazing conversations. It’s so much fun to talk to someone who’s intelligent. It’s not just about films, he can talk about anything! Of course I’ve always been a fan. But if you watch his interviews, you can tell he’s witty, smart. It was a pleasure working with someone you can have a conversation with.”

While expectedly innocuous in its wording — and the product of intense back-channel negotiations — the decision to give peace with Pakistan a fresh chance clearly has the personal imprimatur of Prime Minister Narendra Modi stamped on it.
Even contrarians will admit that not since Indira Gandhi has an Indian Prime Minister had the political authority or the diplomatic flexibility to offer a new regional framework to Pakistan and the rest of the neighbourhood: A genuine chance at building a “security community” in South Asia. A security community is defined as one where the states of the region have agreed, at the very least, not to use violence to settle any of their bilateral conflicts.
The alternative for the neighbourhood is to live with the consequences of a hostile India that will continue to escalate the costs of non-cooperation. Indeed, it is the nimbleness with which New Delhi is able to switch from “carrots” to “sticks” and vice versa that has become the hallmark of the Modi foreign policy doctrine.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Consider this: A Modi who has the chutzpah to arrive at Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s grand-daughter’s wedding at Sharif ‘s Raiwind residence outside Lahore in 2015, on his way back from Kabul, is also someone who ordered surgical strikes against terrorist camps across the LoC in 2016 following the terrorist attacks at Uri. Later, in 2019, the PM also approved the airstrikes against the JEM in Balakot in POK as a response to the Jaish’s Fedayeen attack at Pulwama and he declared, “Hamara siddhant hai, hum ghar mein ghus ke marenge (it is our principle to take the attack to the adversary’s home)”.
Editorial |Decision to recommit to 2003 ceasefire opens possibilities that must be carefully built upon, not lost, by both countries
Be that as it may, the DGMO statement is an important confidence-building measure in itself, since the number of reported violations of the cease-fire across the Line of Control had dramatically increased in the last year. The collateral damage as a consequence of firing impacts particularly the most vulnerable sections of the communities living close to the LoC and other sectors, and they will be the immediate beneficiaries if the statement is implemented in letter and spirit. But, hopefully, this move is also the first step towards a gradual normalisation of diplomatic relations, which had gone into a tailspin after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019.
It would be shortsighted for cynics to view New Delhi’s commitment to cease fire as driven by pressure from the new Biden administration in the US — as street gossip would have it. From New Delhi’s perspective, peace on the border and better relations with Pakistan are rooted in the strategic logic of a country that is mostly satisfied with the status quo and wants a stable neighbourhood. And, in the past in the early 1990s, if pressure from the Clinton administration with a hostile Robin Raphel (as its point person for South Asia) could not move a much weaker India under PV Narasimha Rao to concede ground on Kashmir, it is unlikely to happen in Modi’s India.
But unlike other recent governments, the Modi regime could turn belligerently revanchist if its benign acceptance of the status quo is viewed as a weakness by Islamabad or the GHQ in Rawalpindi. For the Modi government, therefore, a calm summer in Jammu and Kashmir (without attempts at disruption by Islamabad) would be one test of Pakistan’s strategic commitment to rebuilding bilateral relations. There are early signs that the leadership in Pakistan, which includes the army, is beginning to see the futility of a confrontationist course with India, and it is in New Delhi’s interest to strengthen these tendencies by offering incentives that include the promise of a robust engagement.
If bilateral relations were to return to even keel, we could witness a SAARC summit in Islamabad later this year (not held since 2016 as a consequence of the Uri attacks). It is here that Prime Minister Modi could unveil his vision for South Asia. Even contrarians will admit that India’s neighbourhood policy, a cause for despair even a few weeks ago, has acquired a new alacrity and generated a sense of hope that Neighbourhood First will not remain an empty slogan. A curtain-raiser of the blueprint is in the vaccine maitri initiative (to make the anti-COVID-19 vaccine freely available to even the most marginal groups in the neighbourhood) that has become the most potent instrument of India’s soft power across the region. Similarly, a possible Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement that could be signed during Modi’s visit to Bangladesh next month, could become a template for the whole region. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s speech in Colombo recently suggests that the constituency in Pakistan for such an approach may be larger than most imagined.

But the two pillars of connectivity and collaboration rest on the basic commitment to building a security community which owes its conceptual origins to the German political scientist Karl Deutsch. An explicit commitment by Islamabad to not use violence (especially through non-state actors) as an instrument of its statecraft would be essential for the advancement of this objective, and indeed, for constructing a peaceful, prosperous and purposeful South Asia.
Nearly 50 years ago, in July 1971, the American President Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, feigned a stomach upset in Islamabad, to travel secretly to Beijing to secure a new entente with China. Only a deeply conservative President Nixon (who had once called on the silent majority of Americans to seek national solidarity in the war against Vietnam) could make the opening to China. Nixon and the opening to China has since become a classic case study for students of foreign policy. Islamabad, too, could do well to learn from this history and realise that in today’s India only Narendra Modi can deliver on the promise of a sustainable detente with Pakistan.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, who led protests against the release of the film ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’, Saturday told reporters that every producer who has cast Pakistani artists in their films will give Rs 5 crore to the army relief fund. He also asked Bollywood producers ‘to give in writing’ that they would not take actors from Pakistan in their films, news agency ANI reported.
WHAT ELSE IS MAKING NEWS

“We have always protested against Pakistani artistes but Bollywood never understood earlier. Now they have realised. Terrorist attacks have always been happening. I told Mukesh Bhatt. Pakistan bans our films and channels as per whims and fancies. So why are we rolling the red carpet for Pakistani actors, ” said Thackeray.
“CM asked me about the solution. Karan Johar will display a slate of tribute for Uri martyrs before Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starts playing out on the screens. Producers guild should give us a written undertaking that no Pakistani actors will be cast in our films,” added Thackeray.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier today, after a meeting brokered by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Thackeray called off protests against the release of ADHM, scheduled to come out around Diwali. The MNS, and other nationalist groups, had kickstarted protests against the film, which stars Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, and threatened to burn down theatres which screened it. The protests erupted following the tensions between India and Pakistan, over the Uri attack that killed 19 soldiers and subsequently the army’s surgical strikes across the Line of Control.
The ADHM producers after the meeting today vowed not to work with Pakistani artists in future."

Using a two-pronged tactic in the Human Rights Council, Pakistan has raised the Kashmir issue while speaking on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and then for itself. In its reply during the debate on Wednesday at the UN in Geneva, India rejected the OIC statement saying the group had no standing in India’s internal affairs and accused Pakistan of using “terrorism as a state policy under the guise of concern for human rights.”
Islamabad also brought up Kulbhushan Jadhav, who is on death row in Pakistan accused of being an Indian intelligence agent, while replying to India’s counter-statement. Sumit Seth, a Counsellor in India’s Mission in Geneva, said that the world does not need lessons in democracy and human rights from a “failed state” that has a record of protecting terrorists like Osama Bin Laden, persecuting minorities with blasphemy laws and enforcing disappearances.
“As regards the references to India in the OIC statement of earlier today, we outrightly reject all those references,” he said. “The OIC has no locus standi on India’s internal affairs,” he said. A Second Secretary in Pakistan’s Geneva UN Mission, Qazi Saleem Ahmed Khan, speaking on behalf of the OIC, tried to link Kashmir to Palestine.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Speaking about a 17-year-old Palestinian girl, Ahed Tamimi, who is on trial before an Israeli military tribunal on charges of assaulting Israeli soldiers, he slipped in a reference to Insha Mushtaq, a 16-year-old Kashmiri girl who lost her eyesight when hit by pellets fired by security forces. In September, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, Maleeha Lodhi held up a picture of an injured Palestinian girl that had been published in The New York Times claiming she was Kashmiri.
Later during Wednesday’s debate, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative in Geneva, Faruk Amil, said he was concerned about what he called the drift of India towards a “political order marked by extremism and rank communalism”. He referred to the beef controversy in India and alleged that Muslims carrying beef were being lynched.
Seth, in his right of reply, said, “Various international organisations have repeatedly reported on how enforced disappearances continue with impunity in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh where people are routinely abducted and unlawfully killed.” “More than a million people remain displaced as a result of the current and past armed conflicts in the northwest of Pakistan,” he added.
“Women and girls, especially from minority communities, are abducted and forcibly married. The minorities are persecuted, including through notorious blasphemy laws,” he said. “Terrorism is the most fundamental violation of human rights. Pakistan has long been attempting to mask its territorial ambitions in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral and inseparable part of India, and use of terrorism as a state policy under the guise of concern for human rights,” Seth said.
“Pakistan has continued to support cross-border terrorism in India,” he said. “We await credible action by the government of Pakistan to bring all those involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack and the 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks to justice. Is it not woefully farcical that the state which protected Osama Bin Laden and sheltered (Taliban leader) Mullah Omar should make the pretence of being a victim,” he asked.
Adding that in gross violation of a Security Council resolution, UN-designated terrorists like Hafiz Mohammed Saeed were freely operating in Pakistan with government support, and the groups designated as terrorist “are being politically mainstreamed in Pakistan”. Replying to Seth, a Pakistani delegate accused India of promoting terrorism in his country and claimed that Jadhav’s arrest was proof of it. He was cut off by the chair for exceeding his time limit as he made a long attack on India."

The Lahore High Court has lifted the ban placed on Indian serials being aired in Pakistan by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority also known as PEMRA on Tuesday. Declaring the ban null and void, the government has shown no objections to Indian teleplays.
Last year, PEMRA had issued a ban on all Indian content in October as an aftermath of the Uri attack which spoiled relations between the two countries. According to reports in the Dawn, a company called M/s Leo Communications which is TV channel Filmazia’s parent organisation, had requested the lifting of the ban claiming that Pemra’s powers do not allow the imposing of a ban and neither does the Pakistani constitution.
The petition even claimed that this was an instance of “selective patriotism” by the government. What is surprising is the fact that Indian movies were being aired all over the country but were not allowed for television. Although the ban had already been lifted in February last year, the serials had not received necessary permission. “The world has become a global village,” LHC Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said, as reported by The Dawn.

He also questioned how long such unreasonable restrictions could exist. Though the PEMRA counsel made a point that the ban had only been imposed because India has also levied similar restrictions on Pakistani content, the judge maintained that only the Indian content with objectionable or anti-Pakistan content should be censored and was against the idea of a complete ban."

In the next three phases of Lok Sabha polls — the second being tomorrow — more than 20,000 security personnel will be on duty on polling day. ‘‘Ensuring foolproof security is proving to be a difficult task since most of the incidents have not involved hard-core militants. These have mainly been grenade attacks, probably involving locals, who may have been given money to carry them out,’’ disclosed a senior intelligence official.
Even today’s attack on PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti was along the same lines, where the grenade seemed to have been hurled from a local house. Sources said hard-core militants themselves appeared to be lying low with security personnel maintaining a strict vigil. ‘‘But to prevent these kinds of grenade attacks, the local intelligence, too, has to be very strong,’’ the official added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said the government was keen to maintain the more-than-modest level of voter turnout for the remaining three phases of elections. ‘‘In the first phase, the voter turnout was reasonably good even in terrorist-infested areas like Uri (58 per cent), Karna (41 per cent), Kupwara (35 per cent), Lolab (46 per cent), Handwara (39 per cent), Gurez (55 per cent), Bandipora (38 per cent) and Pulwama (25 per cent),’’ an official said.
The turnout, so far, had been much better than in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls but worse than the 2002 Assembly polls. ‘‘That is understandable. Then the people were electing their own state government. The level of enthusiasm is bound to be higher. But even this time, the attendance at political rallies and meetings has been quite high,’’ he added. So the government wanted to maintain the good voter turnout.
With talks with the Hurriyat Conference on, and Kashmir being the focus of international attention, the government was keen to foil terrorist attempts to disrupt polls and conduct smooth elections in the state.
There have been 25 incidents of poll-related violence so far, with 17 killed. These included attacks on political rallies, candidates during campaigning, explosions at the PDP rally in Uri, attack on Congress rally in Banihal, two attempts on the life of Farooq Abdullah, one on Omar Abdullah, on CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed besides attack on Congress headquarters in Srinagar, and today’s attack on Mehbooba."

PM Narendra Modi on Thursday presided over a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting on the prevailing tense situation along the Line of Control (LoC). Rajnath Singh, Ajit Doval, Arun Jaitley, S Jaishankar, Manohar Parrikar, Army Chief Dalbir Singh and other senior officials were present at the meeting.
This meeting is significant as the government has launched a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan after the Uri attack, in which 18 soldiers were killed by Jaish-e-Muhammad terrorists. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for the dastardly attack.

Last week, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju had told reporters that any response to the Uri attack would be taken by the government after due consideration. “Action will be taken after due consideration. Action is not taken after making announcements,” he had said. “It is a very serious issue… The matter cannot be handled just like that,” Rijiju added."

NINE MONTHS after Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), the country’s powerful media watchdog, clamped down on airing of Indian television serials in the aftermath of the Uri attack last September and the subsequent surgical strikes by India, the Lahore High Court lifted the ban on Tuesday.
The court, according to a report on news site Dawn, declared the ban as “null and void” since the Pakistan government had no objection to the screening of these tele-serials. According to the report, Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that Indian content with objectionable or anti-Pakistan content can be censored but there is no need for a complete ban. “The world has become a global village,” Justice Shah said, and asked how long unreasonable restrictions will be imposed. PEMRA had issued a notification imposing a ban on all Indian content on October 19, 2016, as relations between Pakistan and India soured.
Leo Communications, TV channel Filmazia’s parent organisation, had moved court, seeking to overturn the ban as it had not been imposed by the government. It challenged PEMRA’s circular as being “beyond the powers of the regulatory body and the Constitution”. The petitioner’s counsel, Asma Jehangir, one of Pakistan’s top human rights lawyers and an advocate of the dialogue process between the neighbours, argued in court that a ban on Indian teleplays appeared “bizarre” when Indian films were openly screened across the country.
The ban on screening Indian films was lifted in February. PEMRA’s counsel claimed that the ban had been imposed since India had imposed similar restrictions on all Pakistani content. But Chief Justice Shah asked why was PEMRA making airing of Indian content an issue when the Pakistan government had no objections."

Briefing the media after Modi’s meeting with the two leaders, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that the Prime Minister thanked them for the solidarity shown by Sri Lanka and Bhutan after the Uri terror attack. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena asserted that the country shares the grief of India over the Uri attack and his country stands firmly against terror in all its manifestations. “Terror is the direct threat to economic prosperity. We all want peace in the region and terrorism poses a direct challenge to this objective,” Sirisena told Modi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Bhutan PM Tshering Tobgay said cross-border terrorism is the worst form of terror. “We are deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the region,” he said. He also expressed his concern over the Uri attack and said Bhutan stands “shoulder to shoulder” with India. India has recently pushed the issue of cross-border terror at various international platforms in a bid to isolate Pakistan. All the countries in the region have shown support to India’s cause."

Parliament was paralysed on Thursday over demonetisation, with Rajya Sabha witnessing a sharp clash over certain remarks by Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, leaving a debate on the issue incomplete in the House which had a lively discussion on Wednesday.
Watch What Else Is making News

Opposition parties, led by Congress, created uproar in both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha as soon as the Houses met for the day and it continued throughout. The Lok Sabha could carry out business only during the Question Hour, that too amid the uproar, after which it was adjourned for the day minutes past 12 pm.
The Rajya Sabha could not transact any business. In the Upper House, which witnessed about six-hour-long debate on demonetisation yesterday, Congress and some other opposition parties pressed, from the word go, for the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the House and a response from him over the hardships caused to people by the November 8 decision to make Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes invalid.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
AIADMK members, meanwhile, trooped into the Well and created uproar demanding that Karnataka release Cauvery river water to Tamil Nadu.
The uproar forced repeated adjournments of the House, whose proceedings for the day were ended minutes past 3 pm following a major clash between opposition and ruling members after Congress leader Azad compared Uri terror attack casualties to the number of deaths which occurred due to demonetisation “crisis”.
Taking strong objection to this, the ruling side termed the comments as “anti-national” and demanded an apology from Congress besides seeking deletion of the remarks from the official records of the Upper House.
India vs England Live score


Azad, while demanding presence of the Prime Minister and asserting that the House will not be allowed to function till he comes there, said 40 people had died following government’s decision on demonetisation.
“People are suffering because of demonetisation. The death toll has reached 40. In the attack by Pakistani terrorists (on army camp) in Uri (in Kashmir), even half of the deaths did not take place. People double than that figure have died due to wrong policy of the government,” he said.
In the Uri attack, 18 army personnel had been killed. In an apparent reference to the cross-LoC surgical strikes carried out by India in PoK after the Uri attack, Azad said, “There should be air strike on BJP….Your wrong policies are responsible for their murders.”
He said since the Prime Minister had made the demonetisation announcement, he should come to the House."

(Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)
The government has so far not discussed the issue of withdrawal of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday. India, she said, had extended the MFN status to Pakistan as a “goodwill gesture” way back in 1996 but unfortunately the neighbouring country has not yet extended the same to New Delhi.
“On the issue of the withdrawal of MFN from Pakistan, strictly speaking, that has not yet been discussed,” she told reporters here.
The decision to withdraw the status or not will have to be taken by the government and “I cannot comment on that”, she added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Last month, government had decided to review the MFN status given to Pakistan at a meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the meeting was postponed.
The review decision was taken in the wake of the Uri attack. India also considered the option of dragging Pakistan to WTO over non-extension of the status.
The neighbouring country has missed its own deadline of December 2012 for giving India this tag.
As per the global trade norms, member countries of the WTO are required to give non-discriminatory market access as part of the MFN status to each other.
The bilateral trade between the countries stood at USD 2.61 billion in 2015-16. Talking about increasing imports from China, the minister said there is no instrument to completely stop imports from one country.
It is impossible to completely ban imports from one country, she added. “But if one wants to restrict the imports because that country is giving more subsidy or on quality issue, then we have instruments like we can impose anti-dumping duties or safeguard measures,” she added.
India has time and again raised the issue of widening trade deficit with China.
In her meeting with Chinese Vice Minister for Finance and Commerce Wang Shouwen, Sitharaman has asked for providing greater market access for Indian products there.
China has assured India that it will act on the concerns expressed by India. In 2015-16, India’s exports to China were USD 9 billion, while imports were USD 61.7 billion, leaving a huge trade deficit of USD 52.7 billion."

File
Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit returns home after an eventful tenure during which the relationship reached some highs, topped by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Lahore on his then counterpart Nawaz Sharif’s birthday on December 25, 2015, and some abysmal lows led by the Pathankot and Uri attacks.
After Sharif recently ordered that Basit be superseded to the Foreign Secretary’s post, in favour of an officer several years his junior, Basit took early retirement from. But less than a week before he was to leave New Delhi, Nawaz Sharif was himself disqualified.
Excerpts from an interview with Jyoti Malhotra.
What do you make of Sharif’s disqualification?
Due process was followed. The National Assembly will be meeting (Tuesday) to elect an interim prime minister. Some people calling this a judicial coup… I would not like to comment. Due process was pursued, followed. As a result of this we have a new prime minister. Some are saying that the Army did not want Sharif because of its old antagonisms with him… This not only passé, but has no basis. It was a judicial process so whatever the judgement given by the Supreme Court, we should accept that. Imran Khan also has a case in the Supreme Court. Do you think he may also be charged similarly? I would not like to jump the gun. Let the law take its course.
Is this a deepening of democracy in Pakistan?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
I think so. I am confident that democracy is indeed taking root. The way our civil society, media judiciary etc have been behaving, we have very high hopes that, inshallah, things getting better in the years ahead.
Where does that lead the India-Pakistan relationship. You have said often that dialogue must go on
Yes, governments come and go..
.and High Commissioners come and go..
Yes.we are talking about two states. Both Pakistan and India need to see how they can put a dialogue process in place which should be uninterrupted and uninterruptible. We hope in some opportune time this will happen. We do have a dialogue mechanism in place which was agreed in December 2015 when External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj visited Pakistan.
…the bilateral dialogue was called off after 18 soldiers were killed in the Uri attack. How do you expect there to be a dialogue after that?
…about 10 days after the Pathankot attacks in the first week of January 2016, the Indian Foreign Secretary was scheduled to visit Pakistan on January 15. But after Pathankot, we realized that this was too soon. Still, both sides maintained a spirit of cooperation to get to the bottom of the Pathankot incident. We could understand that the Indian side would have delayed this by a fortnight or a month, but delaying it indefinitely was not acceptable to Pakistan.
Terror attacks have been going on since the Mumbai attacks nine years ago and Pakistan has not done very much against the masterminds of those attacks.
You have to understand that trials are very complex things. In the Mumbai case, the crime scene was in India, the trial was taking place in Pakistan. In order to complete the trial, take it to its logical conclusion, both countries need to cooperate sincerely. Samjhauta attacks took place in 2008, but we still do not have closure. To say that Pakistan is not interested in concluding the Mumbai trial after nine years is not fair. I will give you an example. Last year, our foreign secretary wrote to his Indian counterpart for information in the Mumbai attacks.
What kind of information did he want?
It was about some kind of equipment used, deposition made in the court, one or two other things. But your side took one year to respond to that letter. They did propose a few things, which we are working on. But if you think Pakistan should be concluding this trial on its own, that won’t happen. We need active Indian cooperation to move forward. And we should not prejudge the outcome of the trial. It is for the court to decide on merit.
The India-Pakistan relationship has been littered with terror attacks, whether in Pathankot or Uri, but in the middle of all this, good things have also happened. Such as the visit of Modi…
Yes, good things have happened as well. The comprehensive dialogue mechanism in 2013, for example. But the problem continues to be, as the two countries decided in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2009, how to separate talks from terrorism.
You think we should continue to talk, including talking on terrorism?
Yes of course. Pakistan has never shied away from talking about terrorism. We are very concerned about that, and the conviction of Kulbhushan Jadhav shows that.
…two national security advisors, Ajit Doval and Nasser Khan Janjua, who met in 2015 in Bangkok, and now there are reports that they have met…
I believe they are in touch with each other. I do not know if they met, I cannot comment on that. Let us hope this will help both countries to come to the negotiating table and discuss all the issues that we have agreed in 2015. I believe they met recently in Moscow… I think you may like to ask your NSA to confirm or not.
But when they are in “touch”, what would be on the agenda? Jammu and Kashmir, terrorism, what?
We do not expect them to discuss Jammu and Kashmir as we have a separate stream on that as was decided in Ufa. We would expect the two FSs to meet as soon as possible to discuss all issues which are important and whose solutions are important to build new bridges of trust and cooperation. But without resolving the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, I do not see how the two countries can put their relations on a solid footing.
But the conversation between the two NSAs… what was that about?
It is not a structured dialogue – they meet informally as they did in Bangkok – but no structured dialogue as such. For that we need the two foreign secretaries to meet.
So you think that the old comprehensive dialogue in which both sides discussed both Kashmir as well as terrorism would work?
Yes we need a comprehensive approach, the document that we agreed upon is a most balanced document – covers J&K, terror, Siachen, everything.
…the SAARC summit that was supposed to take place last year but was cancelled. Is it expected to take place this year in Islamabad?
We are in touch with the SAARC secretariat in Kathmandu. Let us hope when all the members find it convenient to come to the SAARC summit, if not this year then perhaps next year. We are in July and August, these summits need preparation, my personal feeling is that it will be convened next year.
To return to Kulbhushan Jadhav. India has been asking for consular access to him for some time and you have not provided it.
We have not provided consular access to Jadhav because as you know we have a 2008 consular access agreement, whose paragraph 5 clearly says that matters related to security will be decided on merit. Now Commander Jadhav’s case is a sensitive one.
Why is it sensitive?
It is sensitive because he was involved in not only espionage but also subversion. His mother has requested that she would like to go to Pakistan, but you’re not giving her a visa. As you know the matter is sub judice at the International Court of Justice at India’s behest. So we will see what the outcome there at The Hague.
So until that is resolved at the ICJ, you won’t take a decision?
I am not saying that. We will see what is outcome at the Hague… since the matter is being considered at the ICJ. Will be more appropriate till ICJ takes a verdict.
But what about the humanitarian view.
His mercy petitions are still pending. There is no decision by the Army chief yet. If the Army chief rejects mercy petition, another chance to submit appeal to the president. The process is not over. We can talk about issuing a visa to his mother when the time comes.
Do you think Jadhav could be a subject of conversation between the two countries and that the case would depend on an improvement of relations between the two countries.
I do not think Jadhav can be a subject of conversation between two countries. He was tried and convicted on very serious charges so there is no space for conversation. India says he was kidnapped, lured into Pakistan.. What else would India say.
But he was kidnapped.
Not at all. He was arrested in Balochistan. There is no truth in these things. He was travelling under the fake name of Mubarak Hussein Patel. We found two passports in his possession. The evidence is so clear. He has been travelling to Pakistan, this was not the first time. He has been involved in serious terror activities, including funding. Since his arrest we have arrested so many foot-soldiers and operatives inside Pakistan.
How many have you arrested..
More than a hundred, the numbers are in hundreds. We have been able to bust many sleeper cells as well, on the basis of information provided by him. So it is not as simple as it looks. This is quite a serious case. He has been convicted and now his mercy petition is underway.
There is talk that a retired colonel of the ISI, who had apparently come to Lumbini on the India-Nepal border for a job interview, has disappeared.. 
That is correct. And we have sought India’s assistance on the matter.
What have you asked India to do? 
To locate him. To locate his whereabouts.
But why India.
There are apprehensions that he may be in India’s custody, we do not know. So we thought we would approach India to ask if they know about the gentleman. These are apprehensions, there is no harm in asking India.
What are these apprehensions…? 
That he may have strayed into Indian territory. We do not know the exact details.
And have the Indian authorities responded to your request?
No, not yet.
So is there any equivalence between the Jadhav case and Habib Zahir?
Not at all. He was seeking a job. You are mixing apples and oranges,
Are in touch with Nepal authorities?
Yes, but they are saying that they do not know.
…where do India and Pakistan take their relationship from here?
We have to make a fundamental decision, which is that no matter what happens the dialogue process should not discontinue or get disrupted. …I can tell you that we genuinely want relations to improve, to normalize. But you cannot put issues on the back-burner like Jammu &Kashmir, or terrorism.all these issues are important. We need to discuss these issues seriously. Second, we strongly feel that the situation in Jammu & Kashmir needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the CBMs that are in place must continue, as we have invested so much in them. Those should not be allowed to fall apart.
The External Affairs minister has said that medical treatment will require a letter from Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan’s foreign affairs advisor…
That was unfortunate. So now we are looking at sending those medical cases to Turkey and other places. As for the letter, it does not happen that way.
Were you upset by this?
Definitely. These things are not done. If the patients are paying for their treatment, if all their medical documents are in place, then why should India require a letter from the advisor’s office? This is simply incomprehensible.
One last question on Afghanistan. This seems to have become another contested area…
Afghanistan is a very important country for us. We would like our neighbours to stop interfering so that we can promote intra-Afghan reconciliation can take place, which should be left to themselves.
But the Afghans want to improve and enhance their relationship with India…
As a sovereign country, Afghanistan has the full right to have relations with all countries. But their bilateral relations should not be at the expense of a third country.
Should India and Pakistan talk about Afghanistan in a potential dialogue?
I do not know, I don’t think we have reached that stage yet."

As South Block sensed Thursday evening that the Pulwama terrorist attack was turning out to be the single bloodiest attack in Jammu and Kashmir, Joint Secretaries in charge of 17 territorial divisions in the Ministry of External Affairs, from Americas division to the Gulf, West European to South Asian neighbours, all started working their phones.
Setting into motion a “coercive diplomacy” similar to what India has done in the past, after the Uri attack in 2016 and the Mumbai terror attack in 2008, but unprecedented in scale.
At 7.42 pm, the first tweet came from US Ambassador Kenneth Juster, who said that the US Mission in India “strongly condemns” the terrorist attack in Jammu & Kashmir. Expressing condolences, he wrote, “The United States stands alongside India in confronting terror and defeating it.” and signed off with hashtag KashmirTerrorAttack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Officials worked through the night and Ambassadors were asked to either issue statements or ask their foreign ministries — if they were awake and available — to do so.
“Our missions overseas were also told to knock on the doors of the Foreign Ministries and apprise them of the attack and its significance,” a top official said.
By late night, all P-5 countries, except China, and all South Asian neighbours, and major strategic partners had issued statements.
The big gains were condemnations from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran, all major partners of Pakistan, and who routinely support Islamabad on the Kashmir issue, especially during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation declarations each year.
This morning, as the Cabinet Committee on Security decided that MEA would play the lead role in launching the diplomatic offensive, the groundwork had been done overnight.
To start with, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale summoned Pak High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood at 2 pm to his office and issued a “very strong demarche”, sources said. This was their second meeting this month after Pakistan Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had called up Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq.
Gokhale told Mahmood that Pakistan must take “immediate and verifiable action” against the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and that it must “immediately stop any groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories”, sources said.
During the meeting, the Foreign Secretary also dismissed the statement made by the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan yesterday. That had rejected “any insinuation” by elements in the Indian government and media seeking to link the attack to the state of Pakistan without investigations.
By evening, Gokhale called envoys of P-5 countries, US, UK, China, Russia and France, and majority of G-20 countries, and the South Asian neighbours for meetings in batches. A total of about 25 countries were briefed through their envoys in Delhi on Friday evening.
Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria has been called to Delhi for consultations.
Sources said that meetings with envoys from the US, Russia and China took place on one-on-one basis with Gokhale while others were grouped in batches as “like-minded countries”.
“All the envoys were left in no doubt about the role played by Pakistan-based and supported Jaish and our demand that Pakistan ceases forthwith all support and financing to terror groups operating from areas under its control,” an official said.
After the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, the Manmohan Singh government had also briefed envoys from major countries and had given them dossiers about Pakistan’s involvement.
A source said, “There is no dossier this time yet, since the attack is self-professed, and the JeM has claimed responsibility.”
Sources said the coercive diplomacy will be at work over the weekend and in the coming days as well. Secretary (east) Vijay Thakur Singh, Secretary (west) A Gitesh Kumar and Secretary (economic relations) T S Tirumurti in the MEA will continue meeting with Ambassadors.
“Diplomatic isolation cannot happen overnight. It is a process, and the process has begun,” the source said. India will also press with the international community to ensure the early adoption at the UN of the “Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.”
As a pushback, Pak Foreign secretary Tehmina Janjua has also started briefing P-5 envoys about the terrorist attack and what Pak calls the “insinuation” by Delhi."

In your essay on threats to freedom of expression in your new book, Democrats and Dissenters (Penguin, Rs 699), you point out that the political class has never stood up for freedom of speech. Why is it that politicians find it unprofitable to espouse it?
Throughout the freedom movement, because there were curbs on freedom of speech imposed by the British, there were continuous promises made by nationalists that when we become free, we would have freedom of speech. (MK) Gandhi said famously in Young India in 1921 that when we are free, we would remove the sedition law. He also gave a definition of freedom of speech, which says unless you explicitly advocate violence, whatever you say [should not be proscribed]. Why do Indian politicians not support it? Like many other betrayals of the ideals of the founding figures, this is one. Indian politics is now merely about winning elections. In fact, you are told, (Narendra) Modi has won for five years, you cannot criticise him. Or Mamata (Banerjee) has won for five years, you cannot criticise her. But democracy is a process of continuous introspection, questioning and reform.

Do you think it reflects on the people as well, that we have not demanded it of our politicians that they protect our freedom?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Writers and intellectuals are also complicit. Too few of them are non-aligned. I criticised Sahmat about not speaking up for Taslima Nasreen in West Bengal. The RSS will say we are in favour of protecting Salman Rushdie’s freedom of speech, and not Perumal Murugan or MF Husain’s. I don’t think the people are to blame. There is clearly something wrong with us as writers and intellectuals that we cannot work across party lines or beliefs. Often, the Left is as guilty as the right.
 
Do you see the first amendment of the Constitution in 1951 as the start of the slide?
That was a bad precedent. It should have been undone by the late 1950s, when India was secure and not going to Balkanise. It was a failure of (Jawaharlal) Nehru.
You are even-handed in blaming the BJP and the Congress for not defending the right to speech. But do you not see a difference in the way the two parties work in this respect?
[Yes] on intellectual work, generally, and not just on freedom of expression. The BJP is far more ideologically driven, and its standards are much lower. Academic posts, from the Congress onwards, have become instruments of patronage. So, the best person is not appointed, say, as director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, but the second or the third best person is because she/he is seen as more compliant to the first family. But with the BJP, it is the 20th or 30th best person. It is a party hostile to creative work, intellectual work, to thinking, to reflection. It is a profoundly anti-intellectual and Philistine party. Look at the statements our culture minister makes. This government [is guilty], more than the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government, because, somewhere, Vajpayee believed that the arts, culture and scholarship mattered. To this government, economic growth and military might matter, that’s it.
In your essay comparing the insurgencies in Kashmir and Sri Lanka, you say the “Indian arrogance towards Kashmiris has been at times so brutal and extreme as to make reasoned and non-violent protest… perhaps impossible.” How do you see the recent uprising in Kashmir?
I think it is the gravest situation we have faced in Kashmir in many years. It’s partly the accumulation of mistakes made by previous governments. The movement for azaadi in Kashmir is increasingly inflected by Islamic fundamentalism. Today, again, there is a rise of Hindu fundamentalism in India. Maybe, there are wise heads in the government who want to reach out to Kashmir. But that is undermined by the activities on the ground by the Sangh Parivar, who are not fringe elements. Social media has [broadcast the] horrific images of the pellet gun injuries and, the excesses of the Indian security forces are known everywhere in the rest of India. Kashmir gets to see images of the flogging of Muslims and Dalits on the issue of cow. And, a Kashmiri Muslim says, Muslims are not safe in India, and is pushed further towards the jihadis. What was a movement for autonomy, dignity and self-respect becomes a movement for Islamic pride. Let’s be clear: Burhan Wani died for Allah, not for Kashmir. It’s a very tricky and complicated situation where the two fundamentalisms reinforce and fuel each other.
Watch what else is making news

How to move towards solving this? The first step would be for the Prime Minister and the RSS to say that we completely disavow our past positions on Article 370. It will stay and it is inviolate. It is a complicated situation which needs sagacious statesmanship. But some of the remarks by this government after the Uri attack — what Ram Madhav said — was appalling. If Arnab Goswami was to say that, it was fine. If a BJP-affiliated journalist were to say it in The Pioneer, it was fine. But for the general secretary of the party responsible for Kashmir to make such a crude and irresponsible statement shows the unwisdom in the government.
The epigraph to your book is a quote by Benedict Anderson: “No one can be a true nationalist who is incapable of feeling ashamed of her [or his] government commits crimes, including those against their fellow citizens.” How do you look at the recent debate on being anti-national?
The nationalism of Gandhi, Nehru and (BR) Ambedkar was inflected by a sense of shame. They were ashamed of our treatment of women and Dalits. Indian nationalism, as conceived by them, was a work in progress. It was not flawless, it was always imperfect. The attempt would be to strive to correct those imperfections as opposed to a nationalism that says: “Mera bharat mahaan”, “Bharat mata ki jai”. The idea that there should be a 207 ft high flag in every central university which you can see from everywhere is utterly farcical. It is a nationalism of insecurity and paranoia, parading as a nationalism of might and self-confidence.
How do you see the JNU debate in this light? What did it achieve and what did it cede?
Personally, I think the JNU debate is not as important to someone living in Bangalore. It was covered because the media is in Delhi.
The protests at Hyderabad University were also covered.
Hyderabad was covered for a different reason. It was more important, there was clear victimisation there. But I didn’t follow the JNU debate very carefully. I do think that to reclaim a nationalism that is reflective and interrogative is important for the Left and liberals. It has allowed the right and the RSS to say: ‘only we are patriotic, only we are nationalists.’
I was recently reading JP (Jayaprakash Narayan) on Kashmir. Here is a leader the Sangh Parivar respects. He thinks that our treatment of Kashmir is a black mark on Indian democracy, which it is. He says, ‘To suppress the Kashmiris by force is a suicide of the soul of India’. Leaders like JP truly loved the country, they wanted to reform it. They were fearless in criticising its failings. They had a sense of shame. But they were nationalists.
Do you still believe that the Congress needs to be Gandhi-mukt?
That was my belief till recently, till about a year ago. That it needs to rid of the Gandhis. But now I think the Congress is dead. It is terminally ill. It’s done what it has to do and it should now die. And Indians will find a way to occupy that political space.
The RSS has spoken of reviewing the Constitution. What do you think of that idea?
Vajpayee’s government (also) appointed a “Constitution review committee” because the RSS was saying it had to be re-examined. They appointed as the chairman of the committee a man called MN Venkatachaliah, a former chief justice of India. He was a devout Hindu in his personal life, who did puja twice a day. They must have thought that because of his personal, spiritual leanings, this man would be inclined to the RSS point of view. He consulted scholars across the board, specialists, legal scholars, and, basically, wrote a report saying nothing needs to be done to the Constitution. The RSS didn’t want to hear that, but maybe Vajpayee did. He could be quite clever that way."

Asserting that Pakistan was “exposed and isolated” at the international level, Jammu and Kashmir BJP on Thursday said it was the victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s diplomacy. “After the Uri attack on our soldiers, Pakistan has been exposed and isolated at international level and it is the victory of the PM Narendra Modi’s diplomacy,” BJP State President and MLA Sat Sharma said.
Sharma, who visited Mawa, Ragal, Chack Sadda, Londi, Bobiya, Sadoh, Kangwala, Kullian, Suchetgarh, Pandhour villages of Hiranagar and Samba border Assembly constituencies, met with the people, listened to their grievances and also sought details about the prevailing situation in these border touching villages.
He said the surgical strikes on launch pads in PoK has “frustrated” Pakistan and it is indulging in “unprovoked firing” on Indian side which is being taken very seriously.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Although the government has asked the people living in villages touching border with Pakistan to move to safer places, there are many villages whose residents have displayed valour to stay and face Pakistan,” Sat said, adding that the people living near the border have always served as a second line defence during all the wars.
He stressed upon the local officers of the administration to ensure availability of all the essential commodities in these villages.
The people, while putting forth their demand of constructing bunkers at safer places, provision of 5 marla plots, proper utilisation of funds, said that they have been living of zero line of International border and need to be given all such benefits which are being extended to their counterparts on Line of Control.
They also demanded for making adequate arrangement for uninterrupted studies of their wards.
Sharma assured the people living near the border that whatever genuine demands have been put by them, will be taken up with the Modi government at the earliest."

It took five years and director Ali Abbas Zafar to bring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif back on the big screen in their upcoming film Tiger Zinda Hai. But looks like the amount of love the two are already getting from their fans, they might return with another project sooner. And this time, Karan Johar’s production house Dharma Productions is to be thanked. If reports are to be believed, Karan Johar wants to cast Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan in his next film.
As per speculations, Karan is highly impressed by the chemistry Katrina and Salman share. He has thus made up his mind to use the best of their camaraderie in this upcoming film. According to a report in DNA, a source was quoted saying, “While KJo’s next directorial will be with Ranbir Kapoor, he wants to produce a film with Salman and Katrina in the lead as he finds their chemistry sizzling. Earlier, the same film was to star Pakistan actor Fawad Khan along with Katrina, but with the ban on Pakistani actors during Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, that is not happening. Hence the filmmaker was keen to rope in Salman. The script is being reworked for Dabangg Khan and to make the character more suitable to him. The pre-production work on the film has begun.”
The report further claims that Karan Johar was ready to begin work on a musical romantic film, apparently titled Raat Baaki, with Katrina Kaif and Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in lead roles. But the Uri attack happened in September last year, followed by a ban on Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood. Karan had to face a tough time during the release of his directorial Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, owing to Fawad’s presence in it. Though the Ranbir Kapoor-Anushka Sharma film did manage to release and become a hit, KJo preferred to remove Fawad Khan as the lead of his next film. Now, reports claim that the same film might just have Salman Khan coming on board.

Controversy and Bollywood go hand-in-hand and 2016 successfully produced some gems that kept gossip mills churning overtime and news TRPs hitting the rooftop. We take a look at those Bollywood controversies that created maximum noise.
The big Katrina Kaif-Ranbir Kapoor break up

They tried sealing their love with a kiss just days before the New Year but that was not enough. The beginning of the year 2016 created such violent tremors in their relationship that both Ranbir and Katrina decided to call it quits and ditch their expensive love nest to find solace in their old homes. Katrina weathered the storm with a stoic silence while Ranbir withdrew into a shell before opening up about Katrina in a couple of interviews. Katrina, meanwhile, got back to her gym and worked out with vengeance to carve out an ultra hot body. Apparently hitting the gym was her way of dealing with a break-up. One wonders how these two former lovers will come together to promote Jagga Jasoos. Who knows they may well patch-up before the movie’s release for stranger things have happened in Bollywood.
Aamir Khan ends intolerance talk

Aamir Khan very well knows how to swing the tide in his favour when the going gets tough. After being slammed for his statements on intolerance, Aamir chose the Republic Day week to settle the dust once and for all. Organising an event to celebrate 10 years of Rang De Basanti, Aamir used the platform effectively to put forward what exactly he meant by his statements made at the Indian Express conclave and reiterated his love towards his motherland India.
Amitabh Bachchan and Panama Papers

This one shook the towering legend of Hindi cinema. When Indian Express as part of its ongoing investigation into The Panama Papers broke the story about Bachchan being a director of four offshore shipping companies between 1993 to 1997, fans all across were taken aback. The superstar through a statement denied all the allegations levelled against him. Aishwarya Rai’s name also cropped up and the actress too denied all such allegations. The image of Bachchan took a beating for a while but the star bounced back with a power-packed performance in Pink and all was forgotten.
The Kangana Ranaut and Hrithik Roshan saga
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2909996"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg"" alt=""hrithik-kangana-759"" width=""759"" height=""422"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/hrithik-kangana-7591.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" />

If there has ever been a case of washing dirty Bollywood linen in public in recent times, it is the Kangana-Hrithik saga. It all started with Kangana referring to Hrithik as her silly ex. Hrithik took deep offence and in order to wipe his slate clean, sent Kangana a legal notice demanding an unconditional apology. But Kangana proved to be made of sterner stuff. She gave Hrithik a feisty reply and that started a chain of scandals where almost everyday, sources belonging to either camps used to leak out information to the press about the alleged affair. Meanwhile, Kangana went from strength to strength and also went ahead to win yet another National Award while Hrithik went down in the dumps after delivering a dud in the form of Mohenjo Daro. The highlight of the scandal was Kangana’s boldness — be it talking openly about Hrithik at various public forums or calling him someone who needed his father for help even today.

The usually reticent Arijit Singh decided to indulge in some late night publicity and posted a rather long and weepy note on Facebook lamenting how his rendition of Jag Ghoomeya was dropped and replaced by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan’s version because one man didn’t fancy hin – the Bhai of Bollywood, Salman Khan. So Arijit wanted the world to believe Salman edited out his song because of an unruly episode that happened at an awards show years ago where Arijit ended up ticking Salman the wrong way. The singer on Facebook begged and pleaded with Salman to retain his song but Salman couldn’t care less. In his inimitable style, the superstar — when asked about the matter — responded with a cavalier remark, “Arijit..Who is that?”
Salman Khan’s raped woman remark

In the interview, Salman compared his condition and feeling after wrestling training with being raped. That was enough for Arnab Goswami and the rest of the world to take him down. Papa Salim Khan had to apologise yet again for his son’s misadventures. Yet there was no let-up. Bollywood too ditched the actor and many including Kangana slammed the actor for passing a rather insensitive remark. The women’s commission too jumped the bandwagon increasing Salman’s trouble. The actor decided to stay mum and weathered the storm.

Anurag Kashyap and Co got the best publicity of their lives, courtesy Pahlaj Nihalani. Udta Punjab was brutally censored by Nihalani who enforced 94 cuts on the film. The industry came together to fight it out in the court of law and won finally. But the man who dominated the television screens and news prints was Anurag Kashyap who was hailed for single-handedly taking on Nihalani. Kashyap and team refused to budge and fought their case tooth and nail to finally won an A-certificate with one cut. Despite the widespread controversy and publicity, the film did only average business.

Ajay Devgn did the unthinkable when he catapulted KRK to national fame by releasing a taped conversation between the self-proclaimed critic and Ajay’s business manager Kumar Mangat. In the audio, KRK is heard making claims about having received Rs 25 lakh from Karan Johar to tweet positive things about Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, at the expense of Shivaay. An enraged Ajay demanded investigation while Karan Johar at Express Adda made it clear that it was beneath his dignity to even respond to such allegations. Meanwhile, KRK lapped up all attention coming his way with glee.

Just when Karan Johar thought he had weathered the Ajay Devgn-KRK storm, in came a jolt from the blue in the form of Raj Thackeray. The politician used the Uri attacks as the perfect platform to launch himself into spotlight by training his guns on Bollywood. His first demand was to delete all Pakistan actors sequences from Hindi films like Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Raees and others. The MNS supremo also made it clear no Pakistani actors are welcome in India anymore. Karan initially maintained calm but as Raj stepped up the ante, a few single screen owners joined the chorus by deciding not to screen ADHM as their mark of solidarity to the martyrs. As things started getting worse and calls of Karan being unpatriotic started doing the rounds, the harrowed filmmaker immediately posted a video to prove his patriotism and to request one and all to allow his movie to be screened. Finally, Raj relented after CM Devendra Fadnavis brokered peace between the warring parties. Raj, however, had the last laugh by asking filmmakers to pay Rs 5 crore to Army fund for working with Pakistani actors.
Raj Thackeray and SRK

Afraid of protests, SRK visited Raj and nipped things in the bud. Many, of course, slammed SRK for bowing before Raj.

Anurag squandered away all goodwill earned during his Udta Punjab fight by blaming PM Modi for the mess Karan Johar found himself in owing to MNS protest against Pakistani actors. Anurag through his tweeted criticised the PM for his silence on the issue. Social media users didn’t take Anurag’s tweets too kindly and gave it back to him left, right and centre. The maverick director lost the plot when he made public the phone number of a female journalist who was chasing him for an interview. After severe backlash, Anurag decided to opt for silence and peace. One hasn’t heard from him ever since.

Global star Priyanka Chopra unwittingly landed herself in trouble after a T-shirt that she wore for a fashion magazine’s cover was labelled insensitive in nature. The T-shirt had the words Refugee, Immigrant and Outsider stricken out leaving Traveller as the only right choice. Chopra was accused of being insensitive towards the plight of refugees. The actress quickly issued an apology by saying, ” I am really, really apologetic about the fact that sentiments were hurt . The point the magazine wanted to make was actually something good.”

Divorce decree by church invalid: SC
The Supreme Court’s order Thursday that divorce decrees by ecclesiastical tribunals under the canon law will have no validity and that Christian couples must abide by the statutory law to have their marriages legally annulled is still one of the top stories today. The order assumes significance especially when there are a host of petitions before the apex court demanding triple talaq to be declared unconstitutional. The ruling was in response to a three-year PIL filed by Clarence Pais, a advocate and a former president of the Catholic Association of Dakshina Kannada in Karnataka. Read more

1 lakh crore fund for safety on tracks
The Centre is planning to create a special fund, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) of Rs 1 lakh crore for critical safety upgrades required on railway tracks. The move follows the Kanpur train accident in November, 2016 in which at least 140 people were killed. There have been calls from railway experts that the government needs to seriously consider the upgradation of tracks to avoid accidents and casualties. For the first time, a separate Rail Budget will not be presented this year. But the Finance Ministry under Arun Jaitley has given Rs 55,000 crore as Gross Budgetary Support, the highest ever allocation to the transporter. Read more
SP not inclined to tie up with RLD in UP polls
The big development in the Uttar Pradesh elections is the decision of the Samajwadi Party not to align with Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). The ruling party, which is likely to announce an alliance with the Congress any day now, feels its core Muslim support base in western parts of the state may wither away in case of an alliance with RLD. RLD’s core voter base emanates from Jats. The SP wants to contest on at least 300 seats with 100 odd seats allocated to the Congress. Read more

(Reuters)
Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that militant organisations are active in the country and questioned Islamabad’s policy to allow the “non-state actors” to cross the border and “kill” people in Mumbai. This is a rare admission from a top Pakistan political leader, almost 10 years after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. His party is still in the ruling establishment, whose term expires in May-end.
Sharif, who has been disqualified from holding public office for life by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case, said Pakistan has isolated itself. “We have isolated ourselves. Despite giving sacrifices, our narrative is not being accepted. Afghanistan’s narrative is being accepted, but ours is not. We must look into it,” he said in an interview to Pakistan’s leading newspaper, Dawn.
Without naming Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and Maulana Masood Azhar’s militant organisations — Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Jaish-e-Mohammad — operating in the country with impunity, Sharif said: “Militant organisations are active in Pakistan… Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill over 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can’t we complete the trial.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Mumbai attacks-related trials are stalled in a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court. “It’s absolutely unacceptable (to allow non-state actors to cross the border and commit terrorism there). President (Vladimir) Putin has said it. President Xi (Jinping) has said it,” he said.
Citing the military and judiciary establishment, Sharif said: “You can’t run a country if you have two or three parallel governments. This has to stop. There can only be one government — the constitutional one.” Sharif, known for his pro-India views, is perceived by Pakistan’s Army as a politician who has challenged their authority.
In the last few years, Sharif tried to improve bilateral ties with India, but terrorist attacks in Pathankot — a week after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lahore — scuttled the dialogue process. This was followed by Kulbhushan Jadhav’s sentencing, and Uri attacks, thereby derailing the dialogue process."

(Source: AP File)
BCCI president Anurag Thakur will make an unprecedented request to the ICC asking them not to place India and Pakistan in the same group at the Champions Trophy in seven months’ time, so as to avoid the two teams from clashing. Though bilateral series have stopped since 2012, the two teams have routinely played each other in multi-nation tournaments like World Cups.
But with bilateral political relations deteriorating and government trying to isolate Pakistan, BCCI today decided that India will avoid playing Pakistan even in multi-nation tournaments when taking their request to ICC. The issue was discussed on the sidelines of the Special General Meeting here against the backdrop of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of Uri terror attack and the subsequent cross-LoC “surgical strikes” carried out by the Indian army. Anurag Thakur is an MP of the ruling BJP and said it was “in view of the public sentiment in the country.”
“I will be suggesting to the ICC that looking at the current situation between both countries it is not advisable to have India and Pakistan in one group of Champions Trophy as there could be situation like we had in India during India vs Pakistan T20 World game in Dharamshala where we had to shift the game at the last moment,” he said.

He added, “There could be security issues. So in order the organisers don’t face problems which we did during T20 World Cup, I will be suggesting to the ICC in our next meeting in October in South Africa that it will be better if we don’t have two teams in the same group.”
Many members of the BCCI had told Thakur this, he said, on the sidelines of the board’s meeting adding, “The matter is of concern. We felt that it will be better if we inform ICC nine months in advance so that ICC should not face any kind of problem in future. I will be writing a letter also to ICC on this soon.”
The ICC reacting to media reports said they had not received any request from BCCI in this regard and if any request comes in the future then the ICC board will decide on it, a spokesperson said.If the two countries reach the semi-finals and have to clash at that time, it is another situation which can’t be avoided, Thakur added. Given the high interest and commercial value of the clash between the traditional rivals, the ICC generally puts the two teams in the same group in multi-nation tournaments to attract more spectators.
India’s not been playing bilateral tournaments for a while and after the Uri attacks, the situation has worsened.
Ajmal, Afridi for cricket ties 

Lahore: Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal noted that in the past cricket had helped reduce tensions and normalise relations between the two countries and called for resumption of bilateral cricket ties with India. “In the past also having cricket series helped reduced tensions and I firmly believe there should be cricket between the two countries,” Ajmal told reporters in Muzaffarabad,
Afridi took to Twitter to push for a peaceful resolution of the recent hostilities between Pakistan and India. Afridi said Pakistan had always been a “peaceful nation” and that when two neighbours fought it “affected both”"

Maharashta Navnirman Sena threatended Pakistani artists to go back to the country after the Uri attacks that killed 18 soldiers. They single-handedly lead the protest against the release of Karan Johar’s ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ because Fawad Khan has played a role in it. However, after repeated efforts to lift the ban, by Johar and other members of the film industry, MNS chief Raj Thakeray told reporters today that every producer who has cast Pakistani artists in their films will give Rs 5 crore to the army relief fund.
“We have always protested against Pakistani artistes but Bollywood never understood earlier. Now they have realised. Terrorist attacks have always been happening. I told Mukesh Bhatt. Pakistan bans our films and channels as per whims and fancies. So why are we rolling the red carpet for Pakistani actors, ” said Thackeray.
He also said that they must give the same in writing that they will not work with Pakistani artists in future. “CM asked me about the solution. Karan Johar will display a slate of tribute for Uri martyrs before Ae Dil Hai Mushkil starts playing out on the screens. Producers guild should give us a written undertaking that no Pakistani actors will be cast in our films,” he said after the meeting brokered by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But his move hasn’t gone down well with people on social media who see it as “extortion”. This is what Twitterati had to say.

After Amit Shah claimed that “more than 250 terrorists” were killed when the Indian Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camp in Balakot on February 26, former Army chief and Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh Tuesday said the death toll is not a “confirmed figure” and that the BJP chief meant that these many “might have died” in the air strike.
“That (casualty figure) was based on people who were housed in the buildings which were hit, it’s an estimate. He is not saying this is a confirmed figure, he is saying this many might have died,” Singh said when asked about Shah’s claim.
In a “non-military pre-emptive action”, the Indian Air Force Mirage 2000 fighters destroyed a Jaish terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26, a week after the terror group claimed responsibility of a suicide attack in Kashmir’s Pulwama in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed on February 14.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Watch video: We hit terror targets, can’t count casualties, says Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa

A report in The Indian Express quoted top government sources saying IAF hit the four buildings it targeted, but limitations of technical intelligence and lack of ground intelligence at this point make any assessment of terrorists killed in the attack “purely speculative”.
While the government hasn’t yet provided details on the number of casualties in the strike, Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa Monday said the “Air Force is not in a position to clarify how many people were inside (the target). We don’t count human casualties. We count what targets have been hit, or not hit”.
Responding to a query on the number of terrorists killed, Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa has said: “That statement will be made by the government… The bomb damage assessment that is done post mission calculates the number of targets that you have been able to hit, or not been able to hit. We can’t count how many people have died. That depends on how many people were there.”
BJP president Amit Shah, however, said on Sunday that “more than 250 terrorists” were killed in the airstrike. “After the Uri attack, the army did a surgical strike. After the Pulwama attack, people said there could not be a surgical strike due to the high level of alertness. But on the 13th day, the Narendra Modi government carried out an airstrike, and more than 250 terrorists were killed without suffering any losses,” Shah had said.
Opposition leaders including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and BSP chief Mayawati, have questioned the government over the veracity of the claims of the death toll after international media reports suggested that hardly anybody was killed in the airstrike by the IAF.
In a rally Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Opposition of demoralising the armed forces by “raising doubts” and “asking for proof” of the Balakot airstrike.
“While we are out to counter terrorism across the border, what are some people inside the country doing? Instead of boosting the morale of our forces, they are speaking in a language which is lighting up the faces of our enemies. Pakistan TV is airing their statements and faces, and people in Pakistan are applauding them,” he said."

With Pakistani artistes in India facing threats from parties like MNS following the Uri terror attack, controversial BJP MLA Sangeet Som has said that they should be “beaten with shoes”. “There are quite a few artistes who are earning crores from here, no one cares about them in Pakistan. They come to Bollywood and earn in crores then they do ‘Gaddari’ (betrayal) with India,” Som, the MLA from Sardhana in UP, said.
“They should have given Pakistan a message that we eat and earn here (India) so such incidents (of terrorism) should not happen here,” said Som, an accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013. In the wake of the Uri attack by Pakistan-based terrorists which killed 18 Indian soldiers, Raj Thackeray’s MNS had told Pakistani actors to leave India immediately, threatening to disrupt the shooting of their movies if they do not comply.

Congress Friday hit back at the government for dubbing anyone asking questions as “anti-national” and accused the Modi dispensation of being the “real threat” to national security after it invited “our enemies” and ISI to Indian territory and country’s defence establishments.
Congress also questioned the government’s decision for putting on hold its order on NDTV India to be off-air for a day and said if it felt their decision stood ground it should face it boldly instead. Accusing BJP of doing politics of hypocrisy, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal said that it does not do such kind of politics and will continue to raise questions in public interest which the government will have to answer.
“Those who don’t know how terrorists entered the nation and attacked us and killed our forces. They are the real security threat. Threat to national security is the terrorist entering our nation, not the person who is asking questions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Whoever criticises the government and asks questions is a threat to national security. Who is the real threat?
“Those who invite our enemies and ISI to our territory, to our own defence establishment they are real threat to national security,” he said.
Sibal said those who oppose the government, sedition charges are slapped on them and whose who asked questions were dubbed as anti-nationals.
“We don’t do hypocritical politics. They do it. When we were in government, we tried to answer every question directed at us,” he said.
The Congress leader said while Prime Minister says there should be no politics on surgical strikes, he and Amit Shah only talks about that ahead of Uttar Pradesh elections.
He asked why did Modi allow ISI to enter Pathankot air base and who was held accountable for the Uri attacks where the country’s brave soldiers died.
He asked where was the probe on Pathankot terror attack when the terrorists entered from across the border.
“Was there a probe? Who was responsible for this defence lapse?
“How did terrorists reach Gurdaspur? Was there a probe? Who was responsible? Wasn’t the government responsible to find out?,” he asked, saying Congress will continue to raise questions on such crucial issues.
Sibal said the government says there is a difference between the freedom of expression and national security and asked why did Modi ask questions when the Mumbai terror attacks happened.
“In 26/11 Modi ji reached Mumbai when the Taj was being attacked. Modiji gave a TV byte and criticised the Government,” he said, asking whether this did not make him anti-national.
He asked, “should the people of this country not ask questions” and said a Union Minister has said that asking questions is contrary to our culture while another one dubs those asking as “anti nationals”.
Sibal said “We have heard that powers that be have started saying, don’t question me,” and that is what is happening in this country."

With the Congress out of power in Punjab for 10 years and fast losing ground across the country, Amarinder Singh, the Punjab unit president who is seen as the party’s chief ministerial face, is among the key players in the party’s plans for a revival in the Assembly elections scheduled for 2017.

Nirupama Subramanian: What do you make of the Uri attack? What are the options before India?
I think we encourage these sort of things by making the Army play soft and say we are all for peace. Unless you break the backbone of terrorism in Kashmir, nobody will come to negotiate with you. And Pakistan will continue to be this sort of nuisance. On the other hand, there has to be a thorough inquiry into why this happened. Two battalions, 6 Bihar and 10 Dogras, were changing hands but that does not mean you let your guard down. It was the duty of 10 Dogra to hold until 6 Bihar had shifted in. I think an inquiry needs to be done from this angle. The Indian government must also have some mechanism in place. I don’t say ‘declare war’, but I believe in the old system of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Something has to be done or you will demoralise your forces and the country will ask you questions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Maneesh Chhibber: What do you expect the PM to do after all that talk in the election campaign that the NDA will be tougher on terrorism?
We cannot discuss solutions sitting across the table in a newspaper office. These need to be discussed with the defence forces. He (PM Modi) must have talked to the Army chief, who will certainly have solutions. It should be that if they kill 10 of ours, we should kill 20 of theirs. And in the Valley, there has to be a no-nonsense approach. I am contradicting myself but I oppose shooting of children; I think it is absolutely inhuman. You cannot shoot children with pellet guns, blow their eyes out and think peace will come. You are sowing the seeds of future bitterness. When there is a crisis like this (in Kashmir), you have rubber bullets that you use on the lower extremities of the body. Eventually though, you have to talk. In Punjab, you had to talk (to quell the insurgency of the ’80s and ’90s).
Khushboo Sandhu: Punjab is going to polls. How do you see the situation developing, especially after the emergence of the Aam Aadmi Party?
When the elections were held in 2014 (Lok Sabha), nobody took the AAP seriously and nobody gauged the mood in the countryside. Obviously there was a lot of bitterness, a lot of frustration, which came out in those elections. In my seat (Amritsar parliamentary constituency), I thought Daljeet Singh (the AAP candidate) would get about 25,000 votes, but he polled over 80,000. The Patiala candidate (Dharamvira Gandhi) garnered 3,25,000 votes. But I think they peaked with that election. After that, it has been all downhill for them. I will give you an example. After I won Amritsar, I had to resign from Patiala (the Assembly seat). Preneet (Kaur, Amarinder’s wife) contested from Patiala. During the LS election, though she lost, she led Patiala (city) by 4,000 votes. In the by-election, she won it by 24,000 votes. The AAP chap lost his deposit. So, I do not see them as a major threat this time. They are divided. I think this business of (Arvind) Kejriwal forcing others on Punjab is not acceptable. Punjabis want a Punjabi to rule them.
Kanchan Vasdev: The AAP has denied that Kejriwal will be the Punjab chief ministerial candidate. Do you still think he will declare himself as one at some point?
I think he will. I do not know what the constitutional provision is — if a chief minister in one state can fight as an MLA in another, or if he has to resign from the CM post. But if he decides to fight, I have told him I will fight against him. Not out of great bravado but I will stand for my state. I do not want somebody from outside (Haryana) who we are fighting with all the time. Our disputes are with them (Haryana) on everything. How can a man from there come here in Punjab? My guess is that he will hope his party wins and then have somebody quit and (he will) fight a by-election later. He is a slippery customer. I think this is the way he will function.
Jagdeep Singh Deep: How do you see this fourth front (Awaaz-e-Punjab floated by Navjot Singh Sidhu)?
I call them the ‘tonga’ party: two in the front and two at the back. But if you look at them individually and their standing as of today, Pargat Singh (suspended Akali MLA and former hockey captain) cannot win his seat, nor can the younger Bains (Independent MLA Simarjit Singh). In case of Navjot Sidhu, he does not know people beyond Amritsar, where he was elected as MP, and Patiala, where he was born.
Navjeevan Gopal: At one point, you were keen on having Navjot Sidhu in your party.
No, I was not keen to have him. What I said was that these three leaders, Inderbir Bolaria (Akali MLA), Sidhu and Pargat Singh, have Congress DNA and if they wish to join the party, then they are welcome. Bolaria’s father was a Congress general secretary and was very close to me. Bhagwant Singh Sidhu (Navjot’s father) was the general secretary when my mother was the DCC (District Congress Committee) president, Patiala. After she became a Rajya Sabha member in 1992, he became the president. He was a very good man; it is a Patiala family. Pargat’s father-in-law Darbara Singh died as the governor of Rajasthan. He was also the speaker of the Punjab Assembly. That is what I had said. They chose to form their own group; it’s fine.
Man Aman Singh Chhina: Navjot Sidhu says you and the Akalis are two sides of the same coin. In the day you abuse each other and in the evening you hug and party together.
Can anyone prove that I have met Mr Badal in 10 years other than in the Vidhan Sabha? Or had a conversation with him or with Sukhbir (Singh Badal) or Bikram Majithia (Akali minister) other than the one time they came to my grandson’s wedding? Why did they come? Because my grandson’s family also has Majithia blood and it was a social event. I went once to Badal’s village when his wife died. You cannot cut out niceties and social life altogether. You have to do this.
Vinod Kumar: The Congress has not done well in other states. Are you under pressure to deliver in Punjab?
I do not know about the Congress party, but I am under pressure. I have lost twice and I don’t intend to lose another election. And I want to go out of the political world after having achieved that. This is my last election. I think the time has come for a new generation. I am 74 now and by the time of the next election, I will be 80. I do not want to be like Parkash Singh Badal (Punjab chief minister). He can contest the next election too.
Maneesh Chhibber: In 2012, you said you lost because they did not allow you your choice of candidates. It’s still the same high command.
Today they realise that the selection (of candidates in the last election) was not proper. I had protested then as 39 seats were given to people who were not in a position to win. Seven seats were handed to the Youth Congress and they were the choice of the Youth Congress headquarters. Of these 46 seats, we won in six. This time, Mrs Gandhi has publicly said they were the wrong choice. I think this time, the Congress will have a proper selection process.
Sanjeev Verma: The Congress has been reduced to six states in the country. Recently, we had the case of Arunachal Pradesh. Does it call for a change at the top level?
No, I don’t think any change is needed at the top level. But I think the general secretaries, who are looking after states, must have an understanding of their respective states. They must spend more time in their states like our general secretary (Himachal MLA Asha Kumari). She was here for a meeting with me in the morning. If you take on responsibility, then it is the job of the general secretary to see how things are running. Otherwise things are alright. I never had any problem while functioning with party vice-president (Rahul Gandhi) and the president (Sonia Gandhi). I think I have not met the vice-president for a month but we function through SMSes. I get a response within two hours. It is a much easier system.
Nirupama Subramanian: But the high command hasn’t announced you as CM candidate yet. What do you make of that?
When they announced me (as CM candidate) the last time, it was a bit late, three-four days before polling. In my case, it is more or less taken for granted because IPAC (Indian Political Action Committee formed by political strategist Prashant Kishor) is only concentrating on Amarinder Singh and not on the Congress. This is being paid for by the AICC and not us. It indicates what they want. They will do it (naming him CM candidate) at an appropriate time.
Maneesh Chhibber: In 2002, you came out strongly against the Badals, even saying you would send them to jail. Now we don’t hear these things from you. What has changed?
Many people think that we and the Akalis are together because our attacks have become less virulent. I think with age, people change too. Not that your attitude towards the Akalis has changed. You attack them on the same issues but with facts and figures rather than with abuse and other things. He (Chief Minister Parkash Badal) is 94 and I am 74. If we abuse each other, it is not going to solve any problem. I am attacking Sukhbir, his father and his brother-in-law (Cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia) at every stage.
Kanchan Vasdev: Do you think that your line on not calling for a CBI inquiry against Majithia (in the synthetic drug racket case) has gone against you?
I absolutely stand by the statement. Under the law, once an inquiry is on, you don’t change it. This inquiry is being conducted by a very competent officer who I know. He was a major in the Guards Regiment of the Army and was the SSP in Jalandhar when he got after these guys. They then transferred him to Fatehgarh Sahib. He got after them there. Then he was transferred to Patiala. Before they could transfer him, he had nabbed Bhola (wrestler-turned-cop Jagdish Bhola and alleged kingpin of the racket) and all these guys. That is the question to be asked. When the investigation began, it involved four Central agencies. You had the Enforcement Directorate, you had the Income Tax, the narcotics division and you had Revenue and Intelligence. The same agencies which would have supported the CBI. What would have happened in the CBI? You would have waited another 10 years for something to happen. Here it is in the final stages of investigation and the High Court has said we will monitor the investigation. I have been told that the other day, the High Court made an observation by asking them (the SAD-BJP government), why the delay. That is what I want to know. Why the delay? The Income Tax is under whom? (Union Finance Minister Arun) Jaitley. The ED is under whom? Jaitley. Why are they protecting these guys? They are looking at the elections. They do not care about Punjab.
Maneesh Chhibber: At one point you were a strong votary of interaction between Indian and Pakistani Punjab?
After we undertook one or two visits, we organised a cricket match in Mohali between us and them. I managed to get 5,000 visas for the cricket fans but we did not know where to put them up. We had a panchayat bhavan and other places ready, but I made a request through the papers that these people are coming (from Pakistan) and if anyone would like to invite them into their homes, please do so. Not one man stayed with the government; people took them home. That feeling exists on both sides of the border. When our boys go there and shop at Nankana Sahib, people there do not take money. That feeling is there. It is politics that keeps us apart.
Nirupama Subramanian: If you become the CM, would you restart the initiative?
I would like that to start because this killing business has to stop. I feel this as a soldier. Our borders should be left completely to ourselves and their borders should be the way they want it. I told Pervez Musharraf when I met him that Kashmir is the stumbling block. I said why don’t you look at it this way? I am a soldier, you are a soldier. You know what happened in Italy in 1943. Cassino (where German troops had dug defensive lines to protect Rome) held up the advance of both the British and American armies. After a bloody battle, all the Americans did was bypass Cassino and land at Anzio, south of Rome, and Cassino became irrelevant. I said (to Musharraf), ‘I know Kashmir is a problematic place and much more complex. Why don’t we attempt this? Start trade, tourism and business and gradually Kashmir may fade into the background’. He said, ‘You have a point but I have a more complex problem. I have to deal with a great deal of militant thought.’ Frankly, if some good could have come between us at Agra (summit of 2001) or perhaps later, it could only come when Musharraf was in power because he was both the Chief of the Army Staff and president of Pakistan and had immense power. It was sad it was sabotaged at Agra.
Varinder Bhatia: How soon can we expect the Congress list?
We have got 1,600 applications; we’ve never had so many. They (the high command) have sent us a docket which has to be filled in a particular way. That exercise is on. Once it is ready, say in a week, we will send it. Then it will go to the committee of secretaries who will screen it. Hopefully, it will come to Mrs Gandhi when she is better and Rahul when he finishes a month in UP. I think, maybe, in three or four weeks.
Jaskiran Kapoor: Do you feel religion and politics should be separated?
I think it should be. I am very upset with this Supreme Court ruling (the apex court disposed of a petition that in effect allows an amendment disenfranchising Sehajdhari or non-baptised Sikhs in SGPC elections). They have no business to let Sehajdharis stay out. The Akalis want this because they know that those who cut their hair or beard are more liberal; they are not amritdharis and will not vote for them. If tomorrow, somebody from Kerala becomes a Sikh, then he has every right as any Sikh. Once you have joined a religion, you have joined a religion. Similarly, if a young boy is born to Sikh parents and decides he doesn’t want to keep his hair and beard, you can’t say he is no longer a Sikh. What is the Supreme Court doing? This is the kind of thing they should be looking into and not endorsing what the Akalis want. I think liberalism is being pushed into a corner.
Nirupama Subramanian: You have seen what’s happening over Cauvery. If there is a Supreme Court verdict that is unfavourable to Punjab on the SYL (Satluj-Yamuna Link canal) issue and if you are in government, will you uphold that verdict?
No. Not at all. If the judgment comes and it goes against us, which it is likely from what we are hearing, we will all quit and force a fresh election. We will go back to the House and we will bring about another law to protect our interests. The fact is there is something called Riparian Principle, under which states have the right to water only from where the natural flow goes — the basins. Whether it is Canada or America or anywhere in the world, the Riparian Principle is the way. In this case, the Sutlej water is not riparian to Haryana. Of the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi waters, we have got 12 MAF (million acre-feet) of water and Haryana has got 8 MAF. But the 7 MAF of water from Yamuna at the Tajewala head works is not coming to us but goes to Haryana. So they have got 15 MAF of water and we have got 12 MAF. Why? Because the Yamuna is not riparian to Punjab. Then, how is the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej riparian to Haryana? They are not in the natural flow area. You are carrying water from the Sutlej to Haryana. Our guys haven’t defended the cases properly. Again, we are not going to win. The judgment has been written and I believe it should come out soon.
Nirupama Subramanian: Do you expect it to become the main issue in the election campaign?
Well, I will certainly make it one. I am sure all will make it a campaign issue. But Kejriwal has no legs to stand on. He says different things in different places. But yes, the Akalis will make it an issue . It is crucial for us. If you stop 10 lakh acres from getting canal water, how will people exist? Forget about farming, they won’t be able to live. Where will they drink water from?"

(Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri)
Pakistani High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit said Monday that it was “unfortunate” that a narrative had been formed in India that his country was trying to spread terror from across the border.
A narrative has been formed that “Pakistan ek dehshatgarda mulq hai, woh dehshat ko support karta hai aur India ko destablise karta hai (Pakistan is a sponsor of terror trying to destabilise India)”, said Basit, claiming that no other country had suffered due to terrorism like Pakistan. He was in Lucknow to attend an event organised by news portal Patrika.com of Rajasthan Patrika Group.

He emphasised on looking at reasons behind the strained ties, including terrorism and Kashmir, while focusing on confidence building measures. He was quick to point out a different narrative in Pakistan about terror. “Humein bhi mehsoos hota hai ki dehshatgardi ke jo waqye hote hain to unke peechhe foreign forces hain (We also feel that there are foreign forces behind incidents of terror).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On the Uri attack , Basit said that without much probe Pakistan was blamed for everything by the media.
“Jabse Delhi mein aaya ek narrative hai ki deshshatgardi ki wajah se taluquat sahi nahi hain. Ek had tak sahi hai (From the time I have come here, there is a narrative that terrorism is to blame for our bad relations. This is only true to some extent),” said Basit.
Citing the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration, he said that both countries believe that for the purpose of peace, the Kashmir issue should be resolved."

Tendulkar claimed this would be the first public speech by the Defence Minister post the surgical strike. “We are proud of his achievements and hence we want to express our sentiments to him,” he said. On Tuesday afternoon, Parrikar will arrive at the Dabolim airport from where he would be taken in a procession to Azad Maidan.

To a question, Tendulkar said the surgical strike will be one of the issues that would be highlighted during the Goa Assembly elections due next year. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that sacrifices in Uri attack would not go in vain and he has kept the word.

Only BJP and its government have the capability to take such stern action which is historic. We will be highlighting this achievement during the forthcoming poll campaign in Goa,” Tendulkar said.

America is “no longer a world power” and Pakistan would move towards China and Russia if its views on Kashmir and India are not considered, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s envoys have said here. “(The) US is no longer a world power. It is a declining power. Forget about it,” Special Kashmir Envoy of Sharif, Mushahid Hussain Syed was heard as saying Wednesday after the conclusion of an interaction at the Atlantic Council, one of the top American think-tanks.

Syed has gone to the extent to warn US that Pakistan would move towards China and Russia if its views on Kashmir and India are not considered.
He was apparently responding to a question from a member in the audience after the conclusion of the 90-minute interaction during which he expressed his frustration over the lack of response to his point of view on Kashmir and India.
The remarks of Syed were not recorded on camera, but was heard prominently by those inside the room.

Thereafter, he was quick to point out China and newly perceived relationship with Russia, which he had mentioned during his interaction at the Atlantic Council.
Syed submitted a dossier of alleged human rights violation in Kashmir to Special US Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Olson.
With no takers for Pakistan’s Kashmir policy, Syed said China is now an important factor in South Asia and described Beijing as part of what he termed as Greater South Asia.
“There has been slow and steady building of relationship between Moscow and Islamabad,” he said, referring to the joint military exercise between Pakistan and Russia.

Syed said the Putin government has for the first time agreed to sell arms to Pakistan and the US should take note of this changing regional alignment.
“Unfortunately under the Obama administration, there was a drift in American foreign policy towards our region, towards Afghanistan. There was confusion and there was a lot of flip-flops. I think, the Obama administration could not figure out this region Afghanistan and Pakistan and as a consequence this region suffered.
“With policies one step back and one step (forward), announcing surge, announcing a cut off time for exit. Asking sometime Pakistan that please we want to talk to the Taliban and then saying that we want to take on the Taliban and finally they said there would be no American troops and then they end up having 8,500 troops stationed in Afghanistan. It leaves this to the next administration,” he said."

Yami Gautam has experienced failures in her career but she never feared being written off. The actor says she will keep giving her best till the time she fulfills her dreams.
Yami made a successful debut with the National Award winning Vicky Donor in 2012, post which some of her projects except for Badlapur and Kaabil did not work at the box office.
“When the films didn’t work, I never feared being written off. I had other fears to deal with. What if I attend an event and the media asks me ‘so and so’s film did well, yours didn’t’, what will I say, how will I handle it. I was too vulnerable, sensitive,” Yami said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“I didn’t know how to be myself or be comfortable with the fact that it happens. You just have to accept it. I never bought my ticket to Mumbai, I earned it. I believe I was called for this and I won’t leave till I achieve my dreams,” she adds.

The actor believes when her movies don’t do well, it reflects in the kind of work coming her way.
“If your films don’t do well, the kind of films you’re offered, you’ve to choose from only that parameter. May be you’re capable of doing much more but at that point of time you’ve to make best decision out of what has been offered,” she adds.
Post the success of Vicky Donor, Yami was suddenly in the spotlight, but the actor says it took her time to adapt to the new life.
“I think adaptability is really important in the industry specially when you’re a newcomer and are not conditioned to this kind of setup. I was never the street-smart kind, I would never express myself so easily.”
The actor will be next seen in Batti Gul Meter Chalu directed by Shree Narayan Singh and produced by Bhushan Kumar. The film tells the story of electricity theft in rural India and will feature Yami as a lawyer.
The 29-year-old actor is happy that she is finally playing a different character, which does not have any Bollywood heroine cliches.
“What I’m doing here is something I haven’t done in any other film. I’ve realised it’s very dated to calculate your role or your screen presence. The impact of your role matters.”
Going forward, the actor also has Uri a film based on the Uri attacks co-starring Vicky Kaushal and Yami says her sense of picking up a film has evolved.
“It is important to be seen on screen but it matters on what content. Doing films for the heck of it is simple, easy too. Not that I haven’t made wrong choices but I stand by them. Patience has been one of my virtues, so I’ve always waited to do the things I want,” she said.
Batti Gul Meter Chalu, also starring Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor, is scheduled to release on September 21."

The ongoing animosity between India and Pakistan reached greater heights when MNS warned Pakistani actors working in India to go back to their motherland. This threat came in response to Uri attacks that claimed the lives of 19 soldiers of the Indian Army. While many actors openly condemned the attacks and lauded India for the surgical strike, others chose to remain silent. A few like Salman Khan backed Pakistani actors.
Meanwhile, people have been questioning the silence of the Pakistani artists. While Fawad Khan, Atif Aslam and a few chose to practice their right to remain silent, Mawra Hocane openly condemned the terror attacks.
” I strongly condemn all terror attacks We must realise that a life lost is a LIFE LOST!The world needs to stand together against terrorism!,” she wrote on Twitter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

I hope that you guys don’t get swept away with the bitterness and negativity, the violence that’s happening around the world and around us,” Ranbir Kapoor had said.
“I want you guys to stay sweet, gentle, amazing and beautiful. Because even though the world may think that it’s a shitty place to live in, it is beautiful. You guys are the force. And the force is going to be with you, forever,” the Roy actor added."

In what can be called the aftermath of Uri attack, a NDTV journalist Namrata Brar was asked to leave the press conference Pakistan Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry in New York. “Iss Indian ko nikalo (remove this Indian),” were the exact words used for her, she claims in a tweet.
“Told “Indian ko nikalo” at #Pakistan press con #UNGA #UriAttacks. Not surprised, we would probably do the same,” she tweeted.
Reportedly, not a single Indian was allowed to attend the briefing that was organised on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The press briefing was organised by Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As soon as the news broke on social media, ‘Is Indian Ko Nikalo’ started trending on Twitter and while some are angry at the behaviour handed out to the Indian journalist, many are mocking the situation. “Pakistani Official Said “Iss Indian Ko Nikalo” to NDTV Journalist.

During the attack, 18 soldiers were killed at an army base in Uri but Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has avoided questions on the same at the UN meet so far.

A day after India announced it will not attend the 19th SAARC summit in Islamabad in November, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan have conveyed to Nepal, the chair of SAARC, that they too will not be able to attend the summit.
All three countries, in different ways, blamed Pakistan for the current atmosphere and said it was not conducive for the summit. A formal announcement of the summit postponement will be made in Kathmandu in the next few days, since key government interlocutors in Nepal are not present in Kathmandu.

In a statement, the Nepal Foreign Ministry said: “The government of Nepal has received communications from the SAARC secretariat transmitting the diplomatic notes from four SAARC member states namely, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India in which they have conveyed their inability to participate in the 19th SAARC summit scheduled for November 9 and 10 in Islamabad, stating that the current regional environment is not conducive to the successful holding of the summit.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We have taken this development seriously. As the current chair of SAARC, the government of Nepal strongly urges that a conducive environment be created for the 19th SAARC summit soon by ensuring the participation of all member states in line with the spirit of the SAARC charter,” the Ministry stated.
In its letter to the SAARC secretariat, Bangladesh said, “The growing interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country has created an environment which is not conducive to the successful hosting of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016.”
“Bangladesh, as initiator of the SAARC process, remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in a more congenial atmosphere. In view of the above, Bangladesh is unable to participate in the proposed Summit in Islamabad.”
Pakistan has been critical of the war crimes trial in Bangladesh, initiated by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and has repeatedly criticised Dhaka for the hanging of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders. In fact, Bangladesh did not send its Home Minister for the SAARC Interior Ministers’ meeting in Islamabad last month, which was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
Bangladesh government sources told The Indian Express that Hasina, who is likely to visit Goa next month for the BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach summit, would have skipped the SAARC summit in Islamabad, and was planning to send the Bangladesh President instead.
However, the turn of events in Kashmir and then, Uri, led Delhi to exchange notes with Dhaka through diplomatic channels before the decision to boycott the SAARC summit was taken.
Afghanistan also conveyed to the SAARC chair that “due to increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, the President of Afghanistan Mohammad Ashraf Ghani with his responsibilities as the Commander in Chief will be fully engaged, and will not be able to attend the Summit.”
Kabul’s use of phrase “imposed terrorism on Afghanistan” is the result of its increasing frustration with Islamabad. Ghani, who visited India early September and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had conveyed his disappointment with Pakistan’s establishment, especially after the talks with Taliban did not make progress.
Following the Uri attack, when Ghani called Modi to convey his condolences, he also indicated his support to India for its actions against terrorism. This was a strong signal of unequivocal support from Kabul to Delhi. Thereafter, Afghan diplomats and South Block also exchanged notes.
Bhutan, which was not directly affected by the terrorist attacks from Pakistan-based groups, conveyed its inability to attend the summit, since it wanted to show its solidarity with South Block.
While reaffirming Bhutan’s strong commitment to the SAARC process and strengthening of regional cooperation, Thimphu’s missive to Nepal notes “the concern of the Royal Government of Bhutan on the recent escalation of terrorism in the region, which has seriously compromised the environment for the successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016”.
Further, its said, “the Royal Government of Bhutan shares the concerns of some of the member countries of SAARC on the deterioration of regional peace and security due to terrorism and joins them in conveying our inability to participate in the SAARC Summit, under the current circumstances.”
Sources privy to the decision-making process said there was “intense engagement with all three Capitals, and our top diplomats were engaged in a dialogue with their counterparts”, before all four countries decided to convey their decision to the SAARC chair, Nepal.
India’s announcement was made by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday which said “increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of member states by one country have created an environment that is not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad”. MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup had also tweeted: “Regional cooperation and terror don’t go together.”
This is the first time four countries will boycott a SAARC summit, and boycott of a SAARC summit by any head of government means that the summit has to be postponed."

The Jay Jawan Nagrik Samiti (JJNS), an NGO in Surat, will honour and give financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh each to the family members of the soldiers who were killed in violent clashes with Chinese troops in Galwan valley of Ladakh.
Managing trustee of the NGO Kanji Bhalara said, “Even during Uri attack, we reached out to the family members of those 42 soldiers who were killed and had given them Rs 2 lakh each. This year we are going to give Rs 1 lakh each to the families of 20 soldiers who died in the clashes in Galwan valley. We will felicitate them and also transfer the amount into the bank accounts of their families. We are also planning to take some of the school students while going to meet them, as many students in Varachha had also donated funds for the samiti, which they saved from their pocket money.”
“Through local district police headquarters and some of our links in the Army, we have got address and contact number of the families of the soldiers. We are also hoping to increase the financial assistance to around Rs 2 lakh,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The first such program organised by the JJNS was in 1999 on the day of Kargil Vijay Divas, when they felicitated and gave financial aid of Rs 2 lakh to the family members of 14 soldiers from Gujarat who were killed. The JJNS had collected funds from the diamond, textile and real estate businessmen of Surat.
“This year also we will give Rs 2 lakh each to the family members of 14 soldiers from Gujarat who were killed in attacks, those died in accident or due to illnesses. We will hand over the amount to them by the end of July,” Bhalara said."

(Source: PTI)
Hitting out at Islamabad in wake of the terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, where 17 soldiers of the Indian Army were martyred, Shaukat Kashmiri, the chairman of United Kashmir People’s National Party (UKPNP) on Sunday said that the Pakistan Government is very weak and has no writ, adding in the name of terrorism army operations are being conducted in some selected areas against those who raise their voice for the change of system there. On the Kashmir issue, Kashmiri said that religious motivated extremist groups are funded and supported by Pakistan.
“You can say that for the past 30 years there is a proxy war inside Kashmir and those religious motivated extremist groups are present are funded and supported by Pakistan. They keep doing something or the other. Sometimes they target civilians, army, police and scholars,” Kashmiri told ANI. He also pointed that on one hand, Pakistan talks about fighting a war against terrorism but then they attack the people in Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan.
“On one side they say that they are fighting a war against terrorism and there are few areas in FATA where they are using airstrikes. On the other hand in Balochistan they are using helicopters, guns and long range weapons against the Baloch fighters,” he said. Lambasting Pakistan, he highlighted that the Pakistani representative to the United Nations is glorifying Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani at the floor of the UN and presenting him as a great freedom fighter in the floor of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He pointed out that the purpose of Hurriyat is not to let peace prevail in the region. “See that whenever the civilian government of Pakistan and India agree for peaceful agreement and major confidence building working group is being formed and then such situation is being created and is done in purpose by the Hurriyat. Their agenda is to not let peace take place,” he added.
Kashmiri was of the opinion that peace is being targeted and he fears that India and Pakistan are standing at the doors of war. He, however, quoted Pakistan’s scholars and retired army officials that Pakistan has initiated all the wars against India.

“Pakistan has always carried out adventures be it Kargil. Even if we talk about wars than then Pakistan’s scholars and retired Air Marshal Asghar Khan in his interview said that four wars against India was initiated by them. This is no more a secret. Pakistan’s Nazir Naji, Ajam Sethi, Hamid Mir are finding that how Kashmiris have been fuelled into war,” he added.
He also maintained Taliban and terrorists have infrastructure in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). “Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin with its troops are raising the slogans of jihad ‘holy war’ in Muzaffarabad. Every day people are being motivated and the people who do not agree to their opinion are being kidnapped and killed,” he added."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to go for the event that is scheduled to take place in November this year.
“Well, I mean, clearly we’ve talked about that before is, while we’ve seen Pakistan make progress on some of the terrorist groups operating within its own borders and carrying out attacks within its borders, that we continue to put pressure on Pakistan to respond to those groups who are, quote/unquote, ‘seeking safe haven on Pakistan’s borders’, that — who are intent on carrying out attacks elsewhere in the region,” US State Department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner said in the daily press briefing on Tuesday.

India has launched a diplomatic blitzkrieg after the Uri attack that claimed the lives of 18 soldiers with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj saying at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly that the world should isolate nations that harbour terrorists.
New Delhi has blamed the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror outfit for the early morning attack.
On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar summoned Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit and made a demarche that proved Islamabad’s links to the Uri attack.
Modi has said that India would revisit the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty that calls for sharing of the waters of the six rivers of the Indus basin with Pakistan while indicating that the most favoured nation (MFN) trade status granted to the neighbour in 1996 might be revoked.
In his briefing, Toner said: “We want to see closer relations and a normalisation of relations, frankly, between India and Pakistan.”
“It would be the — to the benefit of the region. And we want to see de-escalation in the political discourse between the two countries and greater communication and coordination between them,” he said.
The US is one of the nine observers of Saarc, the others being Australia, China, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Myanmar and South Korea.
According to sources, Bangladesh too has conveyed that it will not attend the Islamabad event due to interferences in its internal affairs “by one country”.
Afghanistan and Bhutan have also voiced reservations about attending the summit while Sri Lanka has said that the event would not be possible without India’s participation."

The Supreme Court has permitted activist Madhu Kishwar, against whom a criminal defamation case has been filed by a Kashmir-based scribe, to participate in court proceedings at Srinagar through video-conferencing from a Delhi court. The apex court said if video-conferencing facility was not available in the Srinagar district court where the matter is pending, then the proceedings may take place at any appropriate place or court as per direction of the Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court.
It, however, clarified that it would be open to the trial court to make any appropriate modification in this arrangement to ensure that trial is not delayed. “We direct that Madhu Kishwar may be permitted to participate in the proceedings by video-conferencing from a Delhi court. If video-conferencing facility is not available in the district court in question then the proceedings may take place at any appropriate nearest place or court as per the direction of the Chief Justice of the High Court,” a bench comprising Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said.
The apex court said, “This order will be subject to the proceedings not being obstructed in any manner”. Kishwar, through her counsel and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, had approached the apex court challenging the May 24 order of high court dismissing her plea seeking transfer of the criminal defamation complaint against her from a court in Srinagar to Jammu. Jethmalani had told the top court that the high court had failed to appreciate the “explosive and life-threatening law and order situation” in Srinagar and the risk it would pose to her life.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She had claimed that on the basis of a “few tweets” posted by her on her Twitter handle regarding the state of the media in Kashmir, a complaint was filed by Syed Shujaat Bukhari, the Editor-in-Chief of a daily published from Srinagar, alleging that these tweets were defamatory. She had claimed that the apex court should consider the “continuing surcharged atmosphere in the Kashmir Valley, where even policemen are being lynched and security forces face murderous attacks every day”.
“Despite Z Plus security cover enjoyed by the chief minister of J&K, she had to plead with the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone the by-election in her father’s constituency because she did not feel safe campaigning in her home constituency for her brother who had filed his nomination from there,” the plea had claimed.
In her plea, she had also spoken about the law and order situation in the Valley following the shooting down of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an encounter.
“Shops and offices remained closed, students sat at home and businesses collapsed. The raging fire was further fuelled by the Uri attack, followed by India’s ‘surgical strike’ in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir leading to a war-like situation in border areas,” her plea alleged."

The year 2016 has been a memorable one for reasons good and bad. This is the year when some of the most unexpected incidents left people in a state of shock. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, an iconic figure, passed away. Old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are no longer valid. Business Tycoon Donald Trump is the president of the United States. Pakistani artists were threatened to leave the country. Students were deemed ‘anti-national’ for sloganeering. And playing of National Anthem is now mandatory in all the movie theatres across the country.
The year was full of surprises and while there were very serious stories with consequences that affected common public, there were some that amused them. We saw a Punjabi aunty who won the Internet with her ‘badassery’ because she asked the man who had come to rob her shop to wait till she finished her tea. We also saw a Bengaluru businessman’s daughter’s wedding card which had an LCD screen and how can you forget actor Rakhi Sawant’s dress with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photos all over it.

Mining baron and former BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy’s daughter’s wedding was actually a Twitter and Facebook trend because it had a LCD screen! In one of a kind card, loud wedding music begins flashing “Bramhani Weds Rajeev Reddy”. What follows is a 2-minute performance by the family, wherein Reddy sings songs (or lip-syncs) with his wife and son in and around a huge mansion, worshipping gods and goddesses, and showering flowers in gorgeously set-up surroundings.

After the Uri attacks, which claimed the lives of at least 19 soldiers and the injured many civilians in Jammu and Kashmir, there has been a constant state of unrest across India. This is despite the momentary euphoria that followed the Indian Army’s surgical strikes that were conducted along the LoC, in response to the brutal attack.
Social media platforms were bombarded with messages of hate as well as those of love and peace in equal amounts, and from people from both countries.

Though the relationship between the two countries have been on tenterhooks since Independence, recent incidents have only led to further strain. In India, MNS (Maharashtra Navnirmana Sena) has called for a ban on Pakistani actors. Many have seconded the party’s decision, while many others in the industry and outside have supported the Pakistani artistes and questioned the MNS boycott. Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt have both spoken openly in support of Pakistani actors working in India.

While people are divided over the ban of the artistes, more and more former Army men are coming forth with their perspective on the state of affairs – both political and military. One such voice is of Major Gaurav Arya, who wrote an open letter on social media supporting the ban of the actors. “This conflict between India and Pakistan is not the soldier’s personal war. He is dying and killing for you and me. Imagine a situation in which the soldier felt, and behaved, like Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt? … How many of you would like it if a soldier felt that this was not his personal war”, he wrote.
See what else is making news.

Here’s the full text of his post.
“MALA FIDE INTENT

Our boys have just about returned from across the Line of Control after a very successful surgical strike. The entire nation is delirious with joy; the entire nation, except a few.

Today, I was part of a panel discussion in JNU, interestingly called “Intellectual Terrorism”. The term is self-explanatory, though wide-ranging. I will discuss one type of intellectual terrorism here. The proponents of this type of terror are to found in every walk of life, but the roots of this disease are embedded in some institutions of higher learning. More of that some other time.

Karan Johar wants to know if asking Fawad Khan to go back to Pakistan will stop terror. Mahesh Bhatt joins the chorus by saying “stop terrorism, not talks” implying that we must continue to talk to Pakistan. The cricket board will continue to play matches with Pakistan. Certain business houses will continue to do business with Pakistan. All this, while our soldiers are dying on the border.

Will sending Pakistani artists back, stopping cricket and business with Pakistan actually end terror from Pakistan? No, it most certainly will not. But there is an emotion called solidarity. You cannot make films, play cricket and do business as if everything is fine, because it is not. It makes the soldier wonder aloud, “Why should I alone bear the weight of conflict?”

This conflict between India and Pakistan is not the soldier’s personal war. He is dying and killing for you and me. Imagine a situation in which the soldier felt, and behaved, like Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt? Imagine if a soldier walked up to his superior and said, “Sir, while I am dying on the Line of Control, these people are going about as if everything is absolutely fine between the two countries.”

How many of you would like it if a soldier felt that this was not his personal war, and he, like Mahesh Bhatt, should walk across the Line of Control and shake hands with a Pakistani soldier? Why should he alone sacrifice for India, when others were making merry?

A soldier will die before the thinks of such treason, but it’s certainly food for thought, isn’t it?

Patriotism and sacrifice is not the sole responsibility of the soldier. India is Mahesh Bhatt’s country, as much as it is the soldier’s.

The United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980, and the Russians did likewise when they boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. This is what happens when national interest is held paramount. And this is what must happen now.

For 70 years, Pakistan has been killing Indian citizens. Are we so inured to the pain of our fellow brethren that making a movie or playing a cricket match takes precedence over a soldier’s mourning home?

18 families have been shattered like glass. Not a word for them by our Bollywood royalty, mind you. But the pain of Fawad Khan’s departure is too much to bear, it seems. A tweet in support of Pakistani artists is mandatory.

These directors and producers will have you believe that before Rahat Fateh Ali Khan sang for Bollywood, there was no music of significance in the Hindi film industry. The cricket board is so busy making money that a widow’s silent sob and an orphan’s scream does not matter. What actually matters are day and night matches between India and Pakistan. The most keenly contested sporting event in history, they say; even better than the Ashes.

And the soldiers? Well, as far as they are concerned, they are on another planet, far removed from the glitzy Bollywood studios, and the teak-paneled walls of the stately boardrooms of the BCCI. The blood, the mud, the screams and the exploding gunpowder are just distant and inconvenient, not very different from traffic during the Mumbai monsoons. Life must go on.

It’s easy to ask for peace when you are a thousand miles away from the Line of Control, and your primary concerns are which party to attend this evening and where to get financing for your next film.

Peace is not a punch line. It is the end result of war.

There is a 10-year-old girl, Aditi, who understands the nation and its ebbs and flows far better than Mahesh Bhatt and Karan Johar. See her letter attached. Then see the poster made by Mahesh Bhatt, which he so proudly displays.

I leave it to you to decide who speaks for you. My vote goes to Aditi. This little angel has the spirit of a soldier.

The three-day National Council meet of BJP began in Kozhikode on Friday with general secretaries, office bearers and key state leaders holding discussions to give final shape to a comprehensive pro-poor agenda of the party and the future strategy to deal with Pakistan in the wake of Uri terror attack.
BJP President Amit Shah is chairing the meeting attended by top party leaders from across the country.
Watch What Else is Making News

The leaders have insisted that their ideologue Deen Payal Upadhyay’s concept of ‘Antyodaya’ (uplift of the last man) will be key to their deliberations which will also touch on the Uri terror attack, that left 18 army men dead, the Kashmir unrest and other germane issues like state polls scheduled for next year and the GST.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The party is expected to articulate its ‘garib kalyan’ agenda to reach out to the mariginalised like Dalits and OBCs ahead of next year’s crucial state polls, including in Uttar Pradesh.
This is Upadhyay’s birth centenary year and his 100th birth anniversary falls on September 25.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also arrive here on Saturday and will address a public meeting, his first such address after the attack in Uri. He will address the party’s National Council on Sunday.
Party leaders and cadres expect him to speak on Uri attack as the saffron outfit has been under fire over repeated incidents of Pakistani terrorists targeting defence facilities, more so as Modi had often flayed the UPA government over its alleged soft attitude to Pakistan in the face of terror incidents.
The Uri attack has forced the party to recalibrate its agenda for the Council, likely to be attended by over 1,700 delegates, including all its chief ministers, all its union ministers and top brass from all states.
In its bid to woo the poor, dalits and marginalised sections in society, the BJP is of the view that effective implementation of the agenda can help it reach out to them, as it is facing flak over dalit issues from Opposition parties.
The party is likely to use the occasion to reprise the poor-centric ideology of Upadhyay, who was elected its president in 1967 at the same venue.
The party had earlier formed a committee under the leadership of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to prepare a ‘garib kalyan’ (welfare of poor) agenda under which its state governments will be asked to achieve certain key objectives in various welfare schemes.
Modi on September 25 will inaugurate Upadhyay’s birth centenary celebrations which will go on for over a year.
The party leadership is also expected to deliberate over assembly polls in several states scheduled for early next year, including in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. BJP has been out of power in Uttar Pradesh for over 14 years and Shah has claimed that it will make a come back with two-third majority by trouncing formidable regional rivals like Samajwadi Party and BSP.
The meet will also focus on increased cases of violence against BJP cadres and those of its ideological mentor RSS in Left-ruled Kerala. BJP leadership has blamed CPI(M) for these incidents."

Donning the army uniform for the thriller Uri was more than just slipping into a new character for actor Vicky Kaushal. In this interview, the actor reveals he undertook a personal, introspective journey while shooting for the Aditya Dhar directorial.
As a citizen, Vicky always had his own take on patriotism, but working on Uri made him see things in a new light.
“I always thought that it was more important to feel patriotic. But when you have to play an army guy, it is different from how we sit at home and feel patriotic. This is about action. It is because of our conditioning that we automatically respect our soldiers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“But for them, it is a job that they do. They are always on the trigger. They have to protect. Their outlook towards patriotism is so much more concentrated. They are so into it. They live patriotism,” the actor said.
Uri, which also stars Yami Gautam, Paresh Rawal and Kirti Kulhari, is based on the Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control, days after the Uri attack.
Vicky Kaushal said the team was aware that this project had to be dealt with a huge sense of responsibility because patriotic films in India are more of a sentiment than a cinema-viewing experience for the audience.
“The topic of patriotism is so relevant today. It is like we are defining what patriotism is. Is it about showing and expressing patriotism or about feeling it? In times like today where we are more vocal about patriotism, it was a huge task to tell this story and convey the message more responsibly. And hats off to Ronnie Screwvala to back this project and to Aditya Dhar for doing this,” he said.
Ruminating on his personal experience of playing an army officer, the actor said the best takeaway from Uri was the long late-night chats that he had with real-life army men while prepping for the film.

“What happened to me personally was something. My outlook towards the military has changed. I always had respect for them, but now portraying their life in such a personal way, it just gave me an opportunity to play so many different shades of their lives – their family life, their life at the war front, their training, and everything to do with them.
“It is when they (soldiers) start telling their stories, you realise how fascinating their stories are. I was all ears. I realised they are not normal beings. They are just something else. Their way of living, the way they follow etiquettes, their discipline, the way they respect women, it is outstanding. After talking to them, when I would come back home, I would be full of stories and would share my experiences with my family and it was all awe-inspiring,” Vicky Kaushal said.
There are still days left for Uri to arrive in theaters (January 11), but the army has already given the film a thumbs-up.
The actor shared, “We have shown our film to them. The biggest validation for us was that they told us that we have made the film with great authenticity. When military guys say that, it is something. These guys are very sentimental about the finer details about their life. And that eye for detail doesn’t come from an arrogant space, it comes from a very personal and sentimental space. They earn this.”"

Officials of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), probing Sunday’s terror attack on the Army camp in Uri which left 18 soldiers dead, believe that the terrorists spent at least a day in the mountains above the brigade headquarters complex, observing their target. The bulk of the fatalities, NIA sources told The Indian Express, took place in a cook-house and store room which burned down during the attack. The two buildings, sources said, had been bolted from outside to prevent those inside from escaping before being set on fire, suggesting that the terrorists had a high degree of knowledge about their targets.

 
Launching their attack from the western side of the complex, the four-man assault team first shot a sentry, before three headed towards tents where the soldiers were billeted, and the two buildings. The fourth terrorist moved towards the officers’ mess.
Investigation sources said their hopes of proving that the terrorists began their journey in Pakistan now rest on retrieving data from a damaged Global Positioning System (GPS) set recovered from the attack site.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) engineers have been tasked with attempting to recover data from the Garmin eTrex GPS set, one of two which the terrorists are believed to have used to guide them along their hike, cutting across the Haji Pir pass before reaching Uri.

The second GPS set, Army sources said, was too badly damaged during the fighting for data to be recovered.
Sources said the NIA had also taken DNA samples and fingerprints of the four terrorists before their bodies were buried Monday. “These will be preserved as evidence, and can be used to determine matches in future if necessary,” sources said.

Four Kalashnikov rifles used by the terrorists, and handed over by the military to investigators Monday, bore no markings or insignia of any kind, sources familiar with the ongoing investigation said. There were also no military markings on barrel-fired grenades destroyed by the Army Monday, or on launchers fitted on the Kalashnikovs.
Lt General Ranbir Singh, Director General of Military Operations, had told reporters Sunday that the weapons had Pakistan markings. NIA officials, however, underlined that syringes, painkillers, other medications and packets of ready-to-eat food carried by the terrorists bore the markings of several Pakistani manufacturers, linking the perpetrators to that country.

“All groups infiltrating from Pakistan carry this kind of kit,” an NIA official said, “so it doesn’t tell us anything very specific.”

The ICom-manufactured handset used by the terrorists, intelligence sources said, matched a device recovered from Bahadur Ali, a Pakistani national arrested in July. The device was used to communicate with the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s main control station, code-named Alpha3.
An NIA official said the fact that the Uri attackers used a similar set was not, in itself, conclusive evidence that the Lashkar carried out the strike. “ICom is a well-known manufacturer of high-trade tactical wireless equipment,” he said, “and its products are widely used, even by law enforcement.”
The NIA, the official said, would be seeking details from ICom on the set that was sold.
Responding to The Indian Express,  Alok Mittal, Inspector General and Official Spokesperson of the National Investigation Agency, has said the investigation into the attack on the Army camp in Uri is “only at a preliminary stage” and “conclusions attributed to the NIA investigation are false and misleading, and not supported by any investigational findings”.
“The movements of the terrorists inside the Army camp are still being verified and at this stage, it cannot be said to be the same as published in the newspaper. No seizure of any items including Kalashnikov rifles have been made by the NIA so far, and hence the presence or absence of markings on them have not been ascertained yet. Further, the process of taking over of the case properties are only underway, and have not been completed. The reference to the NIA’s conclusions on the GPS sets, and other case properties in this news report, are thus without basis,” Mittal said. He said the DG, NIA, has not yet visited the attack site at Uri, as was reported.
Referring to the same report, Colonel Abhijit Mitra, Director (Media), Integrated HQ of MoD (Army), said the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) had not claimed that weapons carried by the terrorists had Pakistani markings. He also said “the NIA does not have the mandate to investigate plans and conduct of Indian Army’s counter-terrorist operations. Its mandate, if any, under such circumstances, is to collect, collate and analyse forensic evidence to determine identity of terrorists, collaborators and sponsors, as applicable”.
The Indian Express replies:
The DGMO’s formal statement on the Uri attack made no reference to markings being found on the weapons carried by the terrorists. However, at least nine national television, print and news agencies including Doordarshan, reported the DGMO as saying that the weapons bore Pakistani markings. These reports were never denied until The Indian Express reported it.
Though it calls the report “false and misleading”, the NIA has not denied any of the three statements of fact. Like the Army, the NIA has not denied that no Pakistani markings have been found on the four weapons seized from the Uri attackers. It has said “the process of taking over of the case properties are only underway, and have not been completed”.
The NIA does not deny that a number of Army personnel died of asphyxiation in buildings bolted from the outside. The NIA denies it has possession of a GPS set found at the site. The report, however, stated that the GPS set was with the NTRO, a different organisation.
The report erroneously stated that the Director General of NIA, Sharad Kumar, had visited Uri. The error is regretted."

(Source: File/Reuters)
Terming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent speech attacking Pakistan as a violation of the UN norms on non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Pakistan’s top diplomat said such “irresponsible” behaviour at the highest level was regrettable. Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry said that Modi’s statement shows India’s nervousness over the situation in Kashmir.
Chaudhry said that it was unfortunate that the Indian leadership “continues to indulge in a vilification campaign against Pakistan by making provocative statements and hurling baseless accusations”. He said that such “display of irresponsible behaviour at the highest political level was regrettable”, Dawn reported. “It is evident that, as an act of desperation”, India is trying to distract the world attention from the “atrocities perpetrated by its forces against innocent and defenceless Kashmiris, including women and children”, Chaudhry said.
Indian Prime Minister’s recent statement violates all United Nations and international charters on non-interference in internal affairs of other countries, he said. The Foreign Secretary noted that “Indian atrocities had intensified since the extrajudicial killing of Kashmiri youth leader Burhan Muzaffar Wani in July”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Over the last 75 days, Indian occupation forces have martyred more than 100 Kashmiris, blinded hundreds and injured thousands.” The foreign secretary said that while casting aspersions on Pakistan, India continued to “sponsor terrorism in Pakistan directly through its state apparatus”. The arrest and confessional statement of a serving Indian navy officer and intelligence operative, Kulbhushan Jadhav, had proved India’s involvement, he claimed.

There are increasing demands for independent investigations and fact-finding missions to be sent to Kashmir, he said. Prime Minister Modi launched a blistering attack on Pakistan on Saturday in his first public address after last Sunday’s deadly Uri terror attack. Modi said the sacrifice of 18 soldiers will not go in vain while all out efforts will be made to isolate Pakistan globally.
“Terrorists should hear out clearly that India will never forget the Uri attack…I want to tell the leadership of Pakistan that the sacrifice of our 18 jawans will not go in vain,” Modi told a public meeting on the Kozhikode beach held on the sidelines of the BJP national council meet."

His third film Ae Dil hai Mushkil will release during Diwali.
If you thought Fawad Khan’s professional life was suffering due to the entire MNS controversy, and that he had to fly back to Pakistan out of no choice, here is a correction. India’s ban on Pakistani artistes is definitely one of the reasons. But there is more that’s happening in Fawad’s life. The Pakistani actor has become a proud father again. His wife Sadaf delivered a baby girl late on Tuesday. Fawad’s manager Hassan Khalid personally confirmed the news to the Pakistani media and said, “The actor was with his wife at the time of delivery and both mother and child are healthy.”
Fawad has made a mark on both sides of the border with his acting skills. It didn’t take much time for the Pakistani heartthrob to win over the Indian audience too, thanks to his perfectly planned Bollywood debut in 2014 film Khoobsurat opposite Sonam Kapoor. This came almost at the same time when his blockbuster show Humsafar was already winning hearts on Zindagi channel in India. Fawad went on to deliver his second Bollywood blockbuster Kapoor & Sons this year. We are already awaiting his third film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, even though he will appear in a cameo.

 
Everything was running perfectly smooth for Fawad until the recent Uri attack and the MNS announced ban on Pakistani artistes in India in the aftermath of the latest tensions. While Fawad left for Pakistan, many said he has reportedly been dropped as the first guest on the fifth season of Koffee With Karan. But amid all this, some sources even kept stating that it was also because Fawad wished to be with his wife Sadaf who was scheduled to deliver around the same time. And Pakistani magazine shared the news on its official Instagram handle too.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
	
	
		
			
 
Fawad married his childhood sweetheart Sadaf in November 2005. The couple already has a six-year-old son Ayaan. Fawad, who has always come across as a family man, keeps sharing his personal pictures with both Sadaf and Ayaan on his official social media handles. And we are sure it won’t take Fawad much time to reveal the picture of his new-born angel too.

The play praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his resolve to “flush out” terrorism.
Watch What Else is Making news


The act — organised by the Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Department on the barricaded streets of Wadi area in Vadodara — was part of a series of performances showcasing the culture of Gujarat.Scheduled as the last act of the evening, the chapter of surgical strikes began with famous song Sandese Aate Hain from the movie Border, with actors portraying Army officers at a camp remembering their families.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Halfway through the song, in a dramatic reconstruction of the Uri attack, bearded “militants” in black pathanis, sporting keffiyeh (arab checkered scarf) and wielding AK-47s “kill” several soldiers at the Army camp. The act then introduced a character dressed as the Prime Minister, lip-syncing one of his speeches.
With an accompanying announcement that the speech was delivered six days after the “big attack on India”, the original audio of Modi’s speech was played. “Hamare 18 jawano ka balidan bekar nahi jayega… Atankwad ke saamne na hindustan kabhi jhuka hai, na jhukega. Atankwad ko khatam karke hi rahega… ye desh bhoolne wala nahi hai, hamare 18 jawano ko… atankwadi kaan khol ke sun lein, ye desh is baat ko bhoolne wala nahi hai… (The sacrifice of our 18 soldiers will not go in vain… India has never bowed down to terrorism, nor will it bow down ever. It will destroy terrorism. This country will not forget the 18 jawans. Terrorists must hear carefully, this country will not forget this incident),” the PM had said in the speech.
The speech was followed by a video playing on a large LED screen of Army helicopters air-dropping Army jawans to secret locations. On the stage, men dressed as Army officials reappeared, clinically executing the hiding terrorists as audience cheered.
The play then ended with an instrumental theme of Saare Jahan Se Accha and chants of Har Har Mahadev, with the jubilant “Army officers” dancing to Bajirao Mastani song Malhaari. A cutout of India’s map and Bharat Mata, along with photographs of the soldiers killed in the Uri attack, was in the backdrop.
The act also included a song for communal harmony — Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, besides chants of Bharat Mata ki Jai at the end.
Among the audience, apart from curious bystanders were local BJP leaders and elected representatives. Minister of State for Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Rajendra Trivedi said, “The festival of Diwali has begun and Wadi area is aware of Gujarat’s pride and this programme is symbolic of that. There is a series of acts showing the progress of Gujarat, and at the end there is an act on surgical strikes. This act is a warning to anti-nationals and traitors as well as rival nations and terrorists.”"

(Source: Subramanya Prasad/YouTube)
On September 18, 2016 the whole of India was shaken by the news of 17 soldiers of the Indian Army being martyred in the Uri fidayeen attack. About 19 other security personnel were injured in the attack by a suicide squad from Pakistan. The country and the rest of the world erupted with reactions, many angry, many hurt by the unrequited bloodshed of the innocent.
But, this video of an Indian soldier singing a popular patriotic poem, is winning over the Internet. The video shows a soldier in a bus giving an extremely enthusiastic message and is accompanied by others in uniform. He sings ‘Kashmir to hoga, lekin pakistan nahi hoga‘ — a poem made popular by Sadhvi Balika Saraswati, young leader and star speaker of the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad). It is not clear if the video was shot after the attack, but the file has been posted on YouTube after the incident.
One of the lines in the poem goes: ‘Siyar bhediye se dar sakti singhon ki aulad nahi, bharat vansh k is paani ki hai tumko pehchan nahi‘, which literally translates to ‘the children of lions will not be afraid of the wolves, you do not know the waters that flow through our country.’ The strong words in the poem are obviously aimed at Pakistan and its inclination towards violence.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The soldier continues to recite with fervour: ‘Pakistan ye kan khol kar sun le, abki jung chidi to sun le, naam nishan nahi hoga, Kashmir to hoga lekin pakistan nahi hoga!’ He is challenging the miscreants in the neighbouring country that another cowardly attempt at creating unrest here, will prove worse for them. He further says, nothing will happen to Kashmir, but that will not be the case with Pakistan.
Watch the video of the soldier reciting the poem here.

India and Pakistan’s fight over Kashmir has been going on since independence and has only intensified with passing time. The Uri attack is only the latest to a series of troubles between the two countries over Kashmir."

(File photo)
With the promise of ushering in a “Naya Pakistan”, Prime Minister Imran Khan padded up on August 18 last year to face a barrage of issues, including critical economic challenges, threats to internal security, rising extremism, worsening ties with the US and soured ties with India. One year on, Khan, unlike his illustrious cricketing career, seems to have failed to get off to a cracking start, with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf government being saddled with dwindling foreign exchange reserves, low exports, high inflation and growing fiscal deficit.
Immediately after PTI sailed smoothly to a simple majority in the Pakistan general elections, following a 22-year-struggle in the political arena, Khan extended an olive branch to New Delhi, saying, “If India takes one step towards us, we will take two steps toward them.” However, in reality, relations between the two nations have taken two steps backwards following the Pulwama attacks, Kulbhushan Jadhav case and a fresh flashpoint over scrapping of the special status of Kashmir. Measures like the opening of the Kartarpur corridor and crackdown on terrorist groups, including Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and 26/11 mastermind Hafeez Saeed, has been a positive development.

Besides, the Imran Khan government has also faced accusations of muzzling the voice of the Opposition. Two former prime ministers — Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — are behind the bars while two others — Yousuf Raza Gilani and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf — are charged in corruption cases in the Accountability Court. Former president Asif Ali Zardari is also facing investigation in a fake accounts case.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
For the Interior Ministry, the toughest challenge was posed by the Tehrik-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which held violent protests across the country, following the acquittal of Asia Bibi on October 31 last year in a blasphemy case.
The fact that Imran Khan has struggled in his first year as PM can be gauged from the fact that his government has come good on only one of the 49 major promises made in his 2018 election manifesto, according to Dawn. While the government has kept its promise of building a Special Task Force to recover looted national wealth parked in offshore tax havens, other pledges like a Medina-style welfare state in which education and health will get maximum priority, 10 million jobs and five million low-cost homes are yet to be implemented.
1) Soured relations with India
Already on a downslide following the Pulwama attack, where a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber killed 40 CRPF personnel, relations between India and Pakistan worsened after Imran Khan decided to downgrade diplomatic ties with New Delhi, recall its high commissioner and suspend bilateral trade in response to the Narendra Modi government’s move to scrap special status to Jammu and Kashmir by diluting Article 370.

The development came nearly five months after India decided to revoke the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status that it had accorded to Pakistan in 1996. The India-Pakistan official bilateral trade is currently worth about $2 billion. According to a recent report by ICRIER, it peaked to about $ 2.5 billion but fell again after the Uri attack, and has dipped again due to the 200 per cent duty imposed by India on imports from Pakistan after the Pulwama attack.
The terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in February was the latest flashpoint with India launching an airstrike in Balakot inside Pakistan. Pakistan retaliated by launching airstrikes and targeting military installations along the LoC, which was followed by a dogfight where IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by Pakistan. After several days of uncertainty, the tension finally eased when Pakistan returned Varthaman to India as a goodwill gesture.
However, the prospects for the resumption of engagement between the two nations looked promising after Prime Minister Narendra Modi secured a second term on the back of a thumping win in the Lok Sabha elections. In fact, even before the elections began, Khan also batted for a second-term for BJP, saying “there may be a better chance of peace talks with India if the incumbent government is back”.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5577657 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg"" alt=""Pak PM Imran Khan trolled for sitting while other leaders stand at SCO summit in Bishkek"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/imran-khan-759.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> Just two months after Imran Khan assumed charge, the Trump administration had cut $300 million in military aid to Pakistan in September 2018.
After Modi’s election win, Khan had dialled the PM and said he looked forward to advancing his vision for “peace, progress and prosperity”. In response, Modi had said that “creating trust and an environment free of violence and terrorism were essential” for cooperation in fostering “peace, progress and prosperity” in the region.
In between, the protracted legal battle over Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Navy officer sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage, at the International Court of Justice also soured ties. The ICJ’s verdict, granting consular access to Jadhav and directing Islamabad to review and reconsider his conviction and sentencing, was perceived as a major diplomatic success for India.
2) Crackdown on terror and arrest of Hafeez Saeed
On July 26, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said at the United States Institute of Peace that there were “30,000 to 40,000 armed people” in his country “who have been trained to fight in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir”. The interesting fact about it was that for the first time a Pakistani Prime Minister spoke about it candidly.

While in his first year Imran Khan has launched a series of crackdowns against terrorists and terror groups operating within Pakistan, India has said it was just to “hoodwink the international community” by taking “cosmetic steps against such outfits”. In the immediate aftermath of the Pulwama attack, 44 people linked to several militant groups were taken into preventive custody. They included two close relatives of Masood Azhar — Mufti Abdur Rauf and Hammad Azhar.
Three months later, with pressure from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which last year placed Pakistan on its “grey list” of countries with inadequate controls on terrorism financing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed was arrested. Pakistan also lodged 23 cases against Saeed and 12 aides for using five trusts to collect funds and donations for Lashkar-e-Taiba.
3) Economic woes fester
Internally, Imran Khan’s biggest headache in the maiden year of his government has been on the economic front. From petroleum products to food items and from bills for electricity and gas to medicine, prices have everything has skyrocketed amid rising inflation while the government has been unable to attract any foreign investment and also failed in creating business opportunities within the country.

Over the last year, the growth rate has halved — down to 3.3 per cent, the lowest in nine years and foreign exchange reserves fell to such a level at one point that the government was grappling to cover a month’s worth of imports, according to a report in Dawn.
The extent of the crisis could be gauged from the fact that the PTI government borrowed $16 billion in just one year – the highest ever external borrowing in any fiscal year since its independence in 1947. Imran Khan himself visited Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, primarily to seek money to bail out Pakistan’s economy as the government’s external debt increased to $65.8 billion in January 2019. Rising imports under the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects and low exports has led to a rise of its current account deficit from $2.7 billion in 2015 to $18.2 billion in 2019.
According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report, Pakistan ranks 136th out of 190 economies. Besides, Pakistan has not been able to attract consistent foreign direct investment in this one year. The only bright spot was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, pledging $21 billion investment over the next six years. Recently, Pakistan has also managed to secure a $6 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan.

“In this one year, the government has managed to decrease current account deficit and trade deficit, made saving through its austerity drive, introduced flagship programmes in the social sector and restored the lost dignity of Pakistani leadership.”
“In this one year, the government has managed to decrease current account deficit and trade deficit, made saving through its austerity drive, introduced flagship programmes in social sector and restored the lost dignity of Pakistani leadership,” Dawn quoted Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Affairs Naeem ul Haq as saying in a ceremony on the completion of one year of Imran Khan government.
4) Balancing the US and Afghanistan
Just two months after Imran Khan assumed charge, the Trump administration had cut $300 million in military aid to Pakistan in September 2018. Ties between the two nations went further south after the US President, in his New Year tweet, accused Islamabad of being a “liar”. “They (Pakistan) give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help,” Trump tweeted.

However, since then, ties between the two countries seem to be back on track after Pakistan brought the Taliban to the negotiating table, with Trump thanking Imran Khan for “helping out” with the Afghan talks. This is so because the US is keen to withdraw US troops from the country to save the $45 billion it spends there annually. Besides, the Pentagon also approved military sales worth $125 million to Pakistan.
The most recent round of talks between Taliban and US special representative Zalmay Khalilzad was held in early July in Doha, Qatar. Khalilzad has called it the “most productive of the seven rounds” so far. Pakistan’s role in being the main force behind the Taliban participation and driving the peace process in Afghanistan has been appreciated by all sides."

BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday said India should launch “surgical bombardment” on terrorist training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to retaliate against the attack on the Army base in Uri.
Swamy, who met Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar earlier in the day, said the terror attack and the killing of jawans at “Pakistan’s behest” represents a paradigm change in the “reckless disregard and audacity” of Pakistan which requires a “sharp retaliatory response” most urgently.
He told Parrikar that a “surgical bombardment” of terrorist training camps in PoK is one such step and essential to meet Indian people’s expectation from a strong government for which the people had voted in 2014, a statement by Swamy said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also sought immediate withdrawal of unilateral most-favoured nation (MFN) status given to Pakistan for trade.
Swamy said Pakistan’s embassy should be immediately downgraded and the ambassador be sent back.
He also suggested that China and Israel should be taken into confidence and persuaded to support India’s retaliatory actions against Pakistan.
Heavily armed militants suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM had yesterday stormed an Army base in Uri in Kashmir, killing 18 jawans."

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today expressed her apprehensions over calling an all-party meeting on the Uri terror attack. “I do not think it will solve the problem,” she said when asked about whether the Central government should call an all-party meet to discuss the situation in wake of the terror attack. “I have some questions in my mind like you. But it is better to keep quiet in the interest of the country,” she said, adding that it was not the right time to discuss all these things.
“It was very unfortunate. It is the matter of my country and I will not say anything which will hurt the interests of our country,” the CM said. Earlier during the day, Banerjee in a tweet condemned the terrorist attack on the Army base at Uri in Kashmir in which 18 soldiers were killed yesterday.

In one of the deadliest attacks on the Army in recent years, 18 jawans were killed and 18 others injured as heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based Jaish-e- Mohammed, stormed a battalion headquarters of the force in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours yesterday."

Someone in Maharashtra Navnirman Sena is a big fan of Abhijeet Bhattacharya. Two days after the singer – in his usual take-no-prisoners, spout-out-as-much-hate-as-you-can style – asked Karan Johar, the Khans, the government, MNS… or whoever was listening to drive out Pakistani actors from India, he had his wish fulfilled.
On Friday, MNS’ Chitrapat Sena issued a “direct threat” – all the Pakistani actors should leave India within 48 hours. And while they were at it, they said they will not allow any Bollywood films to release which have Pakistani faces in it. The ‘direct threat’ was against two specific films – Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees.
WATCH VIDEO: What Fawad Khan Has to Say About India And Its Hospitality Months Back 

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Both Abhijeet and MNS have history. If Abhijeet and his trolling have shown him the insides of a police station – obviously in vain, MNS has attacked the very same people before. In 2008, Karan Johar’s Wake Up Sid (also starring Ranbir Kapoor, déjà vu anybody?) was targeted by MNS for calling Mumbai, Bombay. Before MNS could vandalise theatres screening Wake Up Sid, Mumbai was beeped out from the film.
Karan may have thought that was it. But that’s the thing about giving in to bullies, they acquire a taste for it. In 2010, the MNS hooligans were back and the same fate awaited Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar’s My Name Is Khan. The issue at stake was Shah Rukh’s Kolkata Knight Riders having Pakistani players in its ranks. Bollywood didn’t bow and MNS did its thing, but the film still released.
Ghulam Ali was not so lucky. The Pakistani ghazal maestro’s concerts were cancelled in Mumbai and Pune in 2015 after more such “direct threats” from MNS and Shiv Sena. What MNS loses out in terms of its presence in legislature and Parliament, it makes up by its sheer nuisance value.
Its diktats would keep on coming; the question is how long Bollywood – the perfect soft target – would be expected to follow them?
After the Uri attack, the emotions are all roiled up and India’s pacifist stand is under attack. But MNS’ stand is more of a political posturing than anything else. Bollywood and cricket is a high-return investment – attack it and you will get media coverage in not just India but across globe. Add in Pakistan bashing and it stops being pure news too, it is about patriotism and emotions. Who will dare question that?
Throw their artistes out, play no more cricket – the same circle has been repeated so many times that even a novice troll such as Abhijeet knows all the steps. And MNS? They, along with their elder sibling Shiv Sena, invented this dance.
Not that MNS or Shiv Sena believe that this message can stop terror attacks in India. If Fawad Khan leaves his projects in the middle, it will not hurt Pakistan or its political bosses. It will definitely not hurt the terror masterminds or their hardened acolytes who are anyway against dance, music and entertainment of any kind. The only ones who will get hurt are people in Bollywood, from the producers to the artists and technicians working on the project.
As police promises security “as and when required,” Pakistani artistes and Indian filmmakers are in the mood to weather it out. And we would say — more power to them. Because MNS, think about the cost of your political posturing?"

Express
The rising tension in India-Pakistan ties after the Uri terror attack have had a fallout in Chandigarh as well. The organisers of a trade show, to be held in the city from October 8-10, have cancelled Pakistan’s participation citing “national interest”.
In the past, all the Indo-Pak exhibitions held in Chandigarh have been huge crowd pullers.
In August a show was held in Kisan Bhawan in August, involving both countries which drew 50,000 people. Similarly, another exhibition, catering to wedding wear and fashion apparel, titled Nikah, was held at Himachal Bhawan in August which was a hit among the crowd.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Fifteen stalls from Pakistan and rest from India selling designer wear and fashion accessories were slated to be installed for the show, christened Riwaaz. A team comprising 20 people were scheduled to arrive from Pakistan for the event, however, the organisers Monday decided that it would be an all-Indian exhibition.
Minutes before declaring the cancellation of Pakistan’s participation, the organiser, an event company which goes by the name Glam Biz, dropped the word “Indo-Pak” from its cover page on social networking sites. Sharing information on this development, a Glam Biz representative said their Facebook page was flooded with negative comments, and this had also forced them to hold back the hoardings they had planned to put up in the city.
A release by the company stated, “Looking at the Indo-Pak tensions and keeping in mind the huge public outcry against Pakistan for perpetrating the Uri attack, organisers of the upcoming Indo -Pak Lifestyle Exhibition — ‘Riwaaz’, have cancelled the showcasing of Pakistani designer wear, fashion and accessories at the exhibition. The exhibition will now be a completely Indian Affair.”
It further stated , “The exhibition has been rechristened as just ‘Riwaaz’ -Karwa Chauth & Diwali Special. We are Indians and believe in our culture. Now it is going to be 100% Indian,” said Gagan from Glambiz.
After the declaration, the organisers withdrew the application for permission for “Indo-Pak exhibition” from the office of UT Deputy Commissioner and submitted a revised application for only Indian stalls. Ajit Balaji Joshi, Chandigarh DC confirmed the withdrawal of the application by this company.
Though paper work for visas was almost done and permissions had been applied for on behalf of Pakistan team, the organisers informed them this evening that their collection won’t be showcased.
“They were eager to come but the interest of the nation is first for us. National interests are above the commercial interests. When we informed them, some were disappointed since they had readied their collection while some said that they were prepared for it,” added Gagan.
Last week, the Pakistan High Commission said an exhibition – Aalishan Pakistan, which was to be held in Delhi would not be held as the “environment in India is not conducive”."

India’s chief coach Anil Kumble offered his condolences on behalf of the the national cricket team for the soldiers of Indian Army who lost their lives on Monday during a dastardly terrorist attack in Uri, a town in Jammu and Kashmir.
18 army personnel were martyred when four heavily armed terrorists attacked the Brigade headquarters near Line of Control (LOC) at dawn.

Asked to comment on the Uri attack, Kumble said:”Yes, in terms of our support to the people who safeguard all of us, we deeply condone their death. We honout their matryrdom. It is never easy for the families. As Indian team, we salute the bravehearts. The respect from our side will always be there.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, Virat Kohli, India Test captain, also raised his voice against the terror attack and said that images from Uri ‘fill him up with emotions he can’t explain’. He also paid his respect to the martyrs. The cricketer tweeted a picture of the attack site in Uri with smoke cover the whole site.
The four terrorists, who attacked at 4am on Sunday, were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC."

Pakistan and India should have friendly and good neighbourly relations and avoid hatching conspiracies against each other, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said. Sharif told reporters accompanying him on his visit to Turkey that even during the election campaign in Pakistan, his party did not adopt the policy of “India bashing” and ended this negative tradition. “We [Pakistan and India] should maintain good relations and avoid involving in conspiracies against each other,” he said, without elaborating.
Watch What Else Is Making News

India and Pakistan relations have been strained for the past over an year. The bilateral ties nosedived particularly after an attack on Indian Army base in Uri on September 18 last year by terrorists from across the border. Nineteen Indian soldiers were killed in the attack.
Ten days later, India conducted “surgical strikes” on terrorist launchpads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as a response to the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sharif said Pakistan was grateful to Turkey for its support on the Kashmir issue, according to a report in Dawn.
He also expressed gratitude for Turkey’s stance on Pakistan’s inclusion in the elite Nuclear Suppliers Group, which India is also vying.
Talking about recent incidents of terrorism in the country, Sharif said some elements who were upset with the progress of Pakistan were behind the current spate of terror incidents. He expressed the government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism at all costs.
“With our firm resolve, we will defeat those who are not digesting Pakistan’s success on different fronts,” he said, adding the involvement of a foreign hand in terror activities in Pakistan could not be denied, according to the report."

WITH A THIRD of the city’s police stations now functioning smoothly with all staffers working eight-hour shifts on rotation, the Mumbai Police is now monitoring 13 police stations added in the second phase of the reform.
“We have been successful in implementing the plan at 27 of the 93 police stations. The plan was started with 14 police stations and we found all these police stations managed to discharge their duties effectively. After a successful phase one, we have now added 13 more police stations and will take a review by the end of this month to see how they have fared,” Commissioner of Police Dattatray Padsalgikar told The Indian Express. “If they also perform well, we will take the drive to the third phase wherein 13 to 14 additional police stations, about one from each zone, would be added,” Padsalgikar added.
Months after taking over as the police chief in May this year, Padsalgikar started the drive to regulate constables’ working hours. A pilot project was carried out at the Deonar police station in the Central suburbs. After its success in Deonar, the drive was extended to one police station in each of the 13 policing zones in the city.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The review criteria includes how effectively the police station has been assigning the shifts, moving the manpower and multi-tasking its duties. “We have an in-charge at every police station who maintains a roster and he assigns the shifts to the policemen of the said police station. The senior police inspector takes a weekly review and updates his zonal Deputy Commissioner. A monthly review is taken by me,” said Padsalgikar. “I am in no hurry to implement it at all the police stations in one go and, therefore, it is being done phase-wise,” added Padsalgikar.
“Many constables attached to the Deonar police station had made a representation to the Commissioner, stating that owing to the proximity of the police station to the dumping ground their health was getting seriously affected and many of them were suffering from various health complications. Post that, the commissioner started the drive of regulated working hours at Deonar police station. The model was followed by other police stations,” said a senior police officer.
“Despite the city being put on high alert post the sighting of ‘terrorists’ in Uran, the Uri attack, the surgical strikes and even the continuous festival bandobasts, the police stations where regulated working hours have been implemented have managed to carry out daily operations just like the other police stations. However, the litmus test for phase two will be the Diwali festivities, if we succeed in that then we will commence phase three,” added the official.Mumbai NewsMumbai curfew: BMC allows 24-hours food delivery, movement of house helpsMaharashtra: Entertainment bodies to write to CM to allow production work, support daily-wage workersDecongest jails: Bombay HC suggests transfer of inmates to Paithan open prison to take care of cattle, farmingClick here for more
For Padsalgikar the drive has also brought some personal satisfaction. “As the police chief, I am responsible for the well-being of my men and if other countries can have an eight-hour shift, why can’t we?” he says. “I get many letters from my constables who are happy with the drive and that makes me happy,” he adds."

The Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday refuted Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s assertion that he had shared a ‘dossier’ with the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon containing information on the gross human rights violations committed in Jammu and Kashmir.

In a statement to the media, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said there was no mention of the so called ‘dossier’ in the United Nations Secretary General’s statement. “We don’t need a dossier, whole world is aware of Pakistan’s role in promoting terror. No one and I mean no other country at UN has spoken on the subject Mr Nawaz Sharif devoted 80 per cent of his time to. The onus is now squarely on Pakistan to act against terror groups, who find safe havens in Pakistan,” said Swarup.
Responding to a question by the media on a US Congress bill designating Pakistan as a ‘terrorist state’, Swarup said it will be surely treated with the utmost seriousness. “India hopes the bill to designate Pakistan as a terrorist state by two US lawmakers will be treated with utmost seriousness. Virtually every statement by other countries at UN has referred to terror as main threat to peace, Pakistan still in denial,” said Swarup.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Speaking on the Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir, Swarup said most countries have condemned the dastardly attack. “You would have seen the very strong condemnation of the attack by most countries including UK, France, Saudi Arabia and many others,” he added.
When asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Pakistan for the SAARC summit, Swarup said, “Every question does not have a yes or no answer.”
The MEA’s terse response comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif raked up the Kashmir issue at the UN,where he glorified slain Hizbul commander Burhan Wani as a “young leader” and also expressed readiness for a “serious and sustained dialogue” with India for peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes. Sharif devoted much of his 20-minute speech at the UN General Assembly session to Kashmir and the current situation in the valley and said Pakistan “fully supports the demand of the Kashmiri people for self-determination”.
Sharif had demanded an “independent inquiry into the extra-judicial killings” and a UN fact-finding mission to Kashmir “so that those guilty of these atrocities are punished.”"

The incident was condemned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who vowed that those responsible for the attack will pay.

Veteran actor Om Puri lent his support in favour of Pakistani actors saying that the ban on Pakistani artistes will not change the situation. He said Pakistani artistes are not working illegally in India and if they are sent back, Indian producers, who have signed them for their films, will suffer heavy losses. However, during a live debate on a leading channel, the actor said something which did not go down well with the audience and even his friends from the industry. Talking insensitively about the Indian martyrs, Puri said, “Who had asked the soldiers to join the army? Who told them to pick the weapons?”. He didn’t stop there. The actor further went on to suggest that India should prepare 15-20 human suicide bombers and send them to Pakistan for the blasts.

In fact, he also said, “Do you want India-Pakistan enmity to turn like Israel and Palestine, and fight for ages? India is home to crores of Muslims, there is no point in proving them for war. Several Indians have their relatives staying across the border and vice-versa, how can they fight a war with their cross-border families”. As soon as the debate went on air, the internet was flooded with criticism for Om Puri’s harsh words for those serving the country. In fact, the actor was also flaked by his contemporary Anupam Kher. On his official Twitter account, Anupam Kher wrote, “Dear #OmPuri ji. Mai aapki bahut izzat karta hoon. Lekin kal tv per desh ke sainik ke baare mein aapki baat sunkar bahut DUKH hua. #VerySad.”

While many supported Om Puri on his statement about the ban of Pakistani actors, his words for Indian army and comment over the issue of national security has raised quite a lot eyebrows. The actor’s remark came days after superstar Salman Khan opposed the ban too, by saying “they are artistes not terrorists”. The film industry has been divided on the issue of banning Pakistani artistes in the wake of Uri attack. Actor Randeep Hooda, filmmakers Ashoke Pandit and Anupam Kher are among those who have backed the ban.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Hooda tweeted that Pakistan should be culturally isolated. “We are trying to isolate Pakistan economically & diplomatically so the cultural isolation must follow #BanPakArtists #IndiaComesFirst #India,” he wrote. Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar said though he believes that art has no boundaries, the situation right now is such that nothing is bigger than the country. He also said that Pakistani artistes, who have worked in India should condemn the Uri attack. The debate began after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) demanded the ouster of Pakistani artistes from working in Indian film industry. Recently, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association also announced the ban on the actors and technicians from the neighbouring country till things became normal between the two nations."

Congress and BJP members on Friday clashed in Rajya Sabha over Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad’s remarks during demonetisation debate on Thursday, forcing adjournment of the House thrice in quick succession. Slogans and counter slogans forced the adjournment of the House first till 1130 hours, then till noon and again till 1233 hours as similar scenes continued.

Soon after listed papers were laid on the table of the House, BJP members moved into aisles shouting slogans and demanding an apology from Azad for his remarks comparing the deaths after demonetisation with those killed in terrorist attacks. The remarks were expunged by the Chair yesterday itself.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress members too rushed into the Well raising slogans demanding an apology from the Prime Minister and government for the hardship caused to the common man due to withdrawal of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation in the form of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes. AIADMK members were also in the Well raising slogans over the Cauvery water issue.
Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked all members to leave the Well and return to their seats, assuring them that he would hear their submissions.
Amid the din, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi alleged that Azad’s statement had given a message to the country that Congress was sympathetic to terrorism and asked why was it so agitated when the demonetisation drive was only to hurt blackmoney hoarders.
The Chair persuaded AIADMK and Congress members to withdraw from the Well, telling them that he would give opportunity to their leaders to raise their respective issues.

But with BJP members continuing to stand in the aisles and raise slogans, Congress members too were back in the well shouting slogans.
Kurien said treasury benches should not create problems for the Chair. “If you do this, what do I do? You should cooperate with me in running the House. Treasury benches should not disrupt,” he said.
But the din continued, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings till 1130 hours. There was no change in the scenario when the House reassembled as both BJP and Congress members again started raising slogans.
While Congress members trooped into the Well, several AIADMK members were seen standing along their seats.
As the slogans and counter slogans continued, the Chair adjourned the House till noon. When the House reassembled at noon, members from the Opposition again trooped into the Well demanding an “apology from the Prime Minister” for causing harrassment to the people. The BJP members were also on their feet countering the Opposition.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has described the Army’s strikes across the LoC as a “defining moment in the history of India”, the first ever instance of such a “coordinated strikes” on terror launchpads in PoK.
“This is a defining moment in the history of India,” Prasad said in an interview to The Indian Express, during he spoke about the need for the strike, its the implications, and the coordination of military, diplomatic and political efforts. “India has emerged as a mature power, as an emerging global power, whose diplomacy, strategic initiatives and capacity to deliver surgical strikes have all worked in enormous coordination,” he said.
He also “complimented” Prime Minister Narendra Modi “for the political will he has shown”, and praised the armed forces for “executing this surgical strike with enormous precision, without any damage”. “A great moral-booster victory has happened. The nation’s mood is surcharged and we are happy about it.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
But haven’t there been such strikes earlier with the Army going public only this time? “Maybe one or two instances have happened,” Prasad said, “but this organised strike happened for the first time. The experts themselves are acknowledging it, who are we to debate this?”
To a question about details of the damage inflicted on terrorist camps, which are yet to emerge, he said, “There is no need to distrust the Army establishment, who have publicly said we have caused heavy damage. Let us trust them… When they say extraordinary damage has been done, I trust them.” Asked whether his government is satisfied in terms of damage, he said, “Our country is thrilled. We are thrilled.”
Stressing the Uri attack was the tipping point in relations, he listed Modi’s friendly initiatives towards Pakistan in the last two years. Modi had invited Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in, Prasad said. “Disregarding conventional wisdom, protocol etc he chose to attend his [Sharif’s] granddaughter marriage. Every sign of accommodation was shown in the last two years that we should grow as good neighbour friends,” he said. “And then Pathankot happened, and then Uri happened. There comes a tipping point where the umbilical chord of patience gets broken. And Uri was that sign.”

He said India’s efforts to isolate Pakistan was part of the “defining moment”. “Most of the conventional allies of Pakistan, from Saudi Arabia to Iran and Qatar to UAE are realising that Pakistan is not playing a fair game,” he said, terming it a “great success of Indian diplomacy and Modi’s initiative”.
He noted India scored another victory when Islamic countries Afghanistan and Bangladesh too chose not to attend the SAARC summit in Pakistan, apart from Sri Lanka and Bhutan. “India has been able to pursue and satisfy the world that any terrorist attack the world over has a distinct Pakistani angle. Whether it’s Paris, London, New York or India,” he said.
He said the decision to carry out the strikes was “taken in sync with the popular mood, and in accord with the national interest”. “There was a popular mood, and there was an imperative of India’s strategic interest. Therefore, strategic restraint gave way to surgical precision.”
About the planning, he said, “These things are not done overnight. There has to be careful planning. There has to be a comprehensive study of all the implications.”
So, had India considered the possibility of a nuclear reply by Pakistan? “All these implications must have been considered,” he said. “Nuclear power is used more as a deterrence. You don’t display nuclear flamboyance like a street fight.”
He pointed out that the PM had even addressed the people of Pakistan and India and assured them the sacrifice of so many Indian soldiers will not go in vain.
He clarified the strike was “against terrorists and their launchpads,” and not against Pakistan per se”. “We will be the happiest to see Pakistan move towards democracy. They are nice people, creative people. But the forces have a vested interest in Pakistan”.
Will the strike help the BJP in the UP elections, he said: “We don’t look into political mileage. This was a duty we owed to the people of India. This is a commitment we owed to India’s strategic security.”"

Brazilian Foreign Minister Jose Serra on Sunday said slowing inflation and government efforts to rein in public spending should soon allow for an interest rate cut in Latin America’s biggest country. Serra’s comments, amid expectations that Brazil’s central bank could lower rates as early as this week after more than three years of tighter monetary policy, come as he and President Michel Temer sought to drum up a positive outlook at a meeting of the so-called BRICS group of developing nations in India.

“There is room, yes, for a rate cut,” Serra said, speaking to reporters after the BRICS summit, which gathered the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Many investors, after lower inflation figures last month and an improved outlook for the economy’s recovery, already believe the central bank’s monetary policy committee could begin cutting the benchmark Selic rate at its upcoming meeting on Wednesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Inflation in Brazil fell to 8.48 percent in the 12 months through September from 8.97 percent in the previous month. Because of rapid price increases in recent years, the committee has kept the rate at 14.25 percent since July 2015. Although Brazil remains mired in its worst economic recession on record, and economists forecast continued contraction this year and only slight growth in 2017, Temer earlier Sunday said that Brazil’s economy “is getting back on the right track.”
Since taking over for impeached President Dilma Rousseff, a leftist who was ousted in August over budget irregularities, Temer’s center-right government has focused on efforts to rebalance government books and has proposed a constitutional amendment that would put a ceiling on public spending."

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday claimed that terror attacks at army installations in Uri and Handwara in Jammu and Kashmir were carried out by Pakistan-based outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). A senior NIA official claimed that one of the four terrorists involved in the attack on the army camp in Handwara managed to flee.

The terrorists had attacked the camp of 30 Rashtriya Rifles camp in Langate in Handwara in October last year. While three attackers were killed by the security forces, one is believed to have escaped, the official said, adding they were looking into it.
Heavily armed terrorists had stormed the army base in Uri sector in September and killed 18 soldiers. There is proof indicating role of LeT behind Uri and Handwara attacks, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier, it was claimed that Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) was behind the attack. NIA is looking into both these cases.
The investigation in Uri attack case will gather pace soon as the agency officials earlier could not visit the points of ingress to verify certain leads due to shelling from across the border, the official said.
A team of officials is now likely to visit the area from where the terrorists might have entered and attacked the Uri camp, he said.
Talking about the Handwara incident, NIA officials said they recovered cell phones of Samsung and Huawei companies. These phones worked without SIMs using latest technology and manipulating its configuration, he claimed.
“The NIA had written to both Samsung and Huawei seeking details of these cell phones including information on shipments. Huawei had informed us that the phone was shipped to Pakistan. We are still awaiting response from Pakistan,” the official said.
There are other documents and proof in possession of the NIA that points towards LeT’s involvement in the attack, he said.
Besides, the cell phones’ Global Positioning System (GPS) sets and wireless system were found from the slain terrorists behind the Handwara attack. The NIA is in the process of getting information from Mauritius and Japan about the companies there which would have made these instruments, the official said.
Investigators have also found a diary from one of the slain terrorists and verifying a phone number, believed to be of one of their associates, mentioned there. They also claimed misuse of social networking sites Facebook and Twitter by the terrorists for communication, he said."

Actor Yami Gautam, who is currently preparing for her upcoming film Uri, says playing an intelligence officer commands a certain degree of discipline. “The prep work for Uri has just begun. Playing an intelligence officer on screen commands a certain degree of discipline and needs a body mannerism which is tough and MMA training will serve exactly that,” Yami said in a statement.
The film, directed by Aditya Dhar, is based on the Uri attacks of September 2016. Yami plays an intelligence officer alongside actor Vicky Kaushal in the film, who will also undergo some para-military training for a month to bulk up some kilos before starting the shoot.
“In terms of the action training, we are shortlisting best options and MMA is a crucial part of the role and that’s why intense training for that will be what time would be invested in. The MMA is more to suit the body language which the script demands,” she added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In September 18, 2016, terrorists from Pakistan attacked a military base in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir leaving 19 Indian soldiers dead. Eleven days later, the Indian Army retaliated with a surgical strike, heightening India-Pakistan tensions.
Meanwhile, Yami will also be seen in Batti Gul Meter Chalu, which also stars Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead role. The actor would be seen playing a lawyer in the Shree Narayan Singh directorial that revolves around the problem of high electricity bills despite long hours of power cuts.
“The role is something I have not attempted so far. I want to do something that adds versatility to me as an actor. So, I got a great chance in Batti Gul Meter Chalu and then of course, sharing the screen space with one of the most talented actors we have, Shahid,” Yami earlier told indianexpress.com in an exclusive interview.

India’s decision was followed by Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka skipping the SAARC Summit.
Stating that the regional environment is not conducive to host the SAARC summit in Islamabad on November 9-10, Nepal Sunday urged SAARC member states to “ensure that their respective territories are not used by terrorists for cross-border terrorism”. As SAARC chair, it officially informed all members about Pakistan’s decision to postpone the summit.
The Indian Express has learnt that late afternoon September 27, the embassies of SAARC countries — barring Pakistan — got calls from South Block for the boycott of the summit. This was about 36 hours before India conducted surgical strikes against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sources said the final decision to boycott the SAARC summit in Islamabad was taken after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj delivered her speech at the UN General Assembly on September 26.
Diplomats from SAARC member countries told The Indian Express that they got calls from the Ministry of External Affairs last Tuesday, between 4 pm and 5 pm, calling for the boycott of the SAARC summit.
Sources said within days of the Uri attack, New Delhi had made up its mind to corner Pakistan and isolate it in the region.
South Block deliberated on the pros and cons of the decision — since Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pitched himself as the leader of the region during the SAARC summit in Kathmandu in 2014 — before it reached out to its neighbours.
The final trigger, sources said, were two developments: First, Pakistan’s establishment calling the Uri attack a “false flag operation” or, in simple terms, a stage-managed attack. This response, which was made by Pakistan’s top diplomat at the UN, Maleeha Lodhi, angered many in the establishment.

Hours later on September 27, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar summoned Pakistan envoy Abdul Basit — for the second time in a week — to share information about the arrest of Pakistan’s nationals who had acted as guides for the Uri attackers and had also identified two of their handlers and one of the four slain terrorists.
This, in a sense, sealed New Delhi’s decision to boycott the SAARC summit. But none of the SAARC neighbours were given any indication of the surgical strikes that followed, sources said. While there were foreign minister-level discussions with some of these countries like Sri Lanka, diplomats worked the phones with other capitals.
Sources, privy to backroom negotiations for the boycott of the summit, said Indian embassies in these countries played a key role in bringing them on board.
While getting Bangladesh was expected since Dhaka’s relations with Islamabad had dipped in recent years over the war crimes trial, the “game-changer” was Kabul’s stance.
“Having Afghanistan on our side was key,” a source said, and said multiple conversations at diplomatic as well as political levels made it possible. Thimphu, which was also perturbed by the latest turn of events, came along with New Delhi. “No country was big or small… we wanted to isolate Pakistan in the region. Every country’s involvement counted,” a source said.
The first letter on the boycott, sources said, was sent by Afghanistan to the SAARC secretariat in Kathmandu. Kabul’s use of phrase “imposed terrorism on Afghanistan” was the result of its increasing frustration with Islamabad. President Ashraf Ghani, who visited India early September and met Prime Minister Modi, had conveyed his disappointment with Pakistan’s establishment, especially after the talks with Taliban did not make progress.
Following the Uri attack, when Ghani called Modi to convey his condolences, he also indicated his support to India for its actions against terrorism. This was a strong signal of unequivocal support from Kabul to Delhi. Thereafter, Afghan diplomats and South Block also exchanged notes.
For New Delhi, getting Bangladesh on board was not very difficult. Pakistan has been critical of the war crimes trial in Bangladesh, initiated by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and has repeatedly criticised Dhaka for the hanging of the Jamaat-e-Islami leaders. In fact, Bangladesh did not send its Home Minister for the SAARC Interior Ministers’ meeting in Islamabad last month, which was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
Bangladesh government sources said Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to visit Goa next month for the BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach summit, would have skipped the SAARC summit in Islamabad, and was planning to send the Bangladesh President instead.
However, the turn of events in Kashmir and then, Uri, led Delhi to exchange notes with Dhaka before the decision to boycott the summit was taken.
Bhutan, which was not directly affected by the terrorist attacks from Pakistan-based groups, conveyed its inability to attend the summit, since it wanted to show its solidarity with South Block.
“The window of decision-making was very narrow… the embassies worked closely with South Block… there was tremendous pressure on us,” a diplomat from one of the SAARC countries admitted.
A government source said, “It was a coordinated move… but the coordination was not difficult.”
Sri Lanka’s announcement, however, came after the surgical strikes and there was a clear reference to the “decisive” nature of India’s response. Soon after, Maldives also came out with its statement, followed by Nepal’s on Sunday.
In its statement, Nepal said it “regrets that regional environment is not conducive to host the 19th SAARC summit”.
The current chair of SAARC, Nepal said it “unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and expresses its solidarity in the global fight against terrorism”, and that it “strongly believes an environment of peace and stability is essential for a meaningful regional cooperation”.
“Most recently, Nepal has condemned the terrorist attack on Indian army base in Uri… that resulted in the loss of life of Indian soldiers,” it said, adding it will initiate “necessary consultation” for holding the next summit."

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday rubbished Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s baseless allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the latter’s Lucknow visit to attend the Dussehra festivities and said this reflected the Samajwadi Party’s insecurity prior to the state assembly polls.
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that one should not politicize the Prime Minister’s visit. “One should not stoop down so law. The Prime Minister is going to celebrate Dussehra. And if the Prime Minister is scheduled to celebrate it in UP then one should not politicize it. The political parties, who are commenting against his visit, are displaying a sense of insecurity,” he added.
Another BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao said that the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister should instead be ready to welcome the Prime Minister to Lucknow rather than making critical remarks directed at the latter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If he is going to be afraid of his one visit then let me inform him that the Prime Minister will be addressing several rallies in the run up to the Uttar Pradesh elections and he is only betraying his sense of jitters when talks about PM,” he told ANI
The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister earlier in the day dubbed Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming visit to the state capital to attend the Dussehra celebrations as politically motivated with an eye on the upcoming state assembly polls.
“What can I say about anyone going anywhere? We have to follow a protocol we will do it. I guess if elections were happening in Bihar then the Ravana would have been burnt there,” Akhilesh told a press conference in Lucknow.
Echoing similar sentiments, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati yesterday dubbed Prime Minister’s Modi’s visit to Lucknow a political stunt and said that the event should have been toned down taking into account the loss suffered by the families of soldiers killed in the Uri terror attack.
“The pyre of jawans who lost their lives in the Uri attack has not yet died down, but the Prime Minister is coming to Lucknow to celebrate Dussehra for his political motives,” she said.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit Lucknow and attend Dussehra festivities at the historic Aishbagh Ramlila ground on October 11."

We all are well aware of the hardships officers in the defence forces have to face. Putting their life at risk to defend the country and its citizens, the officers often have to stay away from their families for months at length.
Father of Ashok Kumar Singh, one of the soldiers who died during the Uri attack, has been blind for 20 years and was waiting for him at their home in Bihar. He had promised his wife that he’ll take her with him once he got the accommodation but the day never came.
This story of the wife of an Army officer posted on Facebook page Humans of Bombay explains exactly what it feels to live that life in constant fear, sometimes waiting for days to get a call from him informing her he’s okay and being a part of their daughter’s life despite being away for months.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A lawyer by profession, she couldn’t move around the country with him so the two decided that she’ll settle in Mumbai and pursue her career. She says that there were times when the only way they could communicate was through letters. “We see each other maybe once in every 4 months, but those 15 days of seeing and being with him mean everything to me; to us”
She also makes a very important point saying that we should celebrate our ‘Jawans’ every day and acknowledge their passion for the country.
Read her full post here.
“We first met when I was studying law at Symbiosis and he was a cadet in the Academy. It all started out in a funny manner — My friend and I would take a 11 Rupee bus ride every weekend to the NDA only because the food was much cheaper in their canteen! That’s how we became friends but pretty soon he moved to the IMA to Dehradun and as an officer he was posted all over India. Believe it or not, the only way we kept in touch through the whole time was through letters. It was 2002 and cell phones had just come in, so we would write to each other about our days; about our lives. They were all innocent letters, but they were amazing because it gave me an insight into how simple he is as a person.
6 years went by like this, and finally after that he sent me an SMS saying – ‘I really feel for you and I would like to be with you’— and at that point it all just fit. There was no over the top proposal, or exorbitant gesture…but there was love and stability.
After marriage I moved with him to Bhatinda, where I was working as a lawyer from home. Those two and a half years that we were together were so special, but being a professional I knew that I couldn’t move around every 2 years with him and some of the places he was posted the only job available to me was that of a teacher, and that’s not what I became a lawyer for.
Together, we took the decision that I would move to Bombay to pursue my career and he would continue his postings. It’s tough, it’s really tough but it puts so many other things in perspective. For one – our long letters have become long whatsapp conversations!
We see each other maybe once in every 4 months, but those 15 days of seeing and being with him mean everything to me; to us — we have a 3 year old daughter. I feel like there are no words to speak of an army man’s passion towards his country. Here we complain about bonus and leave dates, but in the army you’re at the same rank, with the same pay for a decade before moving up. He’s currently in aviation, but there are days when I wake up with anxiety an ask him not to fly. There are days when I miss him so much and my daughter will console me and tell me it’s for our country. He’s such a good father that even though he’s so far away, he’s involved with her school work — he often makes her recite what she learnt in class on the phone.
That’s the thing, we only celebrate our Jawaans once they’ve lost their lives, but we need to celebrate them everyday. My husband has lost so many of his batchmates to war or technical failures. There are days where there’s no communication between us because he’s in an area where there’s no network and finally after days he’ll call us up to tell us he’s okay. It’s so difficult for us, and even though this is his profession, I don’t think there’s been a day where he’s complained — everyday he wakes up with a smile on his face because he’s serving his country.”

Seven days after the deadly terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir , where 18 army soldiers lost their lives, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will give his first public speech. It would be Narendra Modi’s first public appearance after the attack and it is expected that he will address the issue. All eyes are on Narendra Modi’s speech with many keen on listening how the prime minister will address the neighbouring nation Pakistan, whose outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to be behind the attack.

Here are all the top questions on PM Modi speech answered.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
What time and where will PM Modi address the nation?
Narendra Modi will give a speech in Kozhikode, Kerala at 5 pm. He is in Kerala to attend national council meet for the party with general secretaries, office bearers and key state leaders.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi met with  the Indian Army, Navy and the Air Force Chiefs of Staff at his official residence in New Delhi.
Will Modi speak about Uri attack?
It is highly likely that he will.
Party leaders and cadres expect him to speak on Uri attack as the saffron outfit has been under fire over repeated incidents of Pakistani terrorists targeting defence facilities, more so as Modi had often flayed the UPA government over its alleged soft attitude to Pakistan in the face of terror incidents.
After the attack, PM Modi vowed in a strongly worded tweet that he will not let the perpetrators go “unpunished.”
Where can I watch it live?
The speech can be viewed live at PMO’s account on Youtube. You can also catch live updates on ANI twitter feed. Indian Express will also be doing a live copy on the speech."

In the wake of the recent Uri attacks, popular comedian Raju Srivastav has cancelled his show in Pakistan. He says after looking at the pain of families of the soldiers who died in the attack, he won’t be able to perform there. In a video, which went viral on Twitter on Saturday, Raju can be seen refusing to travel to Pakistan to “entertain those who murder our soldiers”.
“I have been invited to a comedy show in Pakistan. But every day, we can see at border how war is happening and our soldiers are being killed,” Raju said in the video.

 
“The soldiers who have died — I have seen their families suffering. Pakistan always betrays us while we always send the message of friendship, but they are not getting anything from our friendship,” he added. The terror attack, which took place on September 18, left 18 Indian soldiers dead at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Raju further said: “The situation that we are facing right now… I don’t think I can go to Pakistan to entertain those who murdered our soldiers. I can’t do comedy from inside. I don’t want to go to Pakistan. Our India is very good.
“Here, we have respect, love and humanity for each and everyone. We are happy here. I will not go to Pakistan to do the show.”
Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Friday also gave a 48-hour ultimatum to all Pakistani film and TV artistes to quit India or face consequences."

“We have verbally communicated to Indian music companies like T-Series, Sony Music, Venus, Tips Music etc to not work with Pakistani singers. These companies should stop it immediately or we will take action in our own style,” Amey Khopkar, head of the MNS Chitrapat Sena told PTI.

In 2016, after the Uri attacks, the Raj Thackeray-led party had similarly set a 48-hour deadline for all Pakistani artists working in India to leave the country."

The Army Sunday said there was an “unambiguous and clear” Pakistan link to the militant attack in Uri in which 11 security personnel, including eight soldiers, were killed, and that those who carried it out were trained like “Special Forces”.
“The Pakistan link to the Uri terror attack was unambiguous and clear,” said GoC 15 Corps Lt Gen Subrata Saha.
“The pictures of food, weapons, even antiseptic creams found on the slain terrorists were enough evidence to see the involvement of Pakistan in these attacks.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Army officer also said the militants involved in the Friday attack were looking for “civilian targets”.
“These terrorists were highly-trained like Special Forces. The kind of ammunition they were carrying shows they were in for a big haul,” he said. “The aim of militants must have been to come and strike at civilian targets to cause fear and disrupt the peaceful conditions during ongoing Assembly polls.”
He also rejected the charge that the militant attack was possible because of the failure of counter-infiltration grid along the Line of Control, saying the fact that all the six assailants have “been eliminated” shows success of the security grid.
“Had that been the case, they (militants) could have attacked the civilian targets that they were looking for,” he said.
“They (militants) came and banged against this position of ours and in a span of barely 60 odd meters, all of them were neutralised”.
On PM Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to Srinagar on Monday for addressing a poll rally, GoC Saha said the security grid is in place and the forces are “alert to counter any insurgency”.
“You are probably listening to some surveillance operation which is going on at top (helicopters). The grid is very much in place and it is highly effective,” he said."

In Ghazipur, an eastern UP district known for sending the largest number of young recruits to the armed forces, villages that have lost their sons are divided about their voting choice Wednesday. The diverseness of their views is like a reflection of the varying election campaign rhetoric on the Army, cross-border terrorism, Pakistan, Indian casualties and the strikes across the border. BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked the surgical strikes through the campaign and the party described it as the new bold approach of the army. Recently, he had said those questioning authenticity of the strikes should speak to the families of martyrs. Modi’s opponents, including Rahul Gandhi, have questioned the government’s policy saying more jawans are getting killed after the formation of the new government.
Watch what else is making news

“Pehle ke raaj me aisa nahi hota tha, ab yeh zyada ho raha hai. Aaye din koi na koi marta hai (there weren’t so many casualties of jawans during the earlier government. It is happening more now. Every day, someone is dead),” says Kedar Yadav, father of Harinder Yadav, who was among the 19 soldiers killed in the Uri attack in September last year. Sitting at the family’s house in Deupur village, he says Army jawans come from poor families and they are the ones getting killed. “It is good that surgical strikes were carried out but what is their use? There has been no impact of the strikes. No week goes by when a soldier does not get killed,” says Ramjeet Yadav, Harinder’s cousin.
About 30 kilometres away in Naseeruddinpur village, a different view prevails. “It is not that more jawans are getting killed now, it’s only that these deaths are being highlighted now,” says Pankaj Singh, cousin of Shashank Kumar Singh who was killed in an attack on the border in Kashmir in November. “It’s better to be in an attacking mode. I believe the new government’s approach is right. There is more liberty to the armed forces to strike back now,” Shashank was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest, Himanshu, too is in the Army. “Soon after my son Shahshank was killed along with other jawans, Modiji said that their martyrdom will not go waste. Soon the surgical strikes happened and many were killed in Pakistan. We cannot deny what the Modi government is doing in the national interest,” says Arun Kumar Singh. He has just returned from Kasimabad, where he opened a bank account for his nephew, Naveen, who too is going to join the Army now.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh is, however, concerned that his family and village have not been given what the public representatives had promised Shashank’s death. “The local SP MLA, Shadab Fatima, had promised to open a stadium in the village and change the name of this village to Shaheed Shashankpuram. MP Bharat Singh had promised to get a wedding hall constructed in his memory. Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha had said a lot will be done for us but nothing has been done. We are waiting for the elections to get over. Maybe, they will fulfil their promises after that,” he says.
In Noniyapur hamlet of Baddhaupur village, a new connecting road with inter-locking tiles has been built leading to the house of Manoj Kumar Kushwaha, who was killed in the same attack in November. The road was constructed by the zila panchayat. A banner remembering Manoj as a martyr hangs on the electric pole at the start of the road. A similar banner hangs outside his house. Kushwaha’s daughter Muskan has started going to school in class 2 and his son Manav is enrolled in LKG at R K Public School in the nearby village. His younger brother, Braj Mohan Kushwaha, says they are yet to get financial assistance from the central government. “We don’t blame the government for what happened. I think it’s better that the Army has more freedom. The jawans are facing threats not just from across the border but also from the Kashmiri militants. It is better to attack than just keep on defending,” says Braj Mohan, who runs a small shop in the village where he repairs electrical equipment."

Also, had threatened that will not allow the film’s release.
One of the most-awaited films of the year, Karan Johar’s directorial venture Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, has created buzz thanks to its heart-stirring music and well-packaged trailer, but also faced backlash due to a cameo of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, following which the makers have put a strong promotional plan in place.
With a few days left for the film to open in cinema houses on October 28, the makers plan to promote the film in the last 15 days. “We are grateful to our fans for their love and support for the trailer, songs and music. We definitely have plans to promote the film. We will be doing events and going on reality shows,” sources said.
Post the Uri attack, MNS had raised objection to Pakistani actors working in Hindi film industry. Also, it had threatened it would not allow the release of “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil”. Johar, however, came out in support of his actor friend Fawad Khan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Now, the promotions will be fronted by the film’s lead stars Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor. “We are waiting for Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor to kick start the promotions as they are busy with their prior commitments. They will be there to promote the film from mid

October,” sources said.
Anushka is currently shooting for Imtiaz Ali’s next with superstar Shah Rukh Khan.”Aishwarya Rai Bachchan will also be part of the

promotions. All four Karan, Ranbir, Anushka and Aishwarya will promote the film. Fawad Khan is having a special appearance so he won’t be promoting the film,” it added.

“Uri attack against India was horrific. Prayers are with victims’ families. I will continue to follow India’s subsequent counter terrorism op closely,” Congressman Steny Hoyer, Democratic Whip in the US House of Representatives wrote on Twitter on Friday.

Over a month, tensions between India and Pakistan have increased multifold. The attack on Uri left at least 19 Indian soldiers dead and India resolved to not let it go. Prime Minister Narendra Modi – in many of his speeches – had said that the attack will not go unanswered, and it didn’t. In retaliation, India carried out surgical strikes along the Line of Control on several terrorist launch pads causing ‘significant casualties’.
But while people of the country are celebrating the strike, families of the soldiers deployed on and around the border are scared for the lives of their loved ones guarding the country. After the strike, security has been tightened, and leaves of all the jawans have been cancelled because the possibility of a military operation between India and Pakistan has increased.
In the wake of the situation, cricketer Mohammad Kaif tweeted a heartwarming message for our jawans which touched a chord with many. “Leave of all Jawans have been cancelled. If in train or bus, you see a Jawan without a seat, do offer them a seat,” he tweeted.

This polite request by the cricketer isn’t anything that one might find difficult to do and it’s probably the least we, as citizens of the country, can collectively decide to do. Many came forth and applauded this gesture by Kaif, adding their own heartwarming messages for the Indian Army.




Kaif is not the first cricketer who has spoken after Uri attack. Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli had also raised their concern."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will skip the SAARC Summit, scheduled to take place in Islamabad in November. Plans to corner Pakistan are afoot, with Modi calling a meeting to decide the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status accorded to the country in 1996. He will chair the meeting on September 29 which will see top officials of the Ministry of External Affairs and Commerce Ministry in attendance. The prime minister has already been briefed on the Indus Waters Treaty, where India decided to exploit the eastern rivers to the maximum. At the meeting, Modi was quoted saying, “rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta (blood and water cannot flow together)”.

The risk of India turning off the Indus tap has evoked a strong response from Pakistan. Advisor to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Foreign Affair, Sartaj Aziz on Tuesday said India cannot unilaterally distance its self from the treaty and insisted that revocation of the treaty can be taken as an “act of war”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The international law states that India cannot unilaterally separate itself from the treaty,” Aziz said, while briefing the National Assembly on the issue.
India has also put the squeeze on Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit, with Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar summoning him today for the second time since the Uri attack. The Pakistan envoy was presented with evidence that the Uri attack had origins from Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. He also revealed that probe agencies has identified one of the Uri terrorist, and that he was from Muzaffarabad. Two guides who helped the four terrorists infiltrate the Army camp in Uri have also been identified and taken into custody, Jaishankar said.
On Monday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj gave a stinging reply to Sharif’s address at the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly. In her reply to Pakistan, Swaraj said that India offered friendship but got Pathankot and Uri in return. She also asked Pakistan to abandon the Kashmir dream as it is an integral part of India. Swaraj also raised the issue of human rights abuse in Balochistan."

Amid heightened tension with Pakistan following yet another brazen terror attack on an Army base, India is likely to step up efforts to corner it diplomatically and mobilize support for concrete action against state-sponsored terrorism at the two-day Heart of Asia (HoA) conference beginning in Amritsar on Saturday. Afghanistan, which has also been witnessing increased attacks from terror groups operating from Pakistani soil, is set to push hard for a regional counter-terror framework with “binding” commitment at the annual meeting of Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, a platform set up in 2011 to assist the war-battered country in its transition.

Top officials of the 14 member countries will meet to discuss key challenges facing the region including from terror groups and explore ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Afghanistan. On Sunday, the main conference will be jointly inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani where both India and Afghanistan are likely to corner Pakistan on terror.
Pakistan Prime Minister’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz will represent Islamabad at the conference and all eyes will be on whether an Indo-Pak bilateral meeting takes place on the sidelines. Ahead of Aziz’s visit, India had on Friday said it will never accept continuing cross border terrorism as the “new normal” in bilateral ties with Pakistan while making it clear that talks cannot take place in an atmosphere of “continued terror”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India had called for isolating Pakistan diplomatically after the Uri attack on an army establishment and it is likely to continue efforts in that direction at the Heart of Asia conference. At the BRICS summit in Goa in October, India had called Pakistan the “mother ship” of terrorism globally. Aziz is scheduled to arrive on Sunday and is expected to return the same day. The entire holy city, which is not far from Indo-Pak border, has been decked up, while multiple layers of security have been put in place. Strong vigil is being kept along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab. It was clear that dealing with terrorism will be a major focus at the conference as both India and Afghanistan earlier this week called terror emanating from Pakistan the “greatest threat” to regional peace and stability.
Afghanistan has been pushing for an effective counter-terror framework and the matter will be discussed at length at the conference being attended by representatives from over 30 countries including China, the US, Russia and Iran. The Indian delegation will be led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the absence of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is ill."

The editorial in Organiser, ‘The Proxy Politics’, slams the “tirade from different quarters asking for proof of surgical strikes.”
It says that “politics in Bharat has regrettably taken such an ugly turn that like terrorists or irregulars from Pakistan even politicians have become proxies of anti-national thinking.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

It criticises the “self-proclaimed soldiers of humanism and secularism”, who “echoed the Pakistani position on recent cross-LoC surgical strikes”. “It is certainly a proxy ploy for someone else or else a proxy demand to attain different political objectives,” it says.
It accuses Pakistan for its “anti-Bharat paranoia”, and then asks that the “people and parties in Bharat, who gang up every now and then with an anti-Modi approach, should ask themselves whether they can afford to follow the same by playing proxy politics”.
Attacking the Aam Aadmi Party, it says that by asking for proof of surgical strikes, it indirectly provided “fodder to Pakistan”. “Kejriwal and his nascent party can afford to choose that path in an experimental mode,” the editorial says, adding that when the Congress raises “questions about the credibility of armed forces”, it is “something dangerous and indigestible”.

“As if that is not enough, intellectuals and artists, who are expected to show the path of righteousness through creative means, are joining the calibrated attempts of divisive bandwagoning for selfish motives,” it says.
Sensex India
An article in Organiser says “Bharat has been invaded by both Sensex India and Maoist India”. “Sensex India” refers “to the western-style institutionally organised economy and lifestyle”, and “includes all those Indians who relate to the corporate sector as investors, producers or consumers”. “The major metros and second-tier towns have now largely been taken over by this segment,” it says. The proportion of Indians in this category has “mushroomed in the past decade of India’s globalisation”, it says, underlining that “Sensex India uses Western models that are based on centralised governance, extreme materialism, greed”. “There are many desperate revolts against Sensex India, being provoked on the grounds of feeling exploited and marginalised,” it says, and notes that “Maoist Indians allege that they are victims of cultural genocide which is being carried out behind the smokescreen of progress”. However, “Maoist India is not one unified movement, but several desperate movements spread across the country”.
“The Sensex Indians are following imported right-wing capitalist models,” whereas “the Maoist Indians are following imported left-wing models to redress their grievances”.
“Each attacks Bharat with its own imported theories,” it says, noting that “both are foreign nexuses based ideologies, and both are tearing Bharat apart”.
It proposes a “healthy integration of Bharat and Sensex India”, with “lessons learned from the Maoists”.
Peripheral Pakistan
The editorial in Panchjanya says that Pakistan is nowhere compared to India on various parameters, but its “arrogance” is supreme. It’s surprising that India continues to give Pakistan more importance than it deserved. “It is neither possible nor fruitful for India to think about Pakistan all the time,” it says.
“How can we more forward by tying a backward country to our sub-consciousness,” it notes and praises the government for clarifying its stand to Pakistan. “It should be accepted that through the surgical strikes India has also performed surgery on its Pakistan complex,” it says. It is true that you cannot close your eyes to your unstable neighbour, but it is dangerous to “carry anxieties all the time”, and continue hold an illusion of friendship with the enemy. “It only aggravates the illness,” the article says, and asks why, under such conditions, should we not amend the policies that show undue politeness to Pakistan. “The events after the Uri attack show that India has not only witnessed a change in its government, but the country’s mood has also changed decisively,” it says.
Noting that even China has expressed its limitations in favouring Pakistan, it says that the “decisive change” in India’s stance will eventually be more fruitful in the field of global peace, humanity and development."

PTI
EVEN AS the Opposition sought strong action against Pakistan over the Uri attack, there was a visible toning down of rhetoric ,on retaliation, from the BJP and the government on Monday.
In the government, ministers avoided taking hawkish positions. “The Kashmir situation needs to be thought about. The action has to be taken without getting influenced by emotions, anger. It has to be taken coolly and with proper planning,” Union Minister of State Gen (retd) V K Singh was quoted as saying by PTI.
Jitendra Singh, MoS in the PMO, who on Sunday called for introspection and an effective strategy to deter such attacks in future, said today that the government would take the right decision at the right time. “The entire country wants that we respond to it, and the home ministry and defence ministry will decide on the strategy to be adopted. The right decision will be taken at the right time. The government will take a decision taking into consideration all aspects. It will be in the interest of the nation and keeping in mind the sentiments of 125 crore Indians,” said Singh on Monday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We will have to redeem the sacrifices of our brave soldiers in whatever way decided. On the issue of national security, I think all political parties stand united. If there is anyone who feels otherwise, they will have to answer to the nation,” he said. His ministerial colleague, Kiren Rijijju, MoS, Home Affairs, said: “We must not pay heed to Pakistan’s reaction. Everything is in front of the people. We will take our next steps carefully. It does not matter what Pakistan says.”
The BJP was equally restrained. A day after its senior leader Ram Madhav sought “for one tooth, the complete jaw”, the ruling party on Monday tried to strike a balance between the hawkish stand and the practical approach the government has to take before considering any action against the neighboring country. Party leaders said the government has to exercise restraint even as its cadres and political compulsions force it to take a hard position.
BJP leaders refused to comment on Madhav’s remark about the days of strategic restraint being over. “Facebook posts and tweets are individual views,” said a spokesperson. “We know the government is serious. But we can’t decide what action or approach it should take,” said a senior party leader. “Modi is serious about the response,” he added.

“While India gave many chances, Pakistan kept closing all doors of peace. It looks like Pakistan does not want peace and compromise. But we can’t say how we would respond. There are different ways — diplomatically, economically or through the Armed Forces. We have not tied the hands of the Army. The Army is free to take steps and the government will stand by it. Diplomatically, isolating Pakistan at the international forum is one way, and naming and shaming it for the terrorist activities is another way. From our side, the government has already been working on the three-tier fencing of the LoC,” said BJP national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh. However, he added: “You don’t have to speak to act.”
Watch What Else Is Making News


According to BJP leaders, the party is keen to see that the government takes “strong action” at various levels. Pointing out that the government is left without any option after it allowed Pakistani officials to visit the Pathankot air base after the attack there, a BJP leader said the government would “definitely take some action.”
Outlining the options, he said the government could target the training camps in PoK. “Another option is to weaken those who receive the militants/ infiltrators inside our soil. So the Hurriyat and other separatists should face pressure. The government will not leave any loose ends here,” he said."

Reacting to questions over punishing perpetrators of the Uri terror attack that claimed the lives of 18 Indian soldiers, the Army on Monday said it has desired capability to respond to such blatant acts at the time and place of its choice.
“We reserve the right to respond at the time and place of our choosing. We have desired capability to respond to such blatant acts of aggression and violence as deemed appropriate by us,” said Director General of Military Operation (DGMO) Lt Gen Ranbir Singh.

In a press breifing, Singh said that infiltration bids from the other side of the border habe increased this year in comparison to last 3-4 years which indicated Pakistan;s desperattion to create disturbance in Valley. “During 2016, there have been a total of 17 infiltration bids across the LoC, which have been sucessfully eliminated by the Army. It indicates very desperate attempt from across the border to push infiltrators into India with a view to create disturbances,” said Singh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also told media that the item recovered from the slain terrorists have Pakistan stamps. “Total recoveries during the operation include 4 AK rifles, 4 grenade launchers, 4 under barrel grenade launchers. Recoveries include, large quantity of food and medicine packets, having markings of Pakistan,” said Singh.

Meanwhile, the high-level meet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Uri attack decided to gather evidence against Pakistan to isolate the neighbouring country at international fora.
Accoridng to sources, Modi wants clear evidence of Pakistan’s complicity to be presented to all major global fora, including the upcoming UN General Assembly.
The meeting was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minster Manohar Parrikar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Army Chief Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag and other senior officials in the PMO, Defence Ministry and the Home Ministry.
The meeting is believed to have also considered several other options, the sources said, but these were likely to be measured and well thought-out."

India is set to raise the deadly Uri attack in which 17 Army soldiers were killed, at the 71st United Nations General Assembly and highlight Pakistan’s involvement in the deadly terror strike.
According to sources, India will raise the matter in the UN General Assembly and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will strongly emphasize on Pakistan’s involvement in her speech on 26th.
Sources also state that no decision has been taken as yet on the Prime Minister’s participation at the SAARC summit meet in Islamabad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Branding Pakistan a ‘terrorist state’ and stating that it should be identified and isolated as such, Home Minister Rajnath Singh yesterday said there are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped.
“I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan’s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,” he said in a series of tweets.
Meanwhile, condemning the terror attack as well, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the nation that those behind the ‘despicable’ attack will not go unpunished.
“We salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,” the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.
Hinting at the Jaish-e-Mohammad’s role behind the Uri attack, India’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh also asserted that the evil designs would get a befitting reply.
However, Pakistan has flatly refused New Delhi’s claims of Islamabad’s involvement in Uri terror attack, claiming that India pointing fingers at them has become a traditional tendency after each terrorist attack.
“Pointing fingers at Pakistan has become a traditional tendency of India after each terrorist attack,” the Dawn quoted Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria as saying.

“In the past many Indians were involved in the terrorist acts for which India had blamed Pakistan,” he asserted.
At least 17 soldiers lost their lives and 19 others injured post the terror strike on an army camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla district.
All four terrorists have been killed in what has emerged as worse than the attack on the Pathankot air base earlier in January this year, in which seven army men were killed."

No previous Prime Minister has focussed on the Indus Waters Treaty, MFN, Balochistan or coordinated a boycott of the Saarc summit, leave alone order a surgical strike. These steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi since the Kashmir agitation’s present round, and especially after the Uri attack, seem to indicate a re-examination of the foundations of India’s Pakistan’s policy. It would be a pity if they constitute only unrelated tactical measures to deal with the current situation.

As Modi proceeds, it is useful to examine if the underlying principles of the traditional approach towards Pakistan have served India well. Pakistan was created on the basis of faith and on the assumption that Muslim interests would never be secure in a Hindu majority state. It was a logical corollary that India would be considered through the prism of faith; a Hindu country. It was equally inevitable that if a Hindu majority within India was projected to be perpetually antagonistic to a Muslim majority, a Hindu India would be looked on as a permanent threat — and a constant enemy.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Some Pakistani scholars claim Jinnah wanted both countries to cooperate but that proposition ignores the path he chose. Leaked official Pakistan documents such as the Abbotabad Commission Report conclusively show that what should have been anticipated by Indian policy makers came to pass.

The Kashmir issue provides the clearest example of Pakistan’s faith-based India policy. Pakistan holds that it is the “unfinished agenda of Partition” and wants the state’s Muslim majority areas. However, even if Kashmir is resolved, it’s unlikely Pakistan will give up its basically hostile approach towards India for it is rooted in the fundamental principle of its state’s creation — a perception, though false, of two antagonistic faiths.
The founding fathers of the Republic correctly rejected a theocratic state to mirror Pakistan. However, should this have led those who fashioned Indian foreign policy thereafter to approach Pakistan by overlooking its theological moorings? Was this done partly because of the fear that such an acknowledgement itself would weaken the national enterprise? That a secular India could not premise its policies towards Pakistan on the basis of its inherent hostility? That such an approach would weaken India’s secular fabric? If this is so, it did the greatest disservice to our Muslim co-citizens — for it assumed they had a special interest in Pakistan. This was not warranted. And it led India to positions that ironically pandered to Pakistani prejudices.
This is best seen in India’s acceptance of the Indus Waters Treaty, extraordinarily generous to Pakistan, providing it 80 per cent of the waters, harshest to Jammu and Kashmir. India agreed to it to assuage Pakistani fears of being starved of water. It failed to do so. Indian policy makers never probed the reasons for this failure. Is it because it would throw up inconvenient conclusions about India’s refusal to accept Pakistan for what it is?
Foreign policy must never overlook the fundamental moorings of a state, especially an antagonistic one. This doesn’t imply doors for negotiations should be shut. However, generous concessions must be evaluated to assess if they lead to a dilution of hostility. Often, they reinforce prejudices, as seen in India-Pakistan trade relations. Pakistani studies demonstrate Pakistan would gain far more with a MFN-based trade regime. However, the army disallowed it because of fears that it may not be able to control it — but also because of its prejudicial association of trade and Hindus, it has felt trade is a pressure point against India.
The Indian political and strategic class does not think in religious terms in public policy, including foreign policy. It finds such thinking retrogressive. It offends its sensibilities. But Pakistan does and the refusal to acknowledge that has served India ill.

Indians seem to be divided on the issue of whether Pakistani actors should leave the country or not after the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena threat asking them to go back. The threat came a few days after the Uri attack in which at least 19 Indian soldiers were killed. But veteran actor Om Puri belongs to the school of thought that asking Pakistani artistes to leave the country will not solve the problem. He said, “Who had asked the soldiers to join the army? Who told them to pick the weapons?” which, as expected, didn’t go down well with many on social media.
In addition to this statement, Puri suggested that India should prepare 15-20 suicide bombers and send them to Pakistan.

“Do you want India-Pakistan enmity to turn like Israel and Palestine, and fight for ages? India is home to crores of Muslims, there is no point in proving them for war. Several Indians have their relatives staying across the border and vice-versa, how can they fight a war with their cross-border families,” he said during a debate on the leading news TV channel.
A police complaint has been filed against Puri at the Andheri police station in Mumbai for being insensitive towards the soldiers who lost their lives for the country.
Amid those who slammed Puri was his co-worker Anupam Kher, who said he was hurt by his statement.

In the age of social media, there are a very few who have been able to put forward some bare facts with logic which people can’t ignore, or get trolled for. Renuka Shahane, the popular film and television actor of late 90s, has been one among them who can put forward legitimate arguments at a time when social media is filled with hatred and fanaticism.
Her posts on social media platforms, raising pertinent questions when needed or just to say what is needed to be heard in a situation, have made her a star. All her recent posts have not only gone viral but also led to sensible debate. Be it her post on offering shelter to Irom Sharmila or Burkini ban to the very recent one on India-Pakistan crisis and the controversy surrounding Ae Dil Hai Muskhil, she has voiced her opinion with flair and hardly missed the point.
Only on Sunday, the Hum Aapke Hain kaun actor asked, “Is our “nationalism” about soft targets to lynch?”  She also raised a justified point and asked, “If Karan Johar is asked to sacrifice the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, shouldn’t business houses and Industrialists also show solidarity with the soldiers who’ve lost their lives?”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
And while people were still debating about her stance, Karan Johar broke his silence and said that henceforth he would not work with Pakistani talent. Though many were not satisfied as Johar bowed down to MSN’s ultimatum and Home Minister and Maharashtra CM intervened to get a grip on the grim situation, the row is still ongoing.
Shahane this time put forward a timeline and asked, “We might as Indian citizens be able to put our differences aside & be able to keep India above Art & Sports but will our politicians be able to keep India above Politics?”
Through her timeline she highlighted many instances about attack on film industry, their apology and the hypocrisy of such groups.
Here is the full text of what Renuka Shahane wrote in her Facebook post
Some time lines for people with short term memory only:
Feb 3 2008: Mrs Jaya Bachchan asks, “Who is Raj Thakeray?” after MNS targets North Indians in Mumbai

 Sep 8 2008: MNS targets Mr Bachchan for being brand ambassador of UP & setting up a girls school there instead of Maharashtra. Mrs Bachchan makes a sarcastic comment about speaking in Hindi at a music launch of a film.

 MNS starts a stir against the release of Mr Bachchan’s “The Last Lear”.

 By that time Mrs Bachchan had come to know who Raj Thakeray was and therefore apologises for her remark.
Cut to
Oct 2016: Mr Bachchan receives a personally sketched portrait by Raj Thakeray for his birthday & he gifts a watch to Raj Thakeray’s son.

 Somewhere along the way Mr Bachchan became brand ambassador for Gujarat

 There were no protests by the MNS

 Guess Marathi-Gujarati bhai bhai but UP-Marathi not bhai-bhai!
Now Karan Johar.
Oct 2009: MNS protests use of ‘Bombay’ instead of ‘Mumbai’ in Wake Up Sid

 Karan apologises saying, ” It was a genuine mistake on our part. Henceforth we will use Mumbai instead of Bombay”

 MNS protests withdrawn.

 Bombay Times was being printed then & now

 MNS doesn’t protest.
Cut to
Sep 2016: MNS protests against the casting of a Pakistani actor in “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” in solidarity with the martyred jawaans of the horrendous Uri attack
Flashback
26/11/2008: The dastardly Mumbai attacks. Many civilians killed by Pakistani terrorists

 Tukaram Ombale martyred while capturing Kasab live.

 Many defence personnel are martyred.

 Many Pakistani artists, singers, writers work here & go back.
2nd Jan 2016: Many defence personnel martyred at Pathankot
March 2016: Kapoor & Sons is released & becomes a hit. It has Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in it.

 MNS does not protest
The present:
18/10/2016: Karan Johar apologises saying he will never cast a Pakistani actor again

 Exhibitors of single screens still will not show the film

 Our Home Minister says that it is business as usual in the country. Visas will be given to Pakistanis to come here & work. There will be no ban on Pakistani actors on the part of the Central Govt

 MNS does not protest our Govt’s decision.

 Karan Johar is to meet the Home Minister today.
Flash forward:

 Karan Johar gets a portrait personally sketched by Raj Thakeray?
The present again:

 After winning 3 wars at home, helping to win many in other lands, winning thousands of battles & skirmishes, being martyred in huge numbers, helping in any civil unrests, riots, natural disasters, helping all Indians irrespective of caste, race, language, gender; at last our Army has supposedly reached an International status at par with the Israeli Army that is protecting people of a land approximately 1/4th of our square kilometres and 1/100th of our complexity!!!
I thought our Army was always one of the best in the World.

 Meanwhile the tu tu main main over surgical strikes continue between the Congress & the BJP.

 The political squabbling & posturing continues.
We might as Indian citizens be able to put our differences aside & be able to keep India above Art & Sports but will our politicians be able to keep India above Politics?
I don’t think so.
I don’t think they will ever be able to practice what they preach!

Ganesh Shirsekar
The Maharashtra Navirman Sena on Friday issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes working in India, asking them to leave the country within 48 hours or “risk being beaten up”. “When our soldiers are being killed on the borders by Pakistan, why should we host their actors here? We warn all Pakistani actors to leave India in the next 48 hours. If they do not do so, MNS activists will give them a thrashing,” said Ameya Khopkar, president of the MNS Chitrapat Karmachari Sena.

The Shiv Sena too has supported the demand to block entry of Pakistani actors in the country after the Uri attack.
“Why are we continuing any kind of relationship with them? The time has come to snap all ties with Pakistan immediately,” said Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Khopkar also said that the MNS would target not only Pakistani actors, but also the producers and directors who hire them.
“Pakistani kalakaar toh maar khaayenge hi, saath mein jo producer/director unko laate hain unko bhi peetenge (Pakistani artistes will be beaten up, and so will the producers and directors who get them here),” he said.
Several Pakistani artistes are part of Indian films either as actors or singers.
The Mumbai Police, meanwhile, has claimed that it will protect all foreign individuals who are working with proper work permits in India.
Leaders from the ruling BJP also joined the chorus of not disallowing actors from Pakistan to perform in the country in the current environment.
Kirit Somaiya, Member of Parliament, BJP, while saying that he did not back the threats issued by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, said, “At this point of time, we appeal to business leaders, film producers, and organisers not to invite artistes from Pakistan for events and films.”"

Stating that terrorism was the root cause for the ongoing unrest in Kashmir, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday said the situation should be left for the Army and the government to deal with. “Terrorism is the main cause for the ongoing unrest in Kashmir Valley. We are pained to see when innocent youth are killed after being threatened by terrorists to throw stones at the security forces,” he told reporters here.
“People who have never thought of leaving Kashmir are now going to other places because they want to live a peaceful life. The day terrorism ends, all the problems in the Valley would end,” he said.
On being asked whether talks should be held with Pakistan as advocated by NC leader Farooq Abdullah during a meeting of opposition parties yesterday, the minister said, “Such issues should not be made a public debate. The issues of national interest and national security should be left to the Army and the government to decide.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Union Minister for Food and Public Supplies also hit out at the separatists for giving cold shoulders to the all-party delegation, which had gone to meet them last month to discuss the Kashmir unrest.
“There needs to be a ground for holding talks, first they (separatists) should accept that India is ours, this is our country and we will resolve all the issues under the ambit of Constitution of India. Till the time you raise pro-Pakistani slogans and their flags, there is no point holding talks,” he said.
The LJP leader said in a democratic country, everybody had the right to protest, but they should not spoil the life and future of school-going kids.
“The child is unable to go to schools, to get education. What will he do in future?,” he said.
Kashmir is reeling under tension due to the unrest which erupted after killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an alleged encounter in July.
Commenting on the opposition’s onslaught against the Modi government regarding the Army’s PoK strikes, Paswan said, “After the Uri attack, opposition started abusing the Prime Minister and mocked that his 56-inches chest has been reduced to 26-inches. When they blame the leader for bad things, why do they shy of giving credit to him for good things?”
The Union minister also called for keeping armed forces out of politics.
“People of Pakistan are not our enemy. Our enemy is terrorism and we are fighting it. The decision of when, how and where to fight terrorism should be left on the wisdom of the Army,” Paswan added."

More than three-fifth of Indians support use of military force to defeat the scourge of terrorism, according to a latest Pew Survey released Monday which said that about half of the respondents disapprove of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Pakistan policy.
“With roughly half (52 per cent) the Indian public worried that ISIS poses a major threat to their country, about six-in-ten Indians (62 per cent) believe that overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world. Just 21 per cent say relying too much on such force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism,” said Pew Research Center in its report running into 40 pages.
While 68 per cent of the respondents feel that India is playing a more important role in the world than it was doing 10 years ago, the Pew Research Center in its annual survey, which was conducted among 2,464 respondents from April 7 to May 24, said half of the respondents disapprove of Modi’s management of India’s volatile relationship with Pakistan. His Pakistan policy is approved by just 22 per cent, said the survey which was conducted in the months after the terrorist attack at the Pathankot Air Force base coming from across the border.

“Notably, however, more than half of BJP supporters (54 per cent) and a plurality of Congress party adherents (45 per cent) disapprove of the prime minister’s handling of relations with Pakistan,” the report said. In the handling of China, supporters of Modi’s own party, the BJP, are more likely than adherents of the Congress party to favor his conduct of bilateral relations. Pew said Indians are ready to support more defence spending.
Across party lines, more than six-in-ten (63 per cent) think the country should increase spending on national defence, just six per cent want to decrease it and 20 per cent want to keep it at current levels.

Notably, Indians who see China’s growing military power as a very serious problem are more likely than those who see China’s growing military power as a less serious threat to favor increased military spending, it said.
According to Pew, the Indian public’s satisfaction with the direction of the country has increased 36 percentage points since 2013, the year before Modi took power. The survey found that Indian public’s ciews on the economy have improved by 23 points.
And belief that today’s children will be better off financially than their parents is up eight points. The survey said that Modi continues to ride a wave of good feeling (81 per cent) about the way things are going in India, the state of the domestic economy and his own stewardship of the country. In 2015 Pew Survey, Modi’s approval rating was 87 per cent.
Modi’s favorable rating of 81 per cent is followed by that of Sonia Gandhi (67 per cent), Rahul Gandhi (63 per cent) and Arvind Kejriwal (50 per cent). Modi has the lowest unfavorability rating of 16 per cent followed by Arvind Kejriwal (27 per cent), Sonia Gandhi (31 per cent) and Rahul Gandhi (32 per cent). Like Modi, the ruling BJP has an approval rating of 80 per cent, followed by Indian National Congress (67 per cent) and Aam Admi Party (47 per cent).

About half or more of the public approves of Modi’s handling of a range of domestic problems facing the country: helping the poor and dealing with unemployment (both 62 per cent), handling terrorism (61 per cent) and dealing with corruption (59 per cent). And roughly half or more of Indians in the survey approve of Modi’s leadership style: 56 per cent believe he cares about people like them, 51 per cent say he stands up for what he believes and 49 per cent say he brings people together and gets things done, Pew said. Pew said Indians also favor toughness in dealing with the world.
“Nevertheless, Indians give priority to issues at home. By more than two-to-one (53 per cent to 23 per cent) they believe that India should deal with its own problems and let other nations deal with theirs. This public preference for a focus on domestic issues reflects ongoing concerns about a range of issues: Roughly eight-in-ten Indians believe crime, corrupt officials, a lack of employment opportunities and terrorism are very big national problems,” Pew said.
Observing that only about a third (31 per cent) of the public expresses a favorable opinion of their emerging Asian rival, Pew said these positive views are down 10 percentage points in the past year, but unchanged from 2014.
“Another 36 per cent voice an unfavorable opinion and 32 per cent have no opinion. Large majorities say Beijing poses serious challenges for India. Seven-in-ten of those surveyed believe that China’s economic impact on India is a serious problem, including 45 per cent who voice the view that it is very serious. Nearly half (48 per cent) of Indians think China’s relationship with Pakistan poses a very serious

problem for India,” Pew said. Pew said eight-in-ten Indians believe their economy is doing well, up 16 points since 2014. And 35 per cent of Indians today say the economy is very good.
People in the northern states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh express the most satisfaction (71 per cent) with the direction of the country. Those living in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are the least satisfied (55 per cent). Roughly four in-ten living in the north say the economy is doing very well (42 per cent), while people living in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh (26 per cent) and in the south (30 per cent) are less likely than those in the north to believe the economy is performing very well. People living in the eastern part of the country – in Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal – are more confident (83 per cent) than those in the north (62 per cent) and west (70 per cent) about prospects for the next generation.
Crime (82 per cent), lack of employment (81 per cent), corrupt officials (80 per cent) and terrorism (78 per cent) are the top four national problem, according to the respondents surveyed by the Pew Poll.
On Modi’s popularity, Pew said while he continues to have a favorable rating of 81 per cent, the share of Indians with a very favorable view of Modi is down 11 percentage points in the last year. In both 2015 and 2016, Modi’s lowest approval rating (53 per cent) was for his handling of communal relations. On India US relationship, more than half (54 per cent) of Indians approve of Modi’s dealings with Washington. Just 15 per cent disapprove, it said. “Notably, public approval of Modi’s handling of America is down 12 percentage points since 2015 despite his having visited the US more than any other country during his premiership,” Pew said."

Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday charged that the Narendra Modi government does not have a ‘stable’ policy towards Pakistan and has not been able to decide on how to put Islamabd in the dock in the wake of the Uri attack.
On the Indus Water Treaty, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir said the government should consider all pros and cons and take a decision keeping in mind the future.

“The BJP government does not have a stable policy towards Pakistan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Nawaz Sharif to his oath taking ceremony and visited the Pakistani premier uninvited on his birthday.
“And many a times, he has adopted a very tough stance against Pakistan. His government has not been able to decide on how to deal with Islamabad,” Azad, who was here to launch Congress’ yatra from Deoria to New Delhi, said.
“In the Modi government, the Foreign Secretary favours talks with Pakistan but the National Security Advisor suggests suspension of the dialogue with Islamabad. Nobody knows what they want,” he said.
Taking potshots at the Prime Minister, Azad claimed that Modi had promised the people of the country that he would “avenge the death of our soldiers and that he would bring 10 heads for every martyred jawan, but he has forgotten them now”.
To a query on the Indus Waters Treaty, he said the Modi government believes in taking a decision in seconds on issues that have been there for decades.
“It should consider all pros and cons and then take a decision in this regard. Bilateral issues have many other things linked to them. A decision concerning such issues should be taken keeping in mind the future,” he said.
Azad blamed the PDP-BJP government for the ongoing unrest in Kashmir, saying there was peace in the Valley when the National Conference government was at the helm of affairs, but tension is prevailing there since the new government has taken over.
He also hit out at the central government for not sending more emissaries to different countries.
“While Pakistan has sent over 15 emissaries to create pressure in its favour, India has sent only a couple,” he claimed and said there was a need for exposing Pakistan at the international fora.
Asked if his party was open to a tie-up with other parties for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, he said, “Congress will go alone.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said there was anger in the nation following the terrorist attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir which left 18 jawans dead. “Those responsible for Uri attack will not go unpunished,” Prime Minister Modi said, adding that he had huge respect for the Indian Army and had full faith in them. “Peace, unity and harmony are the ways to resolve problems and move towards development,” Modi said in a message to Kashmiris.

Read the full text of his Mann ki Baat speech:
My dear countrymen, Namaskar! We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir. I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them. This cowardly act has shocked the entire Nation. There are strong emotions of widespread grief as well as anger across the country. And, this is not only a loss for the families who have lost a son, a brother or a husband. In fact, it is a national loss. And, therefore, I will just reiterate to you, my countrymen, what I had said that very day, that the guilty will certainly be punished.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces. They will foil with their valour every such conspiracy, and they are the ones to reach the pinnacle of bravery so that we, their 1.25 billion fellow countrymen, can live peacefully and be happy. We are proud of our army. We politicians have many opportunities to speak our mind and we do speak. But, the forces do not speak, they take action.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir. Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces. And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace. Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest. Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country. Economic activities too should be back on track. And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities. We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations. I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir. Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration. The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order. I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir. We shall strictly abide by this. At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas. These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy. Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought. He has written – “I was very much distressed after the Uri attack and strongly felt like doing something. But, I did not know how to go about it as what could a young student like me possibly do. So, I was trying to find some way to be of some service to the nation. And I have resolved that I would devote three more hours daily towards my studies. I shall become a capable citizen so that I can serve the country well.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age. But, dear Harshvardhan, I shall also like to add that the anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value. It symbolises our national consciousness. This anger has the resolve to do something. Yes! You have presented that with a constructive approach. But, you must be aware that during the 1965-war, Lal bahadur Shastri Ji was leading us and then also similar feelings of rage, anger and patriotic fervour were sweeping the nation. Everyone wanted that something must happen, must be done. Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation. Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism. During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement. Now, if all of us, that is, our armed forces, people in the government, fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely, and all of us countrymen, each citizen make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism, our country will most definitely scale greater heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.S. Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit. Shri Varun Vishwanathan has also written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes did a commendable job and that I should talk about this in ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics. Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people. And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say. When the medal was awarded to her, she said – “Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.” There is great strength in this remark. This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country. Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold, one silver and one bronze. Brother Devendra Jhajharia won the gold medal in Javelin throw and repeated his gold winning performance after 12 years. One gets older over a period of 12 years and after having won the gold medal once, the passion for the same is also somewhat reduced. Yet, Devendra displayed that physical condition and increasing age could not dent his strong determination and he successfully claimed his second gold medal after a gap of 12 years. And, he was not born a DIVYANG. He lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock. Just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump. Thangavelu had lost his right leg when he was just 5. Even poverty could not come in the way of his resolve. He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family. Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country. As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump. Medals in Paralympics have a significance of their own, but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our DIVYANG brothers and sisters in our country, our society and our neighborhoods. These have not only inspired our empathy but also changed the way of looking at the DIVYANG people. Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time. Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Can anyone ever imagine the DIVYANG athletes breaking a record set during the general Olympic Games? It happened this time. In the 1500 meter race, Abdellatif Baka of Algeria set a new record by completing the 1500 meters race taking 1.7 seconds less than the time taken by the gold medalist in the same event at the general Olympics. Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race. I once again congratulate all our Paralympic athletes and India is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat. It was a very emotional moment for me. Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day. A visually challenged little girl child Gauri Shardul, hailing from far flung forest area in the Dang District, can recite the complete Ramayana epic as she has learnt it by heart. She rendered certain portions before me and when I presented her performance before other persons there, everyone was amazed. I got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some DIVYANG persons had been compiled. These were very inspiring incidents. Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important. The task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired DIVYANG people in just eight hours was completed successfully. This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records. Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched ‘Swachha Bharat Mission’ two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu. That day too I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, a duty for every citizen and there should be an atmosphere harbouring a sense of revulsion against filth. Now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd October and I can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness. I had said ‘one step towards cleanliness’ and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further. This means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness. This affirms that the direction we have taken is correct and also fruits of the action are very sweet. It has also been seen as to how much can be achieved through making small efforts. Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role. I also know that we still have to go much farther. Yet, the beginning has been good so far. Whole-hearted efforts have been made and a conviction has now set in that we shall indeed succeed. This conviction is important. If we talk of rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh or say about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we intend to build another one and a half crore toilets in the coming one year. From the point of view of sanitation and keeping in mind the dignity of our citizens, especially the dignity of our mothers and sisters, it is necessary to put an end to the habit of defecating in the open. And, with this in view ‘Open Defecation Free’ or ODF Campaign has been launched. A healthy competition towards achieving liberation from the habit of defecating in open has started at the levels of states, districts and the villages. Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve very soon cent percent ODF targets. I visited Gujarat recently and the officers there informed me that Porbandar, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the target of total ODF on 2nd October, 2016. My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target. I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge. Let us forge ahead with a strong resolution.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy. Every citizen has a right to know about the status of the cleanliness mission in his city and the Government of India has provided a dedicated telephone number – 1969 for this purpose. We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869. In 1969, we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet. You must avail this facility. Not only this, a cleanliness, that is Swachchhata App has been launched for people to lodge complaints concerning cleanliness and also to know about the progress in resolving these complaints. Please make full use of this facility; especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally. Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour. They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission. They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
It will not be sufficient to keep this Cleanliness Campaign confined to beliefs and habits. Imbibing cleanliness as a nature is not enough. In this age, just as cleanliness is related to health, connecting cleanliness to a revenue model is also equally necessary. Waste to wealth should also be one of its components. It is, therefore, imperative that we need to move towards ‘Waste to Compost’ along with the Cleanliness Mission. Solid waste should be processed and be converted into Compost and the government has initiated a policy intervention in this regard. Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste. They should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming. This should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers. And for this, Shrimaan Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador.
I invite youngsters to set up new ‘start ups’ also in this ‘Waste to Wealth’ movement to develop the means and processes, to develop the suitable technology and accomplish mass production at an affordable cost. This is a task worth doing. There is also a big scope of employment generation and an opportunity for tremendous economic activity and wealth creation from waste is achievable. This year a special programme ‘INDOSAN’ – India Sanitation Conference is being organized from 25th September to 2nd October. Ministers, Chief Ministers as also Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness. What can be achieved with technology? What can be the financial model? How to mobilize public participation? How can employment opportunities be increased in this sphere? All these topics will be discussed. And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in. I recently read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University launched a Jagran Abhiyan (Awereness Campaign) to build toilets in 107 villages. They themselves put in physical labour and contributed significantly in constructing around 9000 toilets. It might have come to your notice some time ago that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Veer Singh, a team covered a distance of 2800 kilometres by swimming in Ganga from Dev Prayag to Ganga Sagar to spread the message of cleanliness. Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments. Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department – these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas. Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely – Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas. I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes. You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days. Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities. Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh. Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time. In this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created. I expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji. Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day. I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali. This year also I request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate Diwali. This year 2nd October is a Sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way? You involve yourself physically for 2 hours, 4 hours with cleaning work and I request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on NarendraModiApp. If it is a video, then share the video. You will see that with our joint efforts, this movement will get a fresh boost, a new dynamism. Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine. I witnessed it some time back when I asked the countrymen to give up their cooking gas subsidy and they responded whole-heartedly. This in itself was a very inspirational event in India’s national life. Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize ‘Joy of Giving Week’ from 2nd October to 8th October. Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons. When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to walk the streets seeking donations of old toys from families and then presented these toys to Anganwadis in poor neighbourhoods. These toys provided great pleasure to the poor children, which was a great sight to behold. I feel that we should encourage and help these young people who are organising ‘Joy of Giving Week’ in many cities. This is a kind of a ‘Donation Festival’, a Daan Utsav. I convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today. Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay undertook the tremendous task of defining and elaborating upon the political ideology being followed by lakhs and lakhs of workers like me. He was a supporter of a political ideology connected with the roots of India, he presented his own soul stirring political philosophy, the EKAATM-MAANAV DARSHAN alongside the ideology to uphold India’s great cultural heritage. The centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay is commencing from today. ‘Sarvajan Hitay – Sarvajan Sukhay’, the principle of ANTYODAY – these are his gifts to us. Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue. How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development? ‘Work for every hand, water to every field’ – through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda. The country should celebrate his centenary year as GARIB KALYAN VARSH, ‘Year for Welfare of the Poor’. We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor. The place where I live was known as Race Course Road since British rule but now in the centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Updhyay this has been named ‘Lok Kalyan Marg’. This is a symbolic representation of the ‘Year for the Welfare of the Poor’, the centenary year of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay. I respectfully pay my homage to revered Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, who has been a source of inspiration to all of us, and an embodiment of our intellectual heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Vijayadashmi two years ago. My sincere effort was that ‘Mann Ki Baat’ should not become a programme of praising and highlighting only government’s achievements; Mann Ki Baat should not become a programme of political oneupmanship, allegations and counter allegations. and sometimes passionate advocacy. Despite numerous pressures during these past two years – sometimes being tempted due the surrounding atmosphere, at times with provocations to say something with indignation – overcoming all such impulses over these two years with your blessings, I have moved through these obstacles and earnestly tried to connect with the common man through Mann Ki Baat. How the common man of this country keeps on inspring me all the time? What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man in the country? And this common man, who occupies my mind all the time, always gets projected in Mann Ki Baat. For our countrymen, Mann Ki Baat may be a source of information.
For me, Mann Ki Baat has been the means to feel the strength of my 1.25 billion countrymen, to recall their great capabilities and power and to draw inspiration from the same for my own endeavours and initiatives. On completion of two years of Mann Ki Baat this week, I wish to express my sincere gratitude from the core of my heart to all you listeners who appreciated it, who contributed to improving it and thus blessed me. I am grateful to All India Radio also which not only broadcast my views but also put in their best efforts to transmit it in all languages. I am also thankful to those countrymen who knocked on the doors of the government by writing letters and by sending in suggestions and highlighting shortcomings of the government and All India Radio mounted special programmes on these letters by inviting concerned government functionaries and thus provided a platform to address the problems. Thus, Mann Ki Baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15-20 minutes. What can be more satisfying than this for any one? And therefore, I thank everyone and express my gratitude to all who contributed in making it a successful programme.
My dear countrymen, from next week festive season will be ushered in with Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepavali and all such activities. This is an occasion for praying to SHAKTI, Unity in society is the power or SHAKTI of the country. Be it Navratri or Durga Puja – how can this SHAKTI-UPASANA become the festival of celebrating social unity? How to make it a festival of social bonding? And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory. Let us bow before Shakti, nurture it, march forward with the mantra of unity. Come, let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja festivals with peace, unity and harmony to enable our nation to scale newer heights. Let us celebrate victory on Vijayadashmi.
Thank you very much."

Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his Raees co-star Nawazuddin Siddiqui will visit Dubai ahead of the film’s release to promote the action thriller. Raees, directed by Rahul Dholakia, is slated to release on January 25.
According to a report in Khaleej Times, Shah Rukh and Nawazuddin will visit Bollywood Parks, a first-of-its-kind theme park, and will later visit the Night Court of Arabian Center where they will meet and greet fans. The team is likely to be here for a two-day visit, said a source in the know of developments. But it is not yet clear if Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, who features in a pivotal role in the movie, will be part of the Dubai promotions.

 
Shah Rukh had last month assured Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray that Mahira will not come to India for promoting the film. This came after the MNS had strongly protested against hiring of Pakistani actors by Indian filmmakers following the September 18, 2016 Uri attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Dubai is also a place close to Shah Rukh, who had last month also featured in a #BeMyGuest film by Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), inviting people to be his “guest” at the city of sun, sand and adventure. He also owns a house here.

Meanwhile, Raees makers will be releasing its original sound track separately in the music album. The film’s director Rahul Dholakia says the source of inspiration was the Sholay album. “I was a kid when ‘Sholay’ released, but I do remember listening to Gabbar’s theme and the iconic dialogues on radio. So, when the idea came up about the original soundtrack (OST) I was most excited,” Dholakia said in a statement."

Veteran lyricist-writer Javed Akhtar lashed out at Pakistani artistes, saying the fact they have not condemned the Uri attack is a kind of a “confession” that the country is responsible for it. Akhtar, 71, said he does not see any reason behind Pakistani artistes’ silence on the attack.

“The silence of Pakistani actors is a form of confession that Pakistan is responsible for it (the attack). If Pakistan says they aren’t responsible for it, I don’t see any reason any Pakistani artiste should not condemn it. If they say, ‘We are not responsible’ then very good, come out and condemn it,” he told a news channel.
 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier in the day, actress-MP Hema Malini sought to steer clear of the controversy surrounding the demand for a ban on Pakistani actors working in Bollywood, saying she respects the artistes but cannot ignore the sacrifice of Indian soldiers.
“As an artist I appreciate their work but I don’t want to comment about whether they should live here or leave this country,” she said at an event in Delhi. “Artistes are artistes whether they are from Pakistan or India. But it is unfortunate that they are from Pakistan. I must say that they are good artistes. They have performed well here in India,” the BJP MP from Mathura added.

Maintaining that Pakistan’s argument has no takers at the United Nation, Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar has said that Islamabad can fool its people but cannot fool the world on terrorism.
“In the speeches at the UN it was all clear that Pakistan’s argument has no takers. No one even agrees to it. And our [India’s] word on terrorism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said about it, Sushma Swaraj has said it, and you can see the results. Now the world understands all of it and says that whatever India is saying is right because we are saying it from faith,” Akbar told ANI.
Akbar insisted that whatever New Delhi has talked about on terrorism, it has been doing it on the basis of truth and proof, adding that India wants a world which is united and progresses rather than engaging in wars.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On being asked about Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s statement that India has no proof on Uri attack and is only accusing Islamabad for terrorism, Akbar replied, “I am sure there are at least 1-2 scientists in Pakistan, or someone who can understand about DNA samples. Nawaz Sharif might not have any idea on it but if we send the samples to them, they will get the proof of Pathankot and Uri attack.”
On the Balochistan issue, Akbar said that the entire world now knows about the atrocities on the Baloch people. “Whatever European Union has said is very necessary. The entire world is seeing and knows about the real atrocities carried on the people and this is happening in Balochistan. This has been recognised across the globe and it will only increase.”
Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj reached New York last night. She will address the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on September 26. According to sources, India would raise the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri region, in which 18 Indian Army soldiers lost their lives and highlight Pakistan’s alleged involvement.
Sources further added that Swaraj will strongly emphasise on Pakistan’s involvement in her speech. Launching a scathing attack on Pakistan, Prime Minister Modi had yesterday said that India would never forget the Uri terror attack and would make all efforts to isolate Islamabad globally. He also called on international community to join hands to defeat terrorism. He also insisted that India exports engineers all over the world, whereas Islamabad exports terrorists."

Congress president Rahul Gandhi Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi “can’t leave aside his public relations exercise even for five minutes”, news agency PTI reported.
Gandhi said that the PM tells media that the country is united after the Pulwama terror attack but immediately targets Congress party. He (Modi) did the same at war memorial opening, Gandhi said.
The Congress chief was addressing a public rally in Dhule district of north Maharashtra.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Congress chief also ridiculed Anil Ambani over the Rafale aircraft deal, saying the industrialist “can’t even make a paper plane”. He also alleged that “Rs 30,000 crore went into Ambani’s pockets under the PM’s watch”.
Earlier today, PM Modi during an election rally in Kanyakumari referred to the 2008 Mumbai attacks saying ‘no action was initiated against the perpetrators by Pakistan but you saw what our brave men did after Pulwama and Uri attacks’.

“There was a time when the news reports would read- Air Force wanted to do surgical strike after 26/11 but UPA blocked it. Today, we are in an era where the news reads- Armed forces have full freedom to do what they want, ” PM Modi had said.
He also slammed the Congress party during the inauguration the National War Memorial in New Delhi on Monday over its stand on the Rafale deal. “The scandals of Bofors to the tainted helicopter deal reaching to one family says a lot, now the same people are desperately trying that the Rafale does not fly in the Indian skies,” he had said.
While addressing a rally in Mumbai later in the day, Rahul said, “If you want to hear lies, go to Narendra Modi’s rallies.”
He added, “Modi will call Mehul Choksi as Mehul bhai (brother) but call you ‘Mitron’ (friends).”
The Congress chief also targeted the PM for not addressing the media. “I address press conference; have you seen the ‘darpok’ (coward) ‘chowkidar’ addressing a press conference?” he asked."

If you don’t eat something, you’re patriotic. If you carry the flag, you’re patriotic,” says Nikkhil Advani, on the sets of his television debut, P.O.W.: Bandi Yuddh Ke.
Filmmaker Nikkhil Advani is taking a gamble on the small screen with a drama set 17 years after the Kargil War– P.O.W.: Bandi Yuddh Ke. In these frenzied times, will it pay off and put him back on track?
I’d like to redefine patriotism because it has become a very privileged thing today. If you don’t eat something, you’re patriotic. If you carry the flag, you’re patriotic,” says Nikkhil Advani, on the sets of his television debut, P.O.W.: Bandi Yuddh Ke, in Kamal Amrohi Studios, Mumbai. “In some villages in Punjab and Rajasthan, the eldest son has to join the army. It’s hereditary and it’s what is expected of them. Where does that kind of nationalism come from? I don’t know, I don’t have it.”
Mumbai’s famed October Oppression is upon the city and it’s easier to talk about patriotism and the show during breaks in the 45-year-old filmmaker’s air-conditioned office. An official adaptation of the hit Israeli show, Hatufim (2009), P.O.W. is about two soldiers of the Indian air force and the army, Squadron Leader Imaan Khan (played by Satyadeep Misra) and Naib Subedar Sartaj Singh (Purab Kohli) respectively, who return home 17 years after being captured by Pakistani troops during the Kargil War in 1999.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The timing couldn’t have been better — or worse — depending on which side of the screen you’re on. The show’s trailers hit the small screen nearly a month after the Uri attack, and a week after the surgical strikes that followed. “What we’re asking here is that if circumstances demand, kya aaj ka hero kal ka villain ban sakta hain? P.O.W. is going to be the grittiest show ever on Indian television,” says Advani.
The scene he returns to direct, however, is set in a less alarming environment — a mela where the families of both soldiers meet. “I’d like to take fewer shots but television demands more close-ups,” Advani grumbles as he flits between the monitors and the sets of a large Punjabi house. There is only standing room on the floor, what with the crew setting up the trolley, a handful of extras milling about, the main cast — Misra, Kohli, Sandhya Mridul and Amrita Puri — getting their faces dabbed every few minutes by a small army of make-up artists. The only casualty of the heat is a mountain of laddoos that sit atop a table in the corner, unforgivably ignored by all and sundry.
Advani isn’t really complaining, though. “I’m not adapting to television, the medium is adapting to me,” he says. While the budget is nothing compared to what he usually works with, P.O.W. is being shot on a budget higher than most TV shows. With its detailed sets and costumes, the seven-track original soundtrack by ad-world darling, Arjuna Harjai, the show is being given the “Nikkhil Advani treatment”. “Star Plus got in touch with me after D-Day. They wanted to make something in the political space and I told them, but that’s not what your channel stands for!” says Advani.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-3084472"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg"" alt=""P.O.W.: Bandi Yuddh Ke cast."" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg 1280w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/nazneen-and-family.jpg?resize=608,405 608w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> P.O.W.: Bandi Yuddh Ke casts.
By all accounts, P.O.W. is Star Plus’s foray into making serious television for the urban masses — those who are drawn to the fantastical setting of Game of Thrones over the makkhi-metamorphosis of Sasural Simar Ka; the broken characters of True Detective instead of ACP Pradyuman’s leap-over-logic in CID; and Breaking Bad over Powder, a 2010 show about the narcotics trade in Mumbai that was cancelled after one season. “So, we wrote some stuff that was very radical and edgy. But we decided not to make it because it would have ruffled a lot of feathers, politically. Then Star suggested Hatufim, on which Homeland is based,” says Advani.
The Israeli show left him “stunned”. “Gideon Raff, who wrote the show, has written about the real prisoners of war — the families and the women, who are trapped between hope and despair. What I look for in any story is an emotional core. Look at Godfather. It’s not a story about the mafia, but about an American immigrant family. Ram Madhvani, one of the cleverest people I know, made a film (Neerja) not about an airplane hijacking, but about a mother and daughter. D-Day was not just about espionage, but about a father and his son,” says Advani.
“I’m making P.O.W. because I also wanted to tell the stories of two women, played by Sandhya and Amrita, who pick up the pieces of their lives after Kargil. The wives and families of these soldiers are the real patriots to me,” he says. Advani also asked Star to pay all the leads equally, “because each one of them is a hero in the show.”
But P.O.W. doesn’t solely rest on an emotional spectrum. Advani and his crew of four writers, Aseem Arora, Aniruddha Guha, Eisha Chopra and Gauravv K Chawla, are keen to engage with larger questions of identity and nationalism in the show. “It was a conscious decision to have two minorities essay the role of the heroes of the show. The popular perception is that Squadron Leader Khan, captured in Pakistan, will be the first one to turn. It allows us to question the audience that there is no way they did not think that woh toh Mussalman hai, woh toh zaroor gaddar niklega,” he says.
His team is willing to show torture at prison camps in as much graphic detail as Indian television will allow. Torture, he says, plays a significant role, as does post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “What we show is what we’ve learned from real-life accounts of soldiers. There’s a scene where Sartaj and Imaan recount how every four years, they’d be brutally beaten up, more than usual. Later, they figured that it would coincide with every time India beat Pakistan in cricket. We’ve juxtaposed the torture scene with a crowd chanting ‘Sachin! Sachin!’ So when Sartaj returns, he asks, ‘We beat them every time?’ They remember they were beaten more. Then somebody says, ‘Blame the ICC, they started the T-20 World Cup’,” says Advani, with a grim chuckle. “I think it’s tough to show nuance in a show where one is talking about Pakistan as the enemy, but we should. At the end of the day, everybody has something that makes them human. There are good guys and bad guys, and I don’t think you can ever balance it. I will invariably take a position but I don’t want to become a jingoist,” he says.
P.O.W. is also quite a gamble for Advani, whose last successful directorial outing was D-Day, three years ago. 2015 was particularly brutal for the man who shot to fame with Kal Ho Na Ho and was returning to romance with Katti Batti and Hero — two films that tanked rather spectacularly at the box office. “I really believed in Katti Batti, I don’t know what went wrong. I thought the last 25 minutes were superb. But as somebody asked me, what about the first one hour, 45 minutes?” says Advani. The failure of the two films sent him to Bollywood’s numerologist, Sanjay Jummani, who prescribed an extra “K” in his first name.

2016 has gotten off to a good start. His company, Emmay Entertainment, produced the year’s first big hit, Airlift, but Advani modestly credits director Raja Krishna Menon and Akshay Kumar for its success. He acknowledges that he could have done things differently with Hero. “The shift in the direction of the film was my fault. I could have turned around and said no. For me, Hero was a repayment of a debt I owed to Salman Khan, who stood by me after I left Dharma Productions and when the industry wrote me off,” he says.
Back in 2003, Advani says, when Kal Ho Na Ho was released, rumours abounded that his friend and colleague, Karan Johar, had shadow-directed the film. “It was odd, because lots of people have said that Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham have been shadow-directed by me! Karan and I sit back and laugh at this now. Back then, we should have spoken to each other, we didn’t. Our egos got in the way,” he says. Advani and Johar were at Greenlawns High School, Breach Candy, together, where the former was sports captain and Johar’s senior. “Karan played one sport: tug-o-war,” says Advani and guffaws.
He talks about how Johar, Tarun Mansukhani and he got into Bollywood, without a clue about filmmaking. “The first day of shooting Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, we got so much equipment and we were enjoying ourselves. Till Shah Rukh Khan called us and said, ‘You don’t know anything about making movies, you better learn’.” And so we did. A lot of my shot breakdown is learned from Farah Khan. We were a great team,” says Advani. Dharma delivered three blockbusters between 1998 and 2003. But the partnership between the two friends ended after Kal Ho Na Ho.
“When the trailer came out, I was busy in post-production. People would ask me, why aren’t you doing interviews? If I’d done them, there possibly might have been less bitterness on my part. We didn’t speak to each other for six months. The film released in November 2003 and I left Dharma next April. Salaam-e-Ishq happened two and a half years later. It was a film made completely out of spite. People thought I couldn’t make one love story, so I made six! It was like an all-you-can eat buffet: I mixed Chinese food, French cuisine, Italian, Indian. At the end of it, you’re going to get a stomach upset,” says Advani wryly.
Between 2008 and 2012, a spate of Advani’s projects failed at the box office. “Before D-Day, I had lost everything. Chandni Chowk to China and Patiala House didn’t do well; in 2012, Delhi Safari, India’s most expensive animated film, ruined the producers. It won a National Award only a year later,” says Advani. Today, a sequel, Beijing Safari is being directed by Daniel St. Pierre, who directed Disney’s big hits such as The Lion King and Aladdin.
“Before D-Day, I was writing a Sex and the City-kind of chick-flick. But every studio I went to, they asked me, who’s the guy? You couldn’t sell a film based only on the women. But I think Vidya Balan changed that in a big way, with The Dirty Picture and Kahaani. Kangana Ranaut, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra have contributed as well. I feel Shoojit Sircar, Sujoy Ghosh, Vikas Bahl, producers like Viacom have changed that. It takes an industry. Films don’t fail, unless it’s a downright bad story, but budgets fail. One has to figure out the market as much as the merit of the film,” he says."

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday glorified slain Hizbul commander Burhan Wani as a ‘young leader’ seeking to accuse India of not wanting to resolve the dispute between the two nations. He was speaking at the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Sharif said his country supports ‘self-determination’ for the people of Kashmir, calling for a United Nations fact-finding team to visit Jammu Kashmir to record “extra-judicial killings” that he claimed have taken place in the region.
Minutes after Sharif concluded his speech, India rejected Pakistan’s false accusations asking if calling for an end to terrorism as a condition for talks was too much to ask for. India also reiterated its stand that Pakistan is a terror state and that the government in that country was allowing terror organisations to roam freely in its lands.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Here are the responses from India to Nawaz Sharif’s UNGA speech.
Talks and guns don’t go together: MJ Akbar
Minister of State External Affairs MJ Akbar slammed Sharif’s speech at the UNGA saying “we just heard a speech full of threat bluster and rising immaturity and complete disregard of facts.”
Akbar, who is in New York, also rejected Sharif’s offer of ‘serious dialouge’ saying “talks and guns don’t go together.”
“Pakistan at this moment seems to be run by a war machine rather than a government. Pakistan wants dialogue while holding a terrorist gun in its hand,” he said.
Akbar also slammed Sharif for his remarks on Kashmir, saying: “Kashmir occupation is by Pakistan occupation army. The world also knows that Pakistan has been indulged in ethnic cleansing of its own people.”
On Sharif’s mention of Burhan Wani, Akbar responded: “We heard the glorification of a terrorist. Wani is declared commander of Hizbul, widely acknowledged as a terror group. It is shocking that a leader of a nation can glorify a self-advertised terrorist at such a forum. This is self incrimination by Pakistan PM,” Akbar said. Read more here

‘End to terrorism as condition for talks not acceptable?’
The first official response to Nawaz Sharif’s address at the UNGA came from spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup. In a series of tweets, Swarup countered Sharif’s allegations against India asking if an end to terrorism as a condition for talks was unacceptable to that nation.
“PM Sharif at UNGA says India poses unacceptable conditions to dialogue. India’s only condition is an end to terrorism. This not acceptable?”
He also questioned Sharif for his silence on Sunday’s Uri attack: “Pak PM Sharif at UNGA in complete denial of Uri terror attack. 19 infiltration attempts stopped at LoC this year. Indigenous??!! Pak PM Sharif at UNGA glorifies Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani in UN’s highest forum. Shows continued Pak attachment to terrorism.” Read more here

Right of Reply at the United Nations General Assembly
At the United Nations, exercising its Right of Reply, India responded to Sharif’s “long tirade” with First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Eenam Gambhir saying “the worst violation of human rights is terrorism.”
“When practised as an instrument of state policy it is a war crime. What my country and our other neighbours are facing today is Pakistan’s long-standing policy of sponsoring terrorism, the consequences of which have spread well beyond our region,” she said.
Through Gambhir, India reiterated its stand that Pakistan is a terror state, and that terrorists designated by the United Nations continued to roam Pakistan’s streets freely and operate with State support.
“With the approval of authorities, many terrorist organisations raise funds openly in flagrant violation of Pakistan’s international obligations,” she said, adding that while Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation record is marked by “deception and deceit,” it talks about restraint, renunciation and peace.
Referring to Nawaz Sharif’s mention of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a youth leader, Gambhir said: “Even today we have heard support by the Prime Minister of Pakistan for a self-acknowledged commander of a known terrorist organisation.” Read more here

Mothers and widows of soldiers martyred in the September 18 Uri attack kept weeping inconsolably as audience welcomed them with standing ovation at a felicitation function function at Bharat Diamond Bourse. All 19 families, whose sons were killed in the Uri attack, received a fixed deposit of 10 lakhs each from diamond traders and jewellers on Thursday.
The Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association disbursed the FDs to the 19 martyrs’ families through the hands of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his wife Amruta. A total of Rs 1.9 crore was distributed.

On the occasion, Fadnavis said, “Though these families have lost their son’s, events like this show the entire nation is standing with them. I salute the mothers who gave birth to these bravehearts.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He added, “Our army is one of the best in the world. They always had the potential to eradicate terrorist camps, all they needed was a 56-inch chest to back them and give them a free hand. Which we all know resulted in the surgical strike. I hope by now Pakistan would have learnt a lesson that we will now retaliate.”
Wives and mothers of these 19 Martyrs have still not come out of the shock. Parvati Devi, wife of Martyr Lance nayak Rajesh Yadav gave birth to her third child on October 1. She was named Divya as decided by her deceased father. She even had to be rushed to the hospital on Wednesday for weakness.
Devram Thok , father of Sepoy Sandeep Thok and resident of Nasik said, “ I always pestered my sons to take me to Mumbai as I heard alot about the city from my friends. I came to Mumbai for the first time today to attend the felicitation function of dead son.”
Apart from the CM, Diamond merchant and bollywood financer Bharat Shah, Pravin Shankar Pandya- Chairman of Gems & Jewellery national relief foundation, MMRDA commissioner UPS Madan were present at the event."

The Congress Party on Monday demanded the Narendra Modi government to convene a special Parliament session to discuss the security situation in India post the Uri attack, where terrorists killed 18 Army personnel. Congress also demanded that Pakistan must be declared as a terrorist state and rescind its Most Favoured Nation status. Imposing economic sanctions against the neighbouring country was also mooted by the Congress. “Pakistan should be declared a terrorist state immediately, a special Parliament session should also be called,” said Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi.
The demand comes at a time when Prime Minister Modi chaired a meeting to study the Indus Waters Treaty, signed by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru with Pakistan. In the wake of the Uri attack, there have been calls on revisiting the treaty by India to apply pressure on Pakistan. Water Ministry officials gave a detailed presentation to Modi on the implications of abrogating the treaty, sources told news agency ANI. The treaty gives Pakistan access to the western rivers — Jhelum, Indus and Chenab — and India has control on the eastern rivers, Ravi, Sutluj and Beas.

On Monday, Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj is set to raise the terrorism issue in her speech at the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly. She is likely to give a stinging reply to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech on the Kashmir issue. The prime minister also blamed Pakistan for exporting terrorism across its borders in his speech at the BJP National Conclave in Kozikhode. He challenged Pakistan to combat poverty and raise the standard of living in the country, instead of pushing terrorists across the border. Sharif, in his speech at the UN, said that Pakistan would share a dossier with the UN General Secretary Ban ki-Moon on the alleged human rights violation in Kashmir.

He demanded a free and fair plebiscite to allow Kashmiris to decide whether they want freedom from India.  Sharif also hailed Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, who was killed by security forces in Kashmir."

National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Friday convened an all-party meeting over Kashmir and discussed the prevailing situation in the Valley which has crippled normal life for more than three months.
Pressing for peace between India and Pakistan, Farooq Abdullah said, “We are only interested in peace, India and Pakistan must sit down and resolve their issues.”

He said, “I don’t want to say anything on Uri attack. I just want to save this state. I want peace. (Mujhe Uri hamle pe kuch nahi kehna, mujhe sirf is riyaasat ko bachaana hai. Aman aur shaanti chahiye)https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The National Conference President further said, “Remember what Vajpayee ji said-‘we can’t choose our neigbours’, so we have to talk to Pakistan, there is no other option”.  “We are concerned about peace, we don’t care about surgical strikes. Indian and Pakistan must sit down at a table to talks”, he added.
Normal life in Kashmir has been affected for the past 98 days due to protests and clashes which erupted after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces on July 8."

(File photo)
Asserting a war was not an option between India and Pakistan, Sri Lanka on Wednesday said cross-border terrorism was a core issue on the table for SAARC and the members of eight-nation grouping have to discuss it and its impact before moving forward.
Interacting with media after talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on key regional and bilateral issues including security situation in the region, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also stressed that even if SAARC falls apart, cross-border terrorism will not end so India has to see how to move forward in dealing with it.

“Cross-border terrorism is on the table. SAARC has to look at it and discuss what has happened (cancellation of the SAARC meet). How we are going to handle it…SAARC has to decide on two issues — cross-border terrorism and areas in which we can work together.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If we don’t do it, there is no future for SAARC,” he said while noting that in last few years, nothing has moved in the grouping due to friction between two India and Pakistan.
Asked about his reaction on the possibility of military escalation between India and Pakistan in view of the Uri attack, the Lankan PM said, “I don’t think war is an option for anyone” and observed that Modi has taken a lot of steps to diffuse the tension.
On why Sri Lanka was late in its response on holding of SAARC meet in Islamabad and was not categoric in condemning Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism like Bangladesh and Afghanistan, he said Afghanistan and Bangladesh had a problem of their own internal security which was not the case with Sri Lanka, but Colombo did say that the atmosphere was not conducive for the meet."

The Uri terror attack that left 17 Army personnel dead and 20 injured early on Sunday morning has invited condemnation  and solidarity for India from the international community.
Four heavily armed terrorists sneaked into the administrative buildings and store complex of an infantry battalion in Uri, home of the 12 Infantry Brigade, near the Line of Control (LoC).
The four terrorists were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle, and a combing operation was underway. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the Uri militant attack in Kashmir. “The United Nations is following developments closely and shares the concerns of people living in the region for peace,” a statement issued by Ban’s spokesperson here said.
Earlier on Sunday, UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson spoke to External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi. He condemned the terror attack adding that UK stands shoulder to shoulder with India in defeating terrorism.
John Kirby, Assistant Secretary and State Department spokesperson said in the statement released by the US embassy in New Delhi, “The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on an Indian army base in Kashmir during the early morning of September 18. We extend our condolences to the victims and their families. The United States is committed to our strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism.”
US ambassador to India, Richard Verma, also “strongly condemned” the Uri attack. “We strongly condemn the terror attack in Uri, J&K. Our

thoughts are with the families of the brave soldiers who lost their lives #UriAttack,” he tweeted.

Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as the head of the Non-Aligned Movement, also expressed solidarity with the people of India “who have suffered a terrorist attack.”
“We are committed along with our brotherly people of the world to get into the depth of this problem that has generated proliferation of terrorist movements, which doesn’t respect life and the need for coexistence of people,” he said at a press conference after the NAM summit in Margarita Island on Sunday.
The UN is preparing to hold its annual general assembly in New York, where Kashmir is likely to come onto the agenda amid concerns that India’s tough rhetoric could herald a military escalation between the old foes."

Buoyed by BJP’s win in civic elections and bypolls, party chief Amit Shah on Tuesday said it showed people’s support for Prime Minister’s demonetization move and claimed some opposition leaders were upset as their money “looted” in scams has turned into trash. “While opposition is organising Bharat bandh and Akrosh Divas,… every where BJP posted unprecedented victory. People are with the government’s decision on demonetization,” he said at party’s parivartan rally in Maharajganj, referring to victories in bypolls in Assam and Madhya Pradesh and civic polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Watch what else is in the news

“Poor do not have black money…Rahul baba, Akhilesh babu, behen Mayawati…it is the one that was lying with you all that has been lost…what will happen now…those who are caught with black money will lose 50 per cent and this money will be put in the treasury of the country,” Shah said at the election rally.
The polls result favouring BJP showed that people of the country support demonetization, he said and promised that any illgotten money deposited in banks will go into government treasury so that it can be used for the welfare of the poor.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Stepping up attack on parties opposing demonetization, Shah said certain leaders were angry with demonetization as all the wealth accumulated by them is gone due to a single stroke of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“SP, BSP, Congress, Mamata (Banerjee), (Arvind) Kejriwal are all angry with Narendra Modi today. Do you know why this is so…what was amassed through loot has been turned into ‘raddi’ (trash) by Modiji on November 8,” he said
“Modiji has announced that those depositing large amounts in their accounts like Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore … the looted money will be used for welfare of the poor,” he said.
His remarks came in the wake of passage of a bill in Lok Sabha to amend Income Tax Act to impose tax on deposits made post-demonetization.
The Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, 2016, provides for paying 50 per cent tax on unaccounted deposits, or 85 per cent if caught.
“For ten years those amassing trillions of rupees in their homes through scams are today angry with Modi,” Shah alleged said.
“Till the morning of November 8, they all used to ask Modiji, what have you done against black money and today they are asking why have you done this,” he said.
“The country is with Modiji… it is in favour of the decision of demonetization,” he stressed.
Striking a dialogue with the audience, he asked whether they supported the decision of demonetization or ‘bua-bhatija’, a reference to BSP chief Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.
Over the last few days, BJP won one Lok Sabha seat each in Assam and Madhya Pradesh besides bagging a number of assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh.
The saffron party also emerged victorious in local bodies polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Shah alleged that fake notes had made their way into India during 10 years of UPA rule.
Hitting out at Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his ‘khoon ki dalali’ remark on surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah said Modi government took action within ten days of the Uri attack unlike the previous Congress-led government “but Congress shehzada (prince) says Modiji indulges in ‘khoon ki dalali'”.
“Rahul baba how will you know the value of army jawans’ bravery…how will you know the value of their sacrifice…it is invaluable,” he said, claiming that no one can dare touch the boundaries of the country under the BJP government."

Union minister Prakash Javadekar Saturday said incidents like the attack on an Army patrol in Kashmir by terrorists were part of tactics by Pakistan, which knew it could not fight and win a conventional war with India.
“There are no two opinions. Pakistan knows that they cannot defeat India. They cannot fight a war against India and therefore what they are doing is, it is their strategy. But it will be defeated, even as they are isolated in the international forum,” he told reporters here. Javadekar was replying to a query on terrorists opening fire on a patrol party of the Indian Army in Tral township of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district earlier in the day. The Pakistani army also fired mortars and automatic weapons along Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district, where two persons were killed and three injured.
Javadekar said the nation believes in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and recalled his warning after the Uri terror attack that it will not be forgotten and the sacrifice of 18 jawans will not go in vain.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“In the light of what Pakistan has been doing, including the beheading of two soldiers by Pakistan’s special forces along LoC, our Prime Minister had made it clear (after the Uri attack) that the sacrifice of the soldiers will not go in vain.”
“The nation believes in the Prime Minister,” he said. He was also asked about Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of “spying”.
Javadekar said External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and others were looking into the matter. “Also, we have won the international court verdict.” The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stayed the execution of Jadhav following India’s submission that he was kidnapped from Iran where he was involved in business after retiring from the Navy."

The assertion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that those behind the terror attack at an Army base in Uri in Kashmir “will not go unpunished” on Sunday triggered considerable speculation about the options that India could exercise in the current situation. A swift, surgical strike on terror camps in Pakistan- occupied Kashmir(PoK) was among the options that figured in the speculation but experts also cautioned against consequences and the damages that an escalation could pose if it goes out of hand.
How, when and where perpetrators of the Uri attack which was attributed to Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM could be “punished” was a call for the country’s political leadership to be taken very carefully, experts felt, although BJP’s points-man for Jammu and Kashmir Ram Madhav asserted that days of strategic restraint are over and suggested that “for one tooth, the complete jaw” should be the policy after the strike.

“Perpetrators of Uri terror attack shall be punished…,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Some retired army generals also favoured a tough response from India. Expressing outrage over the attack on an army battalion in Uri, the former generals sought urgent action against Pakistan, including keeping the “military option open” to deal with terror from its soil.
“We must have our military option open, if required to strike at certain places,” Lt Gen (Retd) B S Jaswal said. “Bring pickets, which have launch pad to the ground, raze them to the ground. The reason is that till the time it does not hurt Pakistan physically, they would not respect our decency,” Jaswal, who was GOC-in-C of the Northern Command, said.
“Pakistan keeps doing it (terror strikes) again and again knowing that we would not take any action,” Major (Retd) Gaurav Arya, who has expertise in Jammu and Kashmir security situation, said. The problems in Kashmir are “systematically manufactured” at the GHQ in Rawalpindi, he alleged, adding “We must take immediate action. Stop trade with Pakistan, downgrade (its) Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. The world must know we are serious.”

Questioning the absence of two service chiefs at the meeting chaired by Home Minister Rajnath Singh to take stock of the situation after the attack, former army chief Gen Shankar Roy Chowdhury said these actions were coming from Pakistan. Retired Brigadiar Anil Gupta accused Pakistan of causing instability in the Valley.
He said the attack was “a matter of serious concern for India and is a desperate attempt by Pakistan to ensure the current turmoil in Kashmir doesn’t end.” Lt Gen (Retd) Syed Ata Hasnain said “preventing suicide attack is difficult, but damage control is always possible.”"

Amid slogans in his praise by thousands of emotional villagers and family members, the mortal remains of Army jawan Sandip Somnath Thok, who was martyred in the Uri terror attack, were consigned to flames at his native place in Nashik. The body of 24-year-old Sandip, who is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters, was yesterday brought to Ojhar Airport in Nashik district in an

IAF plane from Srinagar and then taken to his native Khadangli village by road last night.
His parents, relatives and villagers broke down on seeing the valiant soldier’s body. A procession was also taken out in the village as state

Rural Development Minister Dadaji Bhuse, District Collector Radhakrishnan B, Sub-Divisional Officer Mahesh Patil, Tehsildar Manoj Khairnar and others paid rich tributes to the martyr. Sandip, whose father Somnath is an onion farmer, had joined the Army in 2014 after repeated attempts. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces. The jawan was bid farewell amid chants of ‘Bharat Mata

Ki Jai’ and ‘Sandeep Thok Amar Rahein’ by grief-stricken villagers as his mortal remains were cremated late last night with full military honours.
Besides Sandip, three other bravehearts from Maharashtra — Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati — were among the 18 jawans killed in the Uri terror attack.

Heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM, had on Sunday stormed an Army base at Uri in Kashmir, killing 18 jawans."

Excitement is brewing on Karan Johar’s exclusive chat show, Koffee With Karan. While recently it was rumoured that Karan will host Bollywood’s real-life couple Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna on his show, now we have got another electrifying gossip about Karan’s celeb guests.
What if we tell you that the show is all set to host two heartthrobs of the B’town? Oh yes, if reports are to be believed then Varun Dhawan and Arjun Kapoor are going to be on the show and reports are even suggesting that they may be the first guests!

KJo has every now and then spoke about his fondness for Varun Dhawan and how he treats him like his own kid ever since he made his acting debut with ‘Student Of The Year’. And Arjun Kapoor, who is a close friend of Varun Dhawan, is probably coming over to boost the promotions of his upcoming film, Half Girlfriend. Tanuj Garg from Balaji Telefilms took to Twitter to announce the news. He shared a picture of Varun and Arjun with a caption that read, “This is going to be fun ! Two mad favs together on #KoffeeWithKaran ! Make sure you serve it strong, KJo !”
However, there is no confirmation on the news as of yet. Till now, apart from Twinkle and Akshay, the rumours were rife that the show will host Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan on the premiere episode. Before that, it was said to be a cert that Fawad Khan was likely to be the first guest on the show. However, after the Uri attack and a ban on Pakistani artistes, those plans have been shelved.
The rumours are doing their jobs of generating curiosity around the show but even the channel isn’t leaving any stone unturned. The channel, on its official YouTube channel and on Facebook, has been sharing teasers from the show, which definitely promises a grilling yet fun chat show ahead.

The Indian Air Force has ‘categorically rejected’ Pakistani claims of its jet fighters flying over Siachen. Pakistan Chief of Air Staff Sohail Aman was on Wednesday quoted saying that all forward bases of its Air Force was made operational. Pakistani media reported that PAF jets flew near Siachen as part of war exercises. The Air Chief was also reported to have taken part in the exercises by flying the Mirage jet himself. “The nation should not worry about the enemy’s statements…we are peace loving people but are ready to face all kinds of challenges,” Air Chief Marshal Aman was quoted saying by The News International. He was talking to reporters at the Qadri airbase in Skardu, where he also reviewed the exercises and operational preparedness of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).

In a separate statement to Radio Pakistan, Marshal Aman was also quoted as saying that Pakistan will give a befitting response to any misadventure by the enemy. “Our response to any aggression by the enemy will be such that their future generations will also remember it,” he said according to the report.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Pakistani Air Chief’s comments come a day after the Indian Army released a video of ‘punitive fire assaults’ on Pakistani posts in the Naushera sector of the Line of Control as part of its counter-terrorism operations. The video showed Pakistani posts on a ridge being destroyed by 84 mm rocket launchers, anti-tank guided missiles and 106 mm recoilless guns. This is the first time that the Army officially released a video claiming destruction of Pakistan Army bunkers.
Major General Ashok Narula, Additional Director General of Public Information, told The Indian Express, “Infiltrations are likely to increase with melting of snow and opening of passes. Operations like Naugam where four terrorists were neutralised on 20-21 May are the instances. This calls for even more pro-active counter-terrorism operations.”
Tensions between the two nuclear-powered neighbours have mounted ever since the attack on an Indian army base in Uri in September last year. At least 18 soldiers were killed by militants based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Uri attack prompted India to launch ‘surgical strikes’ across the LoC to destroy terror launchpads nearly 10 days after the attack on the India soil."

The Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Kranti Dal, a “non-political organisation” that aims to “combat evils in society”, on Wednesday, added the cancellation of Pakistani singer Atif Aslam’s concert to its list of “achievements”. The concert was to be held in Gurgaon’s Leisure Valley Park on October 15.
Hours after members of the Dal held a meeting with Gurgaon Deputy Commissioner TL Satyaprakash, the district administration sent out a message requesting the organisers of the event to “defer” the concert, “considering the sentiments of armed forces/ soldiers at the frontier”.

The organiser of the event, however, claimed the concert had been cancelled last week in view of the tense relations between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Kranti Dal, which says it has over 32,000 workers across 14 states, including Haryana, Odisha, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat, prides itself on advocating the cause of the “Hindu nation” by taking up such issues. Established in 1999 by “seven people keen to work for the country” and promote the “Hindu cause”, the Dal focuses on 14 issues, including curbing atrocities on women, with measures such as helping “poor women” get married and eliminating the “curse of dowry”.
Among the issues the group has taken up is that of assisting Indian soldiers. The Dal recently started a website called ‘Blood For Nation’ to promote a campaign called “Khoon Ko Tilak Karo”. For the campaign, it invites people to register their details online if they are willing to give blood to soldiers, so that they can be contacted when needed.
“We opened registration two days ago and have already got 5,000 volunteers. As awareness about the campaign increases, we expect this number will rise and soon reach our target of 1 lakh,” Rajeev Mittal, national general secretary of the Dal and one of its founders, said Thursday.
One of the main causes of the Dal is “protection of the cow mother” through the establishment of the Gau Raksha Dal, which focuses on “preventing the murder of cows”. The Gau Raksha Dal’s Gurgaon wing, headed by Dharmendra Yadav, recently hit the headlines after a video of its members force-feeding panchgavya (cow dung concoction) to two cattle traders, who they had caught, came to light.
The Dal lays emphasis on patriotism, seeing it also as a way to curb terrorism, and cites this as the reason why it opposed the Atif Aslam concert. “We are not against art or artistes, but this country is waging war on our borders and killing our soldiers. If their (Pakistani) people work in the spirit of friendship, would we not respect their artistes and their soldiers? We have a problem with their questionable intentions and their wrong thinking,” said Mittal.
This concert, however, is not the first event in Gurgaon to be cancelled because of opposition by groups to involvement of Pakistani artistes. A performance by the Sabri brothers last year was called off after Shiv Sena members reportedly warned the organisers to replace the Pakistan-based group with Indian artistes. A replacement was done, but the organisers claimed this was done because of visa issues."

In 2011, then a Flight Lieutenant who flew a Sukhoi fighter jet, Abhinandan Varthaman was asked in a TV documentary: What makes a good pilot? “Bad attitude,” he said, amid peals of laughter from fellow pilots.
Eight years later, Wing Commander Abhinandan has emerged as the face of the Indo-Pak tension in the past fortnight following the February 14 Pulwama terrorist attack and the February 26 Balakot air strike. With Islamabad handing him over in two days as a “peace gesture”, after Delhi had ruled out any negotiation, Abhinandan had possibly spent the shortest stint as an Indian pilot in Pakistani captivity. This was long after the 1965 war when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Ayub Khan had offered General K M Cariappa the release of his son, K C Cariappa, a downed pilot, within a day, but General Cariappa had refused saying he didn’t want special favours. He was released after four months.

This fortnight, from Pulwama to Balakot, marked a milestone in India’s retaliatory response to terror. But it were 12 long days fraught with risks.
***https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Recalling the shock of the Pulwama attack on February 14 afternoon, a senior officer said, “The nature and scale were something like seen in Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria.” What magnified it was that the CRPF men who were hit were a “pan-Indian” unit — its 40 deceased coming from 10 states. Public outrage was hence spread across, and the government was apprehensive of the fallout.

In his meeting with the top brass the next day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is learnt to have told officers: “Jawab toh dena padega. Par aap behtar jaante hain kya-kya kar sakte hain (We need to give a response. But you know better what all can be done).”

The surgical strikes after the Uri attack in 2016 had been a template, but with Pulwama having come despite that and extracting a larger toll, it called for a bigger response. The security establishment wanted a strike leaving a visible impact on Jaish-e-Mohammad.
As discussions went on over the next week, an officer privy to the talks said, “Every single option was on the table.” From recalling envoys to cutting off or downgrading diplomatic ties between Delhi and Islamabad by reducing staff strength, cutting trade ties including MFN status withdrawal to snapping sports links, stopping visas to cancelling LoC trade, stopping Samjhauta Express and Delhi-Lahore bus services to cancelling all meetings including the Kartarpur talks — a full spectrum of response was considered. The government went on to implement some of these measures, such as withdrawal of MFN status.

Stressing that there were no naysayers, the officer added, “The intent was clear from the top that Pakistan needs to be punished.” Even Ministry of External Affairs officers, who normally advocate restraint and diplomacy, were animated about a retaliation.
India also considered sharing a dossier of evidence with Pakistan, but many in South Block felt that would not yield anything. It was pointed out that Pakistan was distancing itself from the attack despite a Jaish video claiming responsibility. “Pakistan was in a state of denial from Day one”, an official said.

An officer said the Modi government had also burnt its hands with the Pathankot episode. “We had given access to one of our forward bases to Pakistan’s military after the attack, apart from sharing evidence. But they disappointed us.” Delhi had the same experience after the Mumbai terror attack.
On the military side, the possibility of a limited conflict — limited in time and space, with quick outcomes within established time frames — was considered. Officials felt the action had to be “cinematic” but also “militarily effective”, “inflicting pain” on Pakistan. The government was also clear that the punitive action should not be knee-jerk and not swayed by public opinion. “There were no impossible demands made of us,” a senior defence official said.
As PM Modi publicly declared that he had given full freedom to the Indian forces to respond, the understanding within the higher echelons was that the time frame should be six weeks from the Pulwama terror attack.
***
Meanwhile, the MEA was tasked to “prepare the international environment” for a military option. “The political dial was spinning, so the diplomatic dial was also spinning,” in an official’s words.
Joint Secretaries in charge of territorial divisions in the MEA started working their phones. While India had deployed such “coercive diplomacy” after the Uri attack in 2016 and the Mumbai attack in 2008 as well, the effort this time was unprecedented in scale.
The first tweet on the incident came from US Ambassador Kenneth Juster as early as 7.42 pm on February 14 — hours after the attack. Juster expressed condolences and said the US “strongly condemns” the attack. “The United States stands alongside India in confronting terror and defeating it,” he tweeted, signing off with #KashmirTerrorAttack.

Working through the night, officials urged other ambassadors as well to either issue statements or ask their foreign ministries — if they were awake and available — to do so. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale held fort over the next few days, summoning Pakistan envoy Sohail Mahmood, meeting ambassadors of P-5 countries, envoys of South Asian neighbours and a majority of the G-20 countries.
Over the next few days, all P-5 countries, and all South Asian neighbours, and strategic partners, issued statements condemning the attack. The big gains were statements from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Turkey and Iran, all major partners of Pakistan who routinely support Islamabad on the Kashmir issue. By the time of the Balakot strike, India had got condemnation statements from more than 110 countries in 12 days.
But Delhi knew it may not be enough. In his book The People Next Door: The curious history of India’s relations with Pakistan, T C A Raghavan, former Indian envoy to Pakistan, wrote, “Diplomacy as a means to induce Pakistan’s action against the planners of the attack had its limits, and these were revealed in the aftermath of 26/11 as older anxieties and paranoia about India asserted themselves in Pakistan.”

At that juncture, in a significant signal to New Delhi as well as the international community, US National Security Advisor John Bolton supported India’s “right to self-defence” against cross-border terrorism, in his phone conversation with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval. The underlying message was a nod to a retaliatory strategic response by India, including military.
This was different from the conversation the Obama Administration’s NSA, Susan Rice, had with Doval in September 2016, after the Uri attack. Then, the message was to exercise restraint, even as Pakistan was asked to act against terror outfits.
Another big breakthrough came when China, after a week of diplomatic wrangling, signed on the dotted line of a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) statement that “condemned in the strongest terms” the Pulwama terror attack and named Jaish for the “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing”. The statement was significant because China has singlehandedly blocked the listing of Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the UNSC for the last 10 years, thrice at Pakistan’s behest. After the Balakot attack, US, UK and France moved a proposal to list Azhar again.

The UNSC statement was the first time a terrorist attack in J&K had been condemned by the UN body. The UN considers J&K disputed territory, and has been unable to come to a consensus on the definition of terrorism. As a result, it has never been involved in past terrorist attacks in Kashmir.
“Uncle Sam took the lead,” an Indian official told The Sunday Express, saying the US had done the heavylifting to pursuade China to come on board.
It was nearly a week after Pulwama though that the UNSC statement came, though South Block had hoped for one in two days — like after the 26/11 attack or Parliament attack. Explaining the reason for this delay, an official said that China wanted UNSC members to use UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s language, which was part of his spokesperson’s statement on Day One: “We strongly condemn today’s attack in Jammu and Kashmir Pulwama district….” But Delhi wanted stronger language. So, on February 19, Guterres’s spokesperson said: “We’re deeply concerned at the increase in tensions between the two countries in the wake of the attack on Indian security personnel on 14 February in Pulwama.”

China initially wanted a mention as Indian-administered Kashmir, but remaining P-5 countries prevailed upon Beijing.
So, the language had changed from “attack in Jammu and Kashmir” to “attack on Indian security personnel”. “That made the difference,” an official said, adding that Beijing soon came on board. “China also agreed to name Jaish in the statement as they wanted to cut their losses. Sometimes you take a decision to gain something, sometimes you don’t want to waste political capital on something like this,” a source said.
The change in China’s stance also meant clarity on one of the uncertainties surrounding the escalation ladder — how Beijing would respond if a military option was exercised. The sense in Delhi was that China was also worried about terrorism on its soil, and hence had a better understanding of the challenge.
New Delhi also believed that Beijing would not react negatively as long as Chinese interests, including its infrastructure, and personnel who are part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, were not targeted. “Any limited, coercive action, that does not hamper Chinese interests, would not invite retaliation from China,” a South Block official said.
***
Having created an international environment against Pakistan, India had three military options — surgical strikes by special forces, air strikes and shallow conventional thrust.
While surgical strikes lacked the surprise element after Uri, shallow conventional thrust had the potential of leading to a more prolonged and protracted conflict. Hence air strikes were decided as the most effective option.
But there were many challenges to this too. US or NATO strikes in Afghanistan are generally carried out in sparsely populated, semi-urban areas, unlike the location of the Jaish headquarters in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. Other targets around urban centres like Karachi or Lahore were also densely populated.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-5587722"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg"" alt="""" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg?resize=450,250 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg?resize=600,334 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg?resize=728,405 728w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/pulwama-attack-759.jpg?resize=150,83 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> Budgam: Tricolor draped coffins of the CRPF personnel, who lost their lives in Thursday’s Pulwama terror attack, during wreath laying ceremony at the CRPF camp in Budgam, Friday, Feb 15, 2019.

Discussions then began on how to choose a target that would cause little collateral damage and avoided civilian casualties. Also, care had to be taken to hit no Pakistani soldiers or military installations or economic infrastructure — which could escalate the stand-off. Indian establishment was able to gather reasonably good intelligence on this, and finally zeroed in on Balakot, located on a hilltop in a forested area, away from military installations and a civilian population.
So, less than a fortnight after the attack, in the wee hours of February 26, India conducted air strikes deep inside Pakistan — the first time after the 1971 war.
The world got the first inkling of the attack around 5.12 am, when Pakistan Army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor tweeted: “Indian Air Force violated Line of Control. Pakistan Air Force immediately scrambled. Indian aircrafts gone back. Details to follow.” By 5.15 am, a mid-level Indian diplomat had seen it.
In its announcement at 11.30 am, India said it had struck the “biggest training camp” of Jaish, in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), killing “a very large number” of Jaish terrorists and their trainers. The government fielded the Foreign Secretary to announce the strike rather than a military official (the Director General of Military Operations had announced, for example, the surgical strikes after Uri), to convey that it was a counter-terror operation, and not a military operation.
***
A top official told The Sunday Express, “By striking in KPK, India made the LoC and the International Border irrelevant when it comes to cross-border strikes.” According to him, “More than the casualty numbers and damage, what matters most is that you were able to hit them inside their country, and that is a huge strategic achievement.”

India also noted in its statement that it had chosen “non-military” targets, and that the strikes were “pre-emptive” as the Jaish was planning another hit.
Till now, the official noted, the Indian establishment’s response to such situations has been marked with reflection and restraint. It is mindful of global opinion, and prefers giving diplomacy a chance. The Balakot strike, he said, “…showed the intent that if you hit us, we will hit back, inside your territory. And, this will be limited to not just PoK, it can go beyond to other provinces of Pakistan. The idea is to instil some sort of fear in the minds of the Pakistani establishment.”
According to sources, a senior official declared at the government war room in Delhi that terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar would not be able to sleep peacefully at night now. “Because, you never know what the Indians will do,” he told fellow officers.
The Indian calculation had factored in a Pakistan retaliation. While many warned the escalation ladder between the two nuclear-armed countries couldn’t be predicted, Delhi’s sober assessment was that Pakistan would not use nuclear weapons, considering the international outrage that would follow and how India might retaliate. Delhi also assessed that given Islamabad’s economic and political realities — it has barely US $8 billion forex reserves and is looking for an IMF bailout — it would not be able to go in for an all-out war.
“See, Pakistan is an army with a country. They would have hit back for a face-saver, so we were prepared,” an officer said.
On February 27, over 20 Pakistani aircraft breached the LoC and launched laser-guided bombs. Contrary to the Pakistan Army’s claims of having “rocks and trees” — to keep the tensions simmering but low — they actually narrowly missed Indian military targets. Delhi was quick to call it an “act of aggression”, and claim that while it was not looking at escalation and had conducted a “non-military counter-terror pre-emptive” strike, Pakistan had tried to hit Indian military installations.

Also, in the dogfight, while one Pakistani aircraft was shot down, India too lost a fighter jet with Abhinandan getting captured in PoK.
As India pressed for its pilot to be returned, Islamabad dialled major countries, including the P-5, and claimed Delhi was planning three offensive actions. It claimed movement of Naval ships towards Karachi, a plan to launch ballistic missiles, and amassing of troops along the India-Pak border.
Rattled, the foreign governments reached out to New Delhi. The Indian side told them this was “fictitious and manufactured”. In fact, they said, Indian Naval ships were moving away from Karachi, and this fact could be verified by them themselves.
Soon, Islamabad found itself isolated, with none of the P-5 countries backing it and many asking Pakistan to act against the terrorist groups. It also found itself at the receiving end of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where it is still on grey list, and that drives away potential investors to the country.
The UAE too snubbed Pakistan’s demand that the Organisation of Islamic Countries withdraw its first-ever invitation to India after a 1969 fiasco.
With the P-5 countries, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE leaning on Pakistan, Islamabad had few options. The assessment in Delhi is that the Pakistan Air Force’s action in India was meant by PM Imran Khan for his domestic audience, while releasing Abhinandan gives the Pakistani army a chance to portray itself as a professional force. Imran’s announcement on Abhinandan’s release prompted India to dial down too.
“Pakistan used the limited elbow room they had. Just like they had announced the Kartarpur corridor and forced India to reciprocate, this time as well, they forced India to de-escalate,” said an Indian diplomat.
A statement by the Indian tri-services military that they were in a “state of readiness” but would not escalate any further also brought relief to not just Pakistan but to the international community as well.
***
But even as Abhinandan came home, what was clear was that the strategic red line between India and Pakistan had moved decisively. Pakistan had been clearly conveyed that India “reserves the right to take firm and decisive action to protect its national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity against any act of aggression or cross-border terrorism”.
In his book Choices, former NSA Shivshankar Menon, in his concluding paragraph in the chapter on 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, wrote, “Lastly, personalities matter. With a different mix of people at the helm, it is quite possible that India would have chosen differently. In fact, if India is forced to make a similar choice in the future, I am sure it will respond differently.”
A top official told The Sunday Express that with Balakot, the Modi government had created a template for future governments to come, irrespective of their political affiliation. Said an official, who has worked closely with the UPA government and now with the Modi government, “This was unlike the Manmohan Singh government, where there would be naysayers and discussions and debate. Once the top brass had decided to act, everyone was supposed to implement.”
But, for Delhi, the touchtone remains the demand that Pakistan show credible, verifiable action in its crackdown on terrorist groups, their proxies, their infrastructure and cross-border terrorism. To that effect, the detailed Jaish dossier was handed over to Pakistan.
Given the long and complicated nature of India-Pakistan conflict, it is also clear India can’t depend on aggressive posture alone. With Pakistan desperately trying to correct its international image and making peace initiatives, any government would also require to think on its feet."

As New Delhi took a hard look at the MFN (most favoured nation) status to Pakistan, cross-LoC trade, closed for the last three months, resumed in Uri, where an Army installation was attacked by terrorists on September 18.
Cross-LoC trade was suspended after protests erupted in Kashmir over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in an encounter on July 8. The ensuing violence and curfew made it difficult for traders on both sides of the LoC to dispatch their goods.
But on Tuesday, 12 trucks carrying embroidery items, handicraft and spices left from the Salamabad trade centre in Uri to Chikoti in PoK, while one truck carrying dry fruit items arrived in Uri from PoK.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The vehicles crossed the LoC around 1 pm in the presence of senior Army and civil administration officials from both sides.
Custodian, cross-LoC trade, Farooq Ahmad Shah told The Indian Express that the trade will continue for the next three days. “We had a meeting with officials from PoK at zero point this afternoon and the trade crossing took place at 1 pm at Kaman bridge,” Shah said.
“The other side wanted trade to resume. We initiated the process at a meeting chaired by Deputy Commissioner, Baramulla, recently. The decision to resume trade was communicated to officials from the other side of the LoC,” Shah said.
“Due to tension in Uri, many traders were sceptical (on the first day), but from tomorrow, I hope the frequency of trucks will go up,” Shah said, adding that cross-LoC trade will help defuse tension in Uri.
Hilal Turki, general secretary of the cross-LoC trade union, said, “We had taken a decision to resume trade last week, but after the Uri attack, it was deferred.”
Cross-LoC trade is among the confidence building measures initiated by India and Pakistan after the start of the Karvan-e-Aman or Peace Bus on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road. There are 800 registered traders and trade is currently conducted using the barter system."

Hence, everyone will condemn the Uri attack.
Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali has come forward as the first artiste from the neighbouring country to condemn the Uri terror attack. Pakistani artistes, working in Bollywood, have been at the centre of a storm since the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) threatened them to leave India in the wake of the attack and also demanded a ban on them from working in the film industry. The silence of the artistes on the attack has been questioned and criticised in India.
Shafqat, whose concert in Benguluru was scrapped last month after the terror strike, told a news channel, “It is a terror attack and I condemn it, I strongly condemn it.”
When asked why other Pakistani artistes haven’t condemned the attack, the singer said, “As far as I know, Pakistani actors condemn any kind of attack which happens in any part of the world which is against any country because we have been suffering for so many years.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We know how it feels when your soldier or civilian dies. So, I don’t think any of them would say this (Uri) was right.”
The ‘Tere Naina’ singer said when the attack happened there was anger generated towards Pakistani artistes and that pushed them on the backfoot and hence they did not speak on the issue.
“The moment all this started, people started bashing them. Someone also wrote an open letter to Fawad which pushes you on the backfoot and you start thinking ‘What just happened? Why suddenly an open letter to me?’. Ali Zafar, Fawad, Rahat (Fateh Ali Khan) or me, we will condemn a terror attack in any part of the world.”"

Soldiers have again made an appearance on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s promotional posters ahead of the crucial 2017 election. A new poster of the BJP released in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh boasted a silhouetted image of soldiers from 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Screaming Eagles of the US armed forces. The image has also famously appeared as a banner by the famed TV war series Band of Brothers. Notably, the BJP has indirectly kept the Uri terror attack in public discourse but it seems odd that Indian soldiers were not put on the posters, even if the Army’s responding surgical strikes operations are being projected as an achievement by the party.

This poster comes after ‘Avengers of Uri’ posters were seen in Lucknow this month when PM Modi delivered his Dussehra address while also launching the party’s election campaign in the poll-bound state. The Uri attack and surgical strikes carried out subsequently have been used extensively by political outfits in the recent weeks and the BJP’s posters follow in the same line. If not commissioned by the leaders, it was a faux pas seemingly by the party workers trying to impress the PM. Interestingly, the soldiers pictured on the posters are not even Indian to begin with but maybe just put for dramatic effect."

Five-nation group BRICS today agreed to set up an independent rating agency based on market-oriented principles saying it would further strengthen global governance architecture. “We welcome experts exploring the possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles, in order to further strengthen the global governance architecture,” stated the joint declaration issued after the 8th BRICS Summit here.

“In order to further bridge the gap in the global financial architecture, we agreed to fast track the setting up of a BRICS Rating Agency,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement at the conclusion of the BRICS Summit.
The BRICS countries have already set up New Development Bank, which became operational last year, to meet funding requirements of the members.
Batting for a new credit rating agency backed by BRICS group, New Development Bank president K V Kamath had expressed concerns over methodologies of the big three global agencies saying that these are constraining growth in emerging nations.
Kamath had said despite having deep capital buffers, the ratings of multilateral banks like the BRICS-promoted NDB arem affected due to the parent countries’ sovereign ratings.
Citing the case of NDB itself, which is planning to get itself rated for bond-raising in many countries, he had said its rating will be affected because the promoter countries are not AAA-rated.
“We need not constrain ourselves from our ability to do business…if this is the norm, I fear growth in the developing world will also be impacted,” Kamath had said
Kamath comments followed concerns expressed by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) group against the working of the rating market, currently controlled by the Big Three – S&P, Fitch and Moody’s – all based in the US.
This has led the five-member grouping to pursue idea of creating its own independent rating agency, which was discussed during the two-day annual summit.
Earlier, the Exim Bank of India too had made a strong pitch for independent rating agency for the BRICS nations, saying the way the present big three are going about their job reeks of conflict of interest."

The much-awaited Raees is scheduled to release on January 25 and Shah Rukh Khan has made sure that his film hits the screens without any hassle. He recently met Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray and informed him that his co-actor in the film Mahira Khan, a renowned Pakistani actress, will not be asked to come to India for promotions and neither will he work with Pakistani actors in the future.
“There was news in the media for past one week that SRK is going to get Mahira Khan to India for film promotions. So he came here to meet Raj saheb to tell that Mahira Khan is not coming to India for any kind of film promotion and he will also not cast any Pakistani artistes in future,” said Amey Khopkar, an MNS member.
SRK, was obviously taking precautions after the huge controversy MNS created over Fawad Khan’s role in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil a few days after Uri attacks. Khan’s friend Karan Johar had to bow down to the MNS supremo and promised to not work with Pakistani actors again. In fact, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself arranged a meeting between Thackeray and the Producers’ Guild to make peace.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

His decision of meeting Thackeray hasn’t gone down well with many on social media, who believe he couldn’t act as ‘King Khan’ or Chief’ as the name of his film suggests. He is being made fun of and reprimanded for not standing up to the bullying. As indianexpress.com columnist Ujjal Dosanjh wrote in his open letter to SRK titled, “‘King Khan’, you bowed to hate, hate won”, “I never thought you, the King, could succumb to such illegal and unseemly conduct of any goons, let alone the right wing religious fanatic variety.”

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday morning chaired a high-level security review meeting at the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) over the prevailing situation in Jammu and Kashmir post Uri terror attack.
NSA Ajit Doval, Director of Intelligence Bureau, RAW Chief, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, Minister of State in Prime Minister Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh and other senior MHA and MoD officials were in attendance. Yesterday also, the Union Home Minister, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and top security brass of the country had met to review the security situation in the violence-hit state.
After giving an assurance of going after the perpetrators of the deadly Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday gave the green signal to diplomatically isolate Pakistan at every international grouping. In one of the worst attack in recent times, at least 18 soldiers lost their lives and over 20 others got injured post the terror strike on an army camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla district.
Director General of Military operation Lt. Ranbir Singh has said that the four terrorists, who attacked the military base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri, belonged to Pakistan’s banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)."

The Heart of Asia conference scheduled to be held in Amritsar on December 3-4 will be attended by Pakistan’s Sartaj Aziz. However, any formal dialogue between India and Pakistan seems unlikely as both countries have abstained from making any formal request for a bilateral dialogue during the summit. The maximum we may see at the summit are informal talks on the sidelines that are not likely to foster a substantial change in the situation which has strained in the recent past.
The sixth Heart of Asia conference is expected to see attendance of leaders from around 30 countries including US, Russia, China and Iran. The theme will be connectivity and increasing security in and around the Afghan region. The discussions will revolve primarily on peace, cooperation and economic growth in Afghanistan and neighbouring regions. India is the co-chair and host this time and Afghanistan is the permanent chair of the conference. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will lead the Indian delegation in the summit.
India and Pakistan held a formal bilateral dialogue in the last Heart of Asia conference and decided to take the momentum forward in subsequent summits. However, tension has escalated between the two from the start of this year after the Pathankot attack and ceasefire violations in July. The Uri attack and hundreds of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control have left the two neighbours on the edge.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
None of the parties have asked for a bilateral dialogue at the summit and with only two days to go, it is unlikely that one will be placed now. Pakistan has passed the buck to India with Sartaj Aziz, strategist and adviser to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on foreign affairs, claiming that Pakistan is willing to talk but it doesn’t know whether India is willing or not.
After India’s retaliatory surgical strikes, regular terrorist attacks have been carried out in the country with army being the target. Trade has almost stopped. India has led a global isolation campaign against Pakistan.
Not since the Kargil war had tensions between the two neighbours escalated to such levels and it is incumbent upon the diplomatic machinery to find a breakthrough initiate a dialogue.
The ground was laid for a new beginning between the two countries. The establishment in Pakistan–an amalgam of civilian and military leadership with the military dictating security and foreign policy–has changed its texture with civilian government enjoying much more authority. After two decades, General Raheel Sharif has became the first Pakistani Army chief to call it a day on his retirement and hand over his position peacefully to the next General in line. The new Pakistani Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa is thought to be pro-democracy and has been carefully placed by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
However, General Sharif’s effect will take some time to wear off. It is also a fact that Sartaj Aziz is a key cog in the barrel of the establishment and his aggressive manipulations of the civilian Sharif have hurt the chances of a turnaround in relations between India-Pakistan on the diplomatic front for now."

As details of the terrorist attack against the Indian army installation in Uri begin to emerge, hyper-nationalists from both India and Pakistan have transformed social media into a virtual battleground, raising a storm on Facebook and trading verbal gunfire, tweet for tweet. Staggeringly, the narrative that seems to unite both politicians and political observers in Pakistan is that the #UriAttacks were an inside job — meaning Indian forces killed 18 of their own soldiers because India wanted to distract attention from the ongoing terrible human rights violations in the Kashmir valley that Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was going to raise at the UN General Assembly, on September 21.
Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif led the rhetorical bombardment: “Indian Army is massacring Kashmiris; as you sow, so shall you reap. Don’t rule out inside job to malign Azadi movement, by blaming Pakistan.” Asif later told Pakistan’s largest TV channel Geo News that if Pakistan’s security was under threat, it would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons. If only for that comment, perhaps Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should have given him his marching orders. Except, Sharif was already in the US, a weakened and considerably debilitated prime minister compared to his namesake, Pakistan army chief Raheel Sharif.
Meanwhile, Maryam Nawaz Sharif had tweeted her displeasure. Nawaz Sharif’s daughter is an influential voice in the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) — it was for her daughter’s wedding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a surprise visit to the family home in Raiwind, outside Lahore, last December. “Indian officials must address and redress gross human rights violation in IOK (Indian-Occupied Kashmir) instead of levelling unfounded allegations against Pakistan,” Maryam said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sherry Rehman of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party, completed the circle. “Quickest investigation ever points finger at Pakistan,” said Rehman, who runs the well-known thinktank, Jinnah Institute, in Islamabad as well as a successful track two dialogue with India, adding, “War drums over #UriAttacks will not solve anything. There can be no military answer to the diplomatic firestorm between #India-Pakistan.” Could a terror attack be described a “diplomatic firestorm”?
For the time being, at least, the Narendra Modi government seems to have decided to give in to the restraint sought by the international community — even though it reserves the right to take action “at a time of its own choosing”. US President Barack Obama and Modi have struck a close rapport over their several meetings and it seems the Americans are accepting of India’s argument that the roll-call of terror must stop and the “lakshman rekha” must be drawn at Uri. And if India retaliates quietly, by targeting key personnel who are part of the terror food-chain, the US will look the other way.
Certainly, the Uri attacks are as much an attempt to discredit Modi’s ramped-up engagement with the world, as it is to bring the human rights violations in the Kashmir Valley to its notice. Unfortunately, the world has been far too busy with Syria, with Vladimir Putin’s alleged infiltration of the US presidential election and with the yo-yo nature of the election itself to pay close attention to Delhi’s shocking lack of compassion as well as its continuing disinterest in resolving the Kashmir crisis.
Imagine if the Uri attacks were to result in a tit-for-tat response? After all, a large section of the media is baying for Pakistan’s blood, no doubt because blood and gore are great for TRP ratings. Presumably the RSS is too, with none other than the general secretary loaned to the BJP, Ram Madhav, declaring that India must respond with a “jaw for the tooth”. The prime minister himself, when he was chief minister of Gujarat, dismissed the noises made by his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, as so much pacifism.
But as prime minister, Modi finds he is subject to the same restraint that responsible leaders must display. Moreover, if India is to project itself as the region’s leader, with Modi at the helm, he must be in sync with the international community’s unwritten code that these leaders don’t speak loosely about terrorists even if they are allegedly sponsored by nuclear weapon states. Perhaps, the Uri attacks will clarify India’s Pakistan policy in Modi’s mind.
If Pakistan was in the Pacific Ocean, it wouldn’t matter so much. Certainly, Modi is quickly learning — like so many of his predecessors of varying political colours, both Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh — that the buck, at least where India is concerned, stops with the Pakistan army chief, Raheel Sharif, rather than the elected prime minister. Nawaz Sharif was always in danger of being undercut by his own army. Modi’s Raiwind yatra was followed by the Pathankot attack, just as Vajpayee’s Lahore bus journey was followed by the Kargil invasion. India’s inability to distinguish between Sharif’s friendly feelings and the Pakistan army’s more complicated games persuaded Sharif to appease his army at home. The Kashmir crisis, in the wake of the Burhan Wani killing, was an incredible opportunity to return to the limelight. Nawaz Sharif would have been a fool not to take it. Meanwhile, especially with its successful anti-Taliban operations, the Pakistan army was looking better and better each day.
Question is, can Modi pick up where he left off? Can India and Pakistan’s elected prime ministers have a frank conversation about the nature and source of cross-border terror? Can India still help strengthen Nawaz Sharif, knowing that he may be the last man standing willing to take action against those terrorists?
One thing is certain. Once the Pakistan army is gradually cut out of the picture, watch the media narrative change — and Twitter Pakistan with it.

In his book Choices — Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy, former National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon writes that the reason India did not take the route of military retaliation against Pakistan after 26/11 was that there was more to be gained from not falling to that temptation.
In the first place, an Indian military attack on Pakistan would have pushed back the terrorist attack on Mumbai from Pakistani soil, forcing the world to focus on the spectre of war between two nuclear-armed nations; second, it would have united civilian Pakistan behind the Army, whose national image had descended several notches in the newly democratic atmosphere suffused with popular anger over Benazir Bhutto’s assassination.
Explained: Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s statement on Pulwama attack echoes its Army’s line on terrorhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A war with India was exactly what Pakistan wanted to buttress its internal standing. By not playing into the Pakistan Army’s hands, Menon says, India managed to bring international attention to the India-focused terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan — before 26/11, the US was worried only about getting Osama bin Laden and Pakistan-based Taliban groups that were targeting it.
But Menon also noted that should there be another attack from Pakistan, with or without visible backing from the Pakistani state, it would be “virtually impossible” for any government of India to make the same choice again, mainly because of Pakistan’s stubborn refusal to act against the perpetrators of 26/11. “The circumstances of November 2008 no longer exist and are unlikely to be replicated in the future,” he warned.
No visible gain from strikes
Last week’s suicide vehicle-borne IED attack on the CRPF convoy in Kashmir that killed 40 jawans has had an impact on the national psyche almost identical to that of the Mumbai attacks. And as Menon forewarned, the national circumstances are very different than they were 10 years ago — with the BJP in power under a leader who banks on an image of being “strong”, and with elections just weeks away, there are compulsive internal arguments for the government to choose military retaliation. Additionally, India no longer feels obliged not to undermine Pakistan’s civilian government — Prime Minister Imran Khan and his ministers repeatedly declare that the government and Pakistan Army are on the same page.

Yet, even in the changed circumstances of India, Pakistan and the world, it is not clear that India’s top decision-makers are confident that military retaliation will achieve anything of demonstrable benefit for India, even if it does not end up in a full-blown conflict. While escalation could backfire, and damage the government politically, a military option with visible results that can be declared as a success by the political leadership of the country would have to go beyond what India already did after Jaish-e-Mohammad’s attack on the Uri brigade headquarters in September 2016.
The much-publicised surgical strike across the Line of Control, which won the Modi government brownie points among his supporters, yielded no change in the Pakistan Army’s behaviour. Success or failure in a military operation can be gauged only by the strategic objective it sets and meets. Revenge is not a strategic objective. Can India pull off a US-style aerial attack on the Jaish headquarters in Bahawalpur or the LeT headquarters in Muridke? As the US discovered from its drone attacks on Taliban leaders, such attacks, even if successful, would hardly spell an end to the terror infrastructure inside Pakistan. In fact, it could make Pakistan’s support for such groups stronger. Worse, such strikes are sure to cause civilian casualties.

How far does coercion work?
India has been at this juncture several times in the past, and over the last 18 years, short of an all-out war, has tried just about every kind of coercive mechanism in its efforts to induce behaviour change in Pakistan. But the changes, if at all, have been temporary.
In 2001-2002, after Jaish’s attack on Parliament, India mobilised half a million troops to its western border, the largest such build-up since 1971. India seriously considered an air-strike on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, but Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was persuaded to call it off by the US in light of a speech on January 12, 2002, by the then military ruler General Pervez Musharraf, in which he called the attack on Parliament a terrorist act and promised to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. But the Indian and Pakistani armies continued to eyeball each other well into 2002, and India came close to a strike again in May that year, after fidyaeen attackers killed 34 people, mostly family members of soldiers at the Kaluchak Army camp. Again India held off under assurances from the international community.

According to media reports in 2017, at the end of July 2002 India had also launched air-strikes against Pakistani bunkers at the LoC in the Kel area of Kupwara, the first such operation by the Air Force after the Kargil war.
At the end of December 2001, India had withdrawn its High Commissioner to Pakistan, Vijay Nambiar, and asked the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi to cut down the number of officials and staff at the mission by 50%, and banned Pakistan International Airlines from Indian airspace. Pakistan responded by cutting the Indian diplomatic presence in Islamabad by half, and banning Indian flights from Pakistani airspace. In May 2002, India asked Pakistan High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi to leave.
India also considered withdrawing the MFN (most favoured nation) status — which is the step it has taken now — and abrogating the Indus Waters Treaty, deciding against both as unsound, and in the long run bad for India’s interests as these could become precedent-setters and used against India internationally.

Non-engagement tactic
But along with coercive diplomacy, back-channel negotiations were on throughout the whole period to normalise relations. Full-scale diplomatic relations resumed a year later, in May 2003, when India appointed Menon as the High Commissioner to Pakistan and Aziz Ahmad Khan arrived in Delhi as Pakistan’s High Commissioner. The joint declaration of January 2004 that flowed from the landmark Vajpayee-Musharraf summit is seen by some as the result of India’s strong stand at the time of the Parliament attack.
Since then, India has used non-engagement as its main weapon.

In July 2006, after the Lashkar-e-Toiba struck Mumbai with seven coordinated train bombs killing 209 people, India said it would “pause” the then ongoing composite dialogue with Pakistan for the time being. Indian officials said off the record then that there was no point in taking extreme steps and then walking back to the table. Rather, it was better to keep all options open while making Pakistan “sweat”. For Islamabad, diplomatic victory is to bring India to the talks table, and New Delhi sensed that to keep Pakistan guessing on this front would be punishment enough. The composite dialogue resumed only after the October 2006 Musharraf-Manmohan Singh Havana summit on the sidelines of the NAM meet.
After the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008, India pushed the pause button once again on the composite dialogue, and after that, efforts by the two sides to restart talks have failed repeatedly on what the talks should be about. India’s position is that talks can be held only to discuss cross-border terror; Pakistan says talks should include Kashmir as well. Pakistan’s early insistence that the two countries should go back to the 2004-08 composite dialogue was rebuffed by India, which saw in it a design by Islamabad to show that a line had been drawn under Mumbai. India’s efforts to isolate Pakistan at the time bore some fruit — the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hafiz Saeed were designated under UNSC 1267. But beyond this, the world did not stop doing business with Pakistan, seen as crucial to the West’s war in Afghanistan.

In 2015-2016, India called off plans to hold talks about talks, agreed upon at the Modi-Sharif meeting in Lahore, after the January 2016 Pathankot attack. The decision to call off planned foreign minister-level talks after Imran Khan became Prime Minister also hewed to the set pattern. Though the “surgical strike” after the Uri attack, announced to the nation, was billed as a muscular response, it brought no improvement.
Now, as India considers its choices in the wake of the latest attack in Kashmir, there is déjà vu about the options, and the limitations of each. As former High Commissioner to Pakistan Sharat Sabharwal has pointed out, revoking the MFN status has symbolic value only. It will hardly hurt the Pakistan state as the country’s exports to India are 2% of its global exports.
Calling off the Kartarpur Corridor talks, scheduled in March, could be another option. But India has not even talked about this yet, underlining the difficulties on this front."

Abhijeet Bhattacharya is one of the few celebrities on Twitter who actively use the social media platform to openly express their opinions on various issues, but in a slightly different manner. From abusing political leaders to Bollywood stars, the singer has always kept each and every one of them on the tip of the knife with his derogatory remarks.
This has also landed him in trouble several times and he even got arrested for trolling a woman on Twitter. But it looks like the singer, who is infamous for ranting on the social platform, hasn’t learnt his lesson yet. He recently lashed out at filmmakers like Karan Johar, Mahesh Bhatt and actors Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan for allowing Pakistani artiste to work in their films after the recent Uri terrorist attack. Eighteen soldiers were killed in the attack.
In a series of tweets, Abhijeet called KJo, Bhatts and superstar Khans names for giving work to Pakistani artists like Fawad Khan, Mawra Hocane, Atif Aslam, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Ghulam Ali. He also went on to ask the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj why do they provide visas and welcome them to the country.
The singer claims that these “anti-national” filmmakers need to be taught a lesson. He goes on to call them “bigger enemies then #TerrorStatePak”. He said in his tweet, “I never said boycott .. I said kick these Paki b**** #ActAgainstPak ..shame @karanjohar @MaheshNBhatt for breeding feeding them #UriAttack.”"

At the International Film Festival of India being held in Goa, Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu urged filmmakers to make movies that preserve “our values and traditions”. Lamenting the new crop of movies as needlessly explicit, he referenced old Indian cinema that relied “on actors’ expressions” to portray sweet longing. “Filmmakers are becoming too lazy and the content is bearing the consequences,” said Naidu to a crowd of a few hundred people.
He went on to add that our films should promote gender justice, respect for elders and humanism (The Indian Express, November 21, 2016).
Mr. Naidu is entitled to his opinion — and so far, filmmakers are entitled to reject it. One of the lesser perks (I’m sure) of being the I & B Minister is that you get to stand on a podium and expostulate on what makes for good and bad cinema (without ever having made a movie or having any experience working as a critic). No doubt, Mr. Naidu feels nostalgic for films from his youth, when tales of calamity and grinding poverty were the norm. For the generation growing up in the ’60’s and ’70’s, a visit to the hall meant endless weeping, but there was so little to do in terms of entertainment that they went anyway. Take Dosti, the 1964 superhit about a friendship between two boys, one blind, the other a cripple. The greatest moment of levity is when they make money by teaming up to sing, but somebody steals it when they’re sleeping on the footpath. It’s the kind of movie that makes you want to shoot yourself but it resonated with a struggling, newly independent nation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Us, the heirs of liberalisation, have been exposed to more nuanced despair in Indian films. There’s an audience for depictions of urban angst, with the just released Dear Zindagi, and an equally large one for the gritty realism of Udta Punjab. However, it’s
getting worryingly tougher for all types of movies to flourish in an atmosphere of underlying cultural coercion. A film can get derailed anytime since India seems to be constantly in the zone of perilous political uncertainty. After the Uri attack, Karan Johar was forced to declare he wouldn’t work with Pakistani artistes, since the MNS threatened to ban his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Rock On 2 had the spectacular bad luck of releasing on November 11, three days after demonetisation when citizens were still reeling from the shock. Along with so many other businesses, this has had devastating consequences for the film industry.
In Goa, Mr. Naidu suggested filmmakers connect two R’s: reason and reality. Who knows, a future script may have a love story of a chance meeting in one of the endless queues outside a bank. Since the Indian viewer has been known to be an escapist dreamer, it’s best to gloss over those collapsing to death there."

Pakistan’s decision to attend the Heart of Asia conference in December in Amritsar is likely to lead to the first engagement of Islamabad with India after the surgical strikes in the wake of the Uri attack. Though the engagement would take place in a multilateral setting, it is expected to be significant in the backdrop of the strained ties between the two countries. While Pakistan’s foreign minister Sartaj Aziz confirmed early this week about Pakistan’s decision to attend the conference — which is focused on the future of Afghanistan — it has not yet spelt out the “level of representation”.
Watch What Else Is Making News 

Sources said that, as things stand, the Pakistan High Commission will be attending the conference on behalf of the Pakistan government. But a political call will be taken closer to the date on whether officials or ministers from Pakistan will attend, Pakistan diplomatic sources said.
From the Indian side, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is expected to host the conference in Amritsar. While the decision by Islamabad comes in the wake of the Indian diplomatic offensive to isolate Pakistan, New Delhi feels that Pakistan would have found it difficult to stay out of the Heart of Asia conference since it has political stakes in Afghanistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It doesn’t want to be left out,” Indian government sources said. Pakistan has always nurtured apprehension about India’s role in Afghanistan, and the fears have deepened in recent years with Delhi stepping up defence and security cooperation with Kabul.
And, with Afghanistan joining India in pulling out of the SAARC summit, as it is quite disappointed with Islamabad over the Taliban reconciliation process, Islamabad appears even more wary.
Early this week, Aziz, the adviser on foreign affairs to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said Pakistan will participate in the regional meet to be held in Amritsar during December 3-4. “Pakistan will continue to attend all international forums,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News channel.
India launched a move to isolate Pakistan over the terrorism issue after the attack on an Army camp at Uri in Kashmir in September that was blamed on the Jaish-e-Mohammed. Troops of the two countries have traded fire on the Line of Control and India carried out surgical strikes that it says resulted in “significant casualties”. Pakistan has denied the strikes and raised alleged rights violations by Indian security forces in J&K."

PTI Photo
What happened in Uri last week was an act of war, but as usual we diminished it by describing it as terrorism. Ever since it was defeated in Kargil nearly 20 years ago, Pakistan has made it absolutely clear time and time again that it will wage a new kind of war against India, and yet the men in charge of India’s security remain in denial. If we had acknowledged at least after 26/11 that India was in a state of war, then it is possible that the urgency that wartime brings may have become evident by now, and it would not have been so easy for four men to inflict the damage they did at a brigade headquarters so close to the border.
The Defence Minister acknowledged later that mistakes must have been made for the attack to have been so successful. We must hope that he will now punish those who were careless enough to allow 18 Indian soldiers to be killed so easily. The horrible truth is that Pakistan’s military strategists seem to know exactly what they are doing while in India our strategists continue to deal with national security in a dangerously lackadaisical fashion. So as we approach the eighth anniversary of 26/11, we need to truthfully admit that neither Mumbai, nor the coast on which our commercial capital sits is any safer today than it was in 2008. It is true that armoured cars can be seen in the streets of Mumbai when there is a ‘high alert’ and true that there are patrol boats visible now and then in the waters that separate this island city from the mainland of India. But, it is equally true that the men involved in these operations have no special training.

So if the men spotted in Uran last week were Pakistani jihadists, it is very possible they will find it just as easy to hold Mumbai to ransom for as long as Ajmal Kasab and gang did. It is also possible that like last time, it will take 24 hours for trained commandos to be transported to Mumbai, and that after landing in this city, there will be the logistical delays we saw last time. If we want things to change, we will have to begin by acknowledging that we are not dealing with random religious fanatics but with Pakistani soldiers trained in a new kind of warfare. Jihadist groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba are assets of the Pakistani army.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After 18 soldiers were killed in Uri, spokesmen of the government of India did an excellent job internationally defining Pakistan as a country that uses terrorism as State policy. This is good but unnecessary since Pakistan is already viewed as the headquarters of the worldwide jihad by almost every country except China. What we should be concentrating more on is strengthening India’s defences exactly as we would in a time of war.
Also Read P Chidambaram’s column: In search of a Pakistan policy
Instead of dithering between dialogue and hostilities, we should recognise that the military men who control Pakistan’s foreign policy have a vested interest in hostilities. Tea parties with Nawaz Sharif will make no difference. What may make a difference is if we deal directly with the military men. Dr Manmohan Singh did this with Pervez Musharraf and, from all accounts, came closest to bringing about a Kashmir solution. Musharraf himself admitted at a press conference I was present at in Davos that a solution was possible if everyone took one step back from their stated positions. Then he lost his job and the rest is history.
Speaking of Kashmir, we need also to accept that Pakistan’s hatred of India is unlikely to end even if our Kashmir problem does. It is no longer the ‘core issue’ but merely an excuse to pursue the ultimate dream, which is to break India into pieces. It is frightening how many ordinary Pakistanis believe that this is one day going to happen. It seems to comfort them in their own failed Islamic republic to think that one day Pakistan will become India’s equal. India’s economic achievements since we abandoned Nehruvian socialism frighten Pakistanis almost more than our military strength. It is no accident that of all Indian cities it was Mumbai that was targeted in 2008.
So we must accept that it is no longer just Kashmir that is the issue. And that we are at war. Pakistan does indeed produce an endless supply of recruits for the worldwide jihad but the men it sends to India to kill innocent people are a different breed. They may be soldiers of Islam like ordinary jihadists but they have also been trained to think of India as an ‘existential threat’. If we are to defend our beloved Dar ul Harb against Allah’s soldiers, we must begin by accepting that we are at war with Pakistan.

Dear Fawad Afzal Khan,
I will keep it short and simple. I have no problems with you coming to India, acting in Bollywood, earning more name, more fame and more money in our country. Be rest assured that I don’t support bans and those who do…well that’s their opinion. But I certainly have a problem with your silence…your radio silence. Why are you silent today when India is both hurt and angry after the dastardly terror attacks in Uri? Have you forgotten how much love and respect we have showered on you here. In case you have forgotten, let me remind you what you once told me at the trailer launch of Kapoor and Sons.
“Whenever I have come here, I have experienced tremendous love and hospitality in India and people here have given me a lovely and warm welcome. It feels like family here in India and wherever I have gone in this country, it has always been an amazing experience.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Don’t you think a tweet from you condemning this act of terror would have been a welcome move. You may say it’s your right to remain silent. I again don’t have a problem with that. But it certainly irks me to see that your silence is selectively applied. You were quick to denounce the Paris terror attacks in the following words.
“Shocked and saddened; praying for Paris, praying for humanity #Parisattacks.”
Aren’t you shocked and saddened now after Uri attacks, Mr Khan?
Your other Pakistani counterparts too have followed the same modus operandi. Ali Zafar condemned the Paris attacks by writing, “#PrayForParis #PrayForPeace. No words.” And Mahira Khan expressed her sorrow by saying, “Heartbreaking. What a world we live in, no words. #ParisAttacks.” Mahira had even denounced the Orlando shooting episode by tweeted a picture with a message that read, “Sad!!Disgusting! Prayers for the families that have lost their loved ones. #OrlandoNightclubShooting.”
Why are you and your colleagues who rake in much moolah here desisting from taking a stand now? Chup kyu ho gaye? What scares you? Is it because you are as you once told me a ‘political illiterate’ who doesn’t keep up with current affairs and doesn’t feel right to get involved in these matters? Or is it because you fear any message condemning or even praying for the victims of Uri would make you unpopular and perhaps unpatriotic back home in Pakistan? Either of the above reasons can’t be taken as excuses anymore.
I believe art and culture shouldn’t be restricted by boundaries and India, as a democracy, has always welcomed talent from all across the globe. Many outsiders earn their name, fame and money here and we have only celebrated their success. We have accorded the same privileges to you and your countrymen in Bollywood which makes it all the more obligatory for you to take a stand now and denounce terrorism like you did after the Paris attacks.
Many believe art and culture promote harmony and peace. If that is so, it is time for you to stand up and do that. Remember when you are working in a country outside of Pakistan as an actor, you are automatically representing your country of birth in the foreign land. Priyanka Chopra may be a Hollywood star today but she is first an Indian and an ambassador of Bollywood in the West. Similarly you are a cultural and film ambassador of Pakistan working in India and it’s your duty to see to it that through your words and deeds peace prevails every time terrorism is directed at India from your country. Now whether you make that clear through a tweet, a video message or a film is something for you to decide. But decide and act fast because silence is not golden anymore."

Goa’s Director General of Police Muktesh Chander has appealed people to boycott Karan Johar’s latest film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil for allegedly insulting the legendary playback singer Mohammad Rafi. Chander is upset over the dialogue in the movie which allegedly equates singing of Rafi to crying. In the film, Anushka Sharma is seen telling Ranbir Kapoor, “Mohammad Rafi? Woh gaate kam, rote zyada the na.” The singer’s family has taken objection to the dialogue in the movie, which was embroiled in a controversy before its release as it featured Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.
“Md Rafi was one of the greatest singers of India and needs no certificate from anyone. If you are a Rafi fan, boycott this movie,” Chander tweeted. The 1988 batch IPS officer, who is posted as Director General of Police, also quoted a report which quotes Shahid Rafi, the son of the late singer. Chander could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated calls and text messages while his office confirmed that he is in Delhi to attend an official meeting.

After the film’s release, Rafi’s family had raised objections against the dialogue saying that it wasn’t needing in the film as the dialogue has nothing to do with film’s plot. In an exclusive conversation with indianexpress.com, Rafi’s son, Shahid said, “This dialogue doesn’t take the movie forward or backwards and if that is the case, what was the need to include this dialogue? And while writing this dialogue, didn’t they realise who they were talking about? Mohammed Rafi is a versatile legendary singer and I am not saying this just because he is my father. Even after 36 years of his passing away, my father’s fan following is far more than many other singers of our industry. My father was an institution. He was a very down-to-earth person. He was like a saint. People still worship him. Nobody in the industry says anything bad about my father. This dialogue is an insult. It is stupid. The man who wrote this dialogue is stupid. My father sang for Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Biswajeet Singh. From love songs to qawwali, he has sung it all. It is ridiculous to say whatever has been said in the film.”

The film has been in news ever since the Uri attack. This Ranbir Kapoor starrer faced protests when MNS had raised a flag against the presence of Pakistani artists in Indian films. The stand-off between MNS chief Raj Thackeray and Johar was resolved after Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadanavis struck a truce between them. Even though the film is doing well at the box-office, intentionally or unintentionally, the film has been making new reasons to irk people around and create controversies.

Terming the deadly Uri militant attack as “unfortunate”, BSP president Mayawati today asked the Central government to chalk out a firm long-term plan to deal with “Pakistan-backed” terror. “The attack on the army installation in Uri killing 18 jawans is most unfortunate and a matter of concern,” Mayawati said in a press releasein Lucknow.
“Now it is time for the Central government to chalk out a long-term plan by striking a consensus to deal with such incidents backed by Pakistan,” she said, adding that the inconsistent Pakistan policy pursued by successive governments at the Centre has caused massive loss of life and property in the country.
“Such terror strikes have been going on at regualar intervals … now the time has come to chalk out a firm stragegy to put an effective check on them and this is what the people of the country want,” she said. Commenting on the turmoil in the Valley, she said it proves that the PDP-BJP governnment there has “failed”, not only in providing security to the citizens there, but also in working for peoples’ welfare.
The BSP chief said there has also been “no positive result” of the all party delegation which was sent to Jammu and Kashmir. There should be no pre-conditions on holding talks with Indian citizens under the ambit of constitution, she said, and hoped that state and union governments would initiate steps in this direction soon."

FROM possible strikes against jihadist military infrastructure across the Line of Control to Pakistan Army positions that are alleged to have helped push infiltrators, an entire range of responses are being considered by the Indian security establishment in retaliation against Sunday’s attack in Uri, government sources told The Indian Express.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, sources said, chaired a Sunday morning meeting involving top intelligence and Army officials, where he called for options to be prepared for presentation to the Prime Minister.
The Northern Command, senior military sources said, has begun assessing plans to strike Pak Army positions that are suspected to have facilitated the infiltration of jihadist groups through the LoC, using special forces or artillery. In addition, New Delhi is also considering deeper strikes on training camps across the LoC, as well as the use of intelligence assets to target commanders responsible for the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The discussion on Sunday, which included representatives of the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing and the Directorate-General of Military Operations, also touched on possible Pak military responses to Indian strikes.

“We will avenge the killings of our soldiers”, a top military commander told The Indian Express, “but we will do so based on cold-blooded professional military assessment, and on a timeline of our choosing, not one dictated by political imperatives or the prime-time news cycle”.
The intelligence services are scheduled to hold a series of meetings on Monday to review and assess available information on the Uri strike, sources said. The key evidence so far, a senior military official said, has come from the Defence Intelligence Agency, which provided intercepted communications which led Director-General of Military Operations Ranbir Singh to tell reporters on Sunday that the strike had been carried out by the Jaish-e-Muhammad — also responsible for the January 2 attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot.

However, based on data gathered by monitoring coded jihadist communications around Uri in the hours after the attack began, both the Intelligence Bureau and the Indian Army’s Srinagar-based XV corps are believed to have told the Government they assess the Lashkar-e-Taiba may have had a role in the strike.
Few details have emerged, either, on precisely where the terror assault team crossed the Line of Control, though military sources in Srinagar said they believe it likely crossed the Haji Pir pass, travelling north towards Uri, over the weekend.

The exercise initiated by the NSA on Sunday, sources said, is the most thorough-going since the 26/11 strikes, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had considered air and missile strikes against Lashkar-e-Taiba camps inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Singh, however, dropped the plans inside days of the attacks, after the armed forces and intelligence services said they could not guarantee success.

Fali Homi Major, the then-air force chief, had told the Prime Minister he was prepared to strike inside Pakistan, but could not do so because the intelligence services could not provide adequate digital data on Lashkar camps. Then army chief Deepak Kapoor also demurred, saying the army was not prepared for a brief, surgical war.

Indian diplomats have been asked to brief world capitals on the terror strike ahead of the United Nations General Assembly meeting commencing on Monday, where Pakistan is expected to aggressively raise the Kashmir issue. The United States on Sunday “strongly condemned” the Uri attack but has not not named Pakistan. In private, United States diplomats have expressed concerns about the escalation of military tensions.
The Prime Minister, a senior diplomatic sources said, is however unlikely to pursue direct diplomatic options to resolve the crisis, as he did after the Pathankot crisis. “Though the Prime Minister has not yet foreclosed non-military options”, a senior Indian diplomat said, “he simply does not believe Nawaz Sharif is in a position to deliver on terrorism”.

Following the Pathankot Air Force base attack, Pakistan had briefly clamped down on Jaish-e-Muhammad’s activities, enforcing a 2002 ban on the organisation. However, its key leaders have been increasingly visible in recent months. In the current issue of the group’s magazine, al-Qalam, military chief Abdul Rauf Asghar wrote dismissively Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s promise to crack down on terrorism. “There have been thousands of action plans to wide out jihad”, he wrote, “but jihad and jihadists thrive, and will thrive until the day of judgment”.
Both Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders have been delivering speeches calling for jihad against Indian forces in Kashmir, and raising funds for operations in the state."

As the Gujarat Assembly convened for the Budget session here on Monday, the ruling BJP and opposition Congress blamed each other for the terror attacks in the country and condemned the killing of 40 CRPF men in Kashmir’s Pulwama.
While the BJP claimed the “unresolved” Kashmir issue being the root cause of the situation in the state today, the opposition raked up the release of Pakistan-based terrorist Masood Azhar by then BJP government in 1999 in exchange for the passengers of a hijacked Indian Airlines’ flight. Masood’s terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad has claimed the responsibility for the February 14 suicide attack on the CRPF convoy.
Speaking on behalf of the government during a resolution moved to condemn the Pulwama terror attack, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said, “This is all because of unresolved Kashmir issue… If consolidation of Kashmir had been left to (then Union Home Minister) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by Congress leaders… I believe… then today this issue would not have been there. No terrorist attacks, suicides, matrydom of soldiers would have taken place there… But, unfortunately we viewed Kashmir differently and could not get it united with the country. The thorn of which is still hurting in crores of Indian’s hearts.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Responding to the accusations of the treasury bench, Congress leader Amit Chavda raked up the 1999 Kandahar hijack incident when the BJP was in power at the Centre. “The mastermind behind the Pulwama attack, Masood Azhar, was released in the past. The (BJP) government made him sit in the aircraft and escorted him till Kandhahar (in Afghanistan). If that time strict action had been taken, then these incidents would not have happened,” Chavda said.
Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaign speech in the run-up to the 2014 election campaign, Chavda said, “Today, people who were assured that in place of one head, 10 heads would be brought (from Pakistan) are seeking answers to these questions. People are now demanding decisive action, not just assurances.”
Speaker Rajendra Trivedi objected to Chavda’s remarks and asked him to stick to paying condolences to the dead CRPF men.
Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani said that while people extended unconditional support to the Centre to fight terrorism, several attacks have taken place on the armed forces in Kashmir in the last couple of years. “There are many other means to acquire power. But when someone tries to break our unity, we all must resolve to give a befitting reply to such elements. Mere talks will not serve any purpose. We have to take decisive steps to eliminate terrorism,” the Congress leader said.
To this, Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said terror attacks have been taking place for over 20 years, while Modi became Prime Minister only five years ago. “The people of this country have full faith in our Prime Minister. Earlier, no country backed us after such attacks. But now, thanks to Modi’s efforts in these five years, around 40 countries have expressed solidarity with us,” the minister said. “Within days of Uri attack, a surgical strike was carried out (across the Line of Control),” he added.
Expressing grief over the death of 40 CRPF men, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said, “The martyrdom would not go waste. Every drop of blood shed by the jawans would be avenged. Severe anger against Pakistan and terrorists has burst open among every citizen of the country. They are reposing full faith on our armed forces, on our government. Every person wish fight should be taken to the level of face-off. The Union government has started taking definite steps to ensure that there is no terrorist activity on our land; have to observe some patience.”Ahmedabad NewsTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownVadodara: 92% ICU beds occupied as cases spikeGujarat confidential: In action modeClick here for more

Condemning the Narendra Modi-led government’s move to launch a diplomatic war against Islamabad after the dastardly Uri attack, the Shiv Sena on Monday said that the Centre is simply having war of words with Pakistan rather than taking some serious actions against the neighbouring nation.
“Solders are losing their lives and we are still busy in giving warning to Pakistan and appreciating our efforts. But the truth is if Pakistan really wants to have war with us then we are also ready,” the Sena said in its editorial, Saamna.

The Shiv Sena further asserted that the Centre is talking about isolating Pakistan, but eventually all the supporters of India can be witnessed maintaining their friendship with Islamabad whether it be Russia with its Joint drill, Indonesia which provided Defence equipment or Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) who has extended its support to Pakistan openly and is willing to send Fact finding committee to Kashmir.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“No matter how much hue and cry we make to isolate Pakistan after the Uri attack on the international forum, the truth remains that all these efforts are useless. In fact a new fear has cropped up that India might face isolation on the global platform,” the editorial said.
The BJP ally emphasised that Pakistan’s statement asserting that the Uri attack took place because of the Kashmir unrest, somehow indicates that they accepted their involvement in the attack.
On India’s decision to provide evidence in the United Nations against Pakistan, the Shiv Sena said that since the UN is asserting to resolve the issue bilaterally, then there is no use of providing evidence on this issue.
Earlier on Saturday, the Prime Minister launched a scathing attack on Pakistan and said that India would never forget the Uri terror attack and would make all efforts to isolate Islamabad globally.
“A day will come when the people of Pakistan will go against their own government to fight terrorism. India has been successful in isolating you (Pakistan) globally, and we will intensify our efforts to make sure that you are isolated globally. The people of Pakistan should ask their leaders that India and Pakistan got freedom in the same year, but India exports software and your (Pakistan) leaders are exporting terrorists,” said Prime Minister Modi, while addressing a public rally in Kozhikode.
Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will address the UN General Assembly in New York today, where she is expected to give a stinging response to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s UNGA speech.
Outlining India’s focus for the UN General Assembly session, New Delhi’s envoy to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said terrorism is the primary concern for India as well as for nations across the world.
He listed reform of the UN Security Council, sustainable development, climate change and peacekeeping as other priorities for India in the current UNGA session.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup also said that one can also expect a continued focus from India on the theme of terrorism which is today undoubtedly the single biggest challenge to international peace and security."

In a stern message to Pakistan, the Indian Army on Friday said it reserves the right to “retaliate appropriately” to any incident leading to the loss of lives of its troops due to Pakistani firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, reported PTI. As per the report, Indian Army’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen A K Bhatt conveyed over the phone to his Pakistani counterpart DGMO Maj Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza that the trend of cross-border infiltration has been continuing, impacting peace and tranquillity in the border areas, the Army said.
“Lt Gen Bhatt reiterated that the Indian Army is a professional Army and reserves the right to retaliate appropriately to any incident leading to loss of lives of Indian troops,” it said. According to the Army, Lt General A K Bhatt conveyed to the Pakistan DGMO that cross-border infiltration was also impacting internal security situation in Jammu and Kashmir and that this was evident from continued attempts of sniping and targeting of Indian troops undertaken through cross-border actions “duly supported” by the Pakistan Army troops.

While reaffirming the India’s Army’s commitment to maintaining peace and tranquility along the LoC, the DGMO reiterated that this can only be achieved if there was a reciprocal effort from Pakistan. The telephonic conversation was initiated by Maj Gen Mirza who claimed the Indian Army was targeting Pakistani civilians in the Jammu sector.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An Army statement read: “The Indian DGMO in his response highlighted that all ceasefire violations in the Jammu sector were initiated by Pakistani Rangers and the BSF troops deployed only responded appropriately to them. “It was also emphasised that no targeted firing on civilians was carried out by the Indian troops. Apart from this, firing by BSF troops was initiated against armed intruders attempting to infiltrate from close proximity of Pakistani posts along Amritsar border.”
There has been a spate of ceasefire violations along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir perpetrated by Pakistani troops and the Indian Army has been retaliating effectively to Pakistani actions.
Ever since the Army carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC), there has been an increase in the casualties suffered by the security forces, the number of militants killed and a sharp rise in the ceasefire violations. According to government data, 110 militants were killed by the Army between January and September last year (the surgical strikes took place on the morning of September 29, 2016).
On September, 2016, the Army’s Special Forces carried out “surgical strikes” on terror launch pads inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to the Uri attack by militants that left 17 soldiers dead."

Pakistan wants peaceful relations with all its neighbours, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said and accused India of resorting to “double standards” on the Kashmir issue.
Sharif’s remarks came as General Peter Pavel, Chairman Military Committee NATO, called on the Prime Minister here.
According to an official statement, Sharif said on the occasion that India was creating problems and has resorted to double standards on the issue of Kashmir.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

He said that “India unfairly blamed Pakistan for Uri attack without investigating the incident,” according to the statement.
He said Pakistan would continue to extend moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmir cause.
Sharif said that “the atrocities by the Indian forces have resulted into the loss of precious human lives and blinded hundreds through the use of brutal force”.
Sharif also reiterated desire for peaceful ties with India.
“We want peaceful relations with all of our neighbours,” he said.
According to the statement, Pavel said, “I have listened to your yesterday’s speech in the Parliament where you eloquently raised the issue of Kashmir. The Kashmir issue has to be addressed as two nuclear powers are party to it and the world cannot remain indifferent and must be concerned.”
The Prime Minister said that the Pakistani armed forces have rendered matchless sacrifices in the war against terrorism."

Early on Sunday morning, in one of the most devastating attacks on the Army in Jammu and Kashmir, 17 Army personnel were killed and 20 left injured by four heavily armed terrorists who sneaked into the administrative buildings and store complex of an infantry battalion in Uri. This was the home the 12 Infantry Brigade, near the Line of Control (LoC).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The four terrorists were gunned down by Army personnel after a three-hour gunbattle, and a combing operation was underway. The Army said its initial findings suggested that the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad and had come from across the LoC.
Army sources in J&K said, as per their assessment, the terrorists probably infiltrated in the last two days and familiarised themselves with the area through discreet reconnaissance.
A PTI report from Islamabad quoted Pakistan Army spokesman Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa as saying that the DGMOs discussed the situation along the LoC over hotline. “Refuting the unfounded and premature Indian allegation, Pakistan DGMO asked his counterpart to share any actionable intelligence,” Radio Pakistan reported citing an ISPR release.

A senior Army officer posted in the area said the reason for the high casualties was the large number of soldiers present due to the turn-over of battalions and the tents catching fire, as the terrorists fired indiscriminately."

Express Photo by Praveen Jain. 31.07.2014.
Minister of State of the Ministry of External Affairs V K Singh on Wednesday said the aim of surgical strikes was to send a stern message to Pakistan that India will not accept continued terrorism as new normal. Speaking at Ministry of External Affairs’ mid-term press conference, Singh said, “The aim of surgical strike was to convey to Pakistan that we will not accept continuance of terrorism as the new norm. Our own good faith has been amply demonstrated time and again through repeated initiatives to normalise the relationship. However, as we have often stated, talks and terror cannot go together.” The press conference largely focused on MEA’s work in the last two and a half years.
Speaking on terrorism, Singh added that barring Pakistan, all the countries of the region have demonstrated their willingness to stand together against the menace of terrorism that could undermine their collective hopes. “India too, has shown that we will not back down in the face of assaults against the security of our people, the prosperity of the region and the interests of the international community,” he said. The Indian Army had conducted overnight surgical strikes across the Line of Control on September 29 reportedly in response to the dastardly Uri attack by terrorists from across the border which left at least 18 soldiers dead in its wake.
ALSO READ: Surgical strikes: What is it? Why is it important?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Highlighting the government’s priority in the protection and safety of Indians abroad, Singh said the welfare of our citizens, whether they are in Baghdad or Brisbane, has been the guiding priority of our Government over the last 31 months, and we have consciously placed it front and centre of our foreign policy. “We have let our actions speak louder than our words ever could – in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan and in the wider Gulf region, and Europe and the Americas. We have done so, not only based on the principle that Indians abroad must benefit from the protection of the Indian state but also on the broader notion that each human life is sacred. It is this that motivated the rescue of 1947 Foreign Nationals from 48 countries stranded in Yemen, and many foreign nationals from Nepal following the earthquake in Nepal,” he said.
The surgical strikes targeted seven terror launch pads across using heliborne and ground forces. Several political leaders, cutting across party lines, have since hailed the Army for successfully executing surgical strikes and backed the Modi government’s decision as a befitting retaliation to Pakistan.
A surgical strike is essentially a swift and targeted attack on specific target that aims to neutralise them while ensuring minimum collateral damage to the surrounding areas and civilians. Neutralisation of targets with surgical strikes also prevents escalation to a full blown war."

With Masood Azhar-led JeM suspected to be behind the Uri attack, Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Monday sought to put the National Democratic Alliance government in the dock, suggesting the earlier NDA regime had “compromised” with national security by releasing the terrorist following the 1999 Indian airlines hijack.
In a series of tweets, he also made a strong pitch for building strong international pressure to isolate Pakistan in the wake of the terror strike and also stressed on looking into the “failure” of the Army to protect its camp near the LoC.
“We compromised to let Masood Azhar go after Indian Airlines hijack. Lesson? Never compromise with National Security,” the Congress General Secretary said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammad behind the attack. Of course with full connivance of Pakistan Establishment,” further said.
“Should also look at the failure of the Army to protect its Army Camp near the LOC,” he said.
“Pay homage to the Martyrs in Uri. GOI must strongly build International pressure to isolate Pakistan”, the Congress leader added.

With alertness very high post the surgical strikes on militant camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Uri attack, Indian Air Force is aggressively upgrading infrastructure in the eastern sector specially in Arunachal Pradesh.
IAF Eastern Air Command chief Hari Kumar said on Saturday that of the seven advanced landing grounds (ALGs) in Arunchal Pradesh, five have been made operational and two others will be ready by the end of the year.
Watch what else is making news

Apart from the ALGs, the IAF is also building capabilities to enhance performance in that state, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Infrastructure development (in the eastern air command) has not kept pace with the rest of the world to allow us to have better equipment and better services that can be provided in this sector … When we look at the performance of any sector, we are looking at building up of capability. The capability to meet challenge and we are not looking up at any specific country as our competitor or our enemy,” he said.
“In addition to the MiG 27 and the Hawks squadrons, we (EAC) are going to get another as the Rafale deal has been signed,” Kumar said.
Expressing concern over Pakistan sponsoring cross-border terrorism, Kumar said, “If you’ll look at the western sector, Pakistan has made it a state policy to use unconventional warfare because they could not match the strength militarily. They use unconventional warfare wherein they are trying to hit us with a thousand wounds.”
He expressed optimism that what happened in the western sector need not take place in the eastern part.
“What happened in the west need not transfer to activity in the east. It is confined to that area and now we are waiting to what would be Pakistan’s reaction,” Kumar said.
He said, “Both countries don’t want a war. War is not good for anybody, but we cannot let any country dictate terms to us and kill our soldiers.”"

Like we all know, Mahira Khan is not a stranger to controversies. The Pakistani actress, who starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Raees, earlier this year was unfortunately caught in the middle of a political turmoil between India and Pakistan owing to the Uri attacks and a ban on Pakistani artistes working in the country. Khan was barred from promoting her Bollywood debut in India with her team but she did attend promotional events in Dubai and while she was at it, she put her best foot forward.
	
	
		
			
The actress was seen in a chic off-shoulder Lavish Alice jumpsuit in white with a twisted front, which also gave the impression of a knot. Khan styled her outfit with voluminous curls and a pair of metallic ankle straps. Celebrity make-up artist Krystal George rounded her look perfectly with soft, subtle make-up. We love how she kept it simple and classy and how it was the perfect pick for a daytime look.
	
	
		
			
Now, a couple of months after her appearance, we spotted the same jumpsuit on Alia Bhatt while she was attending the Youtube Fan Fest. The ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’ actress too teamed it up with a pair of metallic footwear. As far as the styling is concerned, Bhatt opted for a bun, a fresh face and a bright pink lip shade. We think she wore the look more casually.
This time, there’s a clear winner and it’s none other than Mahira Khan! What do you think? Let us know in the comments below."

“Our civil n (sic) decent response in the past hasn’t been met with reciprocity so it’s time to act tough,” Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw tweeted. Recalling an earlier tweet in which he had said “I trust our army. They know how to pursue & retaliate” in the wake of the Uri attack, industrialist Anand Mahindra said: “I don’t need to add anything more today…”
PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Mahesh Gupta said there will be no impact on India’s trade and economy, adding that the volatility in the financial markets will also be short lived. India’s exports to the neighbouring country worked out to USD 2.17 billion, or 0.83 per cent, of the total Indian outward shipments while imports were less than USD 500 million, or 0.13 per cent, of the total inward shipments.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Indian economy has a strong bandwidth to deal with any possible after effects of the current state of tensions with Pakistan,” Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said. The chamber said that while reaction in the stock market to the news of India’s surgical strikes was understandable, there is no cause of concern for the country’s economy which has the capabilities to withstand any extra costs to be borne for the sake of our national security. Industry bodies FICCI and CII declined to comment. Exporters’ body FIEO Director General & CEO Ajay Sahai too ruled out any negative impact on India’s trade with other countries.
However, asked about the implications on India-Pakistan bilateral trade, Sahai said India’s move to review the most favoured nation (MFN) status accorded to its neighbour has raised some uncertainty for exporters on whether trade will normalise in the future. Reacting to the reports of surgical strikes, the Sensex plummeted 465.28 points to end at 27,827.53; whereas the Nifty nosedived 153.90 points to 8,591.25.
India carried out ‘surgical strikes’ on terror launch pads across the Line of Control(LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir last night, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them."

India and Pakistan have ‘serious problems’ which have to be discussed, said Pakistan High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit on Thursday. Speaking on the increasing diplomatic hostilities between the two neighbouring countries, Basit said, “There are serious problems between our two countries, we can’t shy away from those.” He also reiterated Pakistan’s desire for constructive talks and suggested that India must be ready for it as well. “Pakistan doesn’t wish to live in perpetual hostility. We are positive and constructive, but it takes two to tango,” said Basit.

Basit added that a decision must be taken regarding current relations between India and Pakistan saying,” Time has come to make up our mind whether we want status quo or we want to make a new beginning in our ties.”
Hostilities between India and Pakistan have grown ever since 19 Indian Army soldiers were killed in the Uri attacks in September. Relations soured further following Indian Army’s surgical strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control (LoC). Diplomatic relations were further hampered in October when defence-related documents were leaked to a Pakistan High Commission staffer which exposed an espionage ring involving Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)."

Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Thursday said the chances of war with Pakistan are very less keeping in mind the economic and development concerns of India.
“Nobody wants war. War causes problems with economy and development. We feel that deterrence should be there but war should not take place. We should keep striving for economic development. But if war like situation arises, then that is what armed forces are there for. The armed forces are always ready, but in my view, the chances of war are very less,” he said.

Raha was addressing a press meet after President Pranab Mukherjee presented Standards to two IAF units at the air force station here Thursday. He also termed the Pathankot attack a “setback” for the IAF. “This was the first time that the Air Force was specifically targeted by terrorists. They come from across the border and are called non-state actors, but we know what kind of support they get,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Responding to a question regarding the outcome of the visit of Pakistan’s probe team to the air base, he said that after the Uri attack, the matter has “slipped a little bit”. “I am sure attempts will be made to resolve this issue because two neighbours cannot be like this for long,” he said.
Earlier, speaking at the ceremony where he presented the Standards, President Pranab Mukherjee said that while India remains committed to peace, it will use all its might to protect its sovereignty.
“India’s increasing eminence in the comity of nations also draws its strength from the ever-increasing capabilities of our armed forces. Though we remain firmly committed to peace, we will use all our might to protect the sovereignty of our nation. I am confident that our valiant men and women in uniform will rise to the occasion to meet the challenges triumphantly,” he told the IAF personnel present at the event.
The President presented the Standards to two units of the IAF — the Barnala-based 501 Signals Unit and the 30 Squadron, based out of Pune.
The 501 Signals Unit operates radars and is one of the important network-centric units of the IAF which has the capability of looking deep into enemy territory through the aerostat radar system. The 30 Squadron operates the Sukhoi-30MKI fighter aircraft."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke at the two day National Executive Meet of the BJP in a non-televised address. In his address, he spoke about the demonetisation of higher value currency and its impact on people. He also said serving the poor was the best service to God. Stressing on bringing transparency in political funding, the prime minister said BJP fully supports the idea of transparency in political funding. Members at the meet gave a standing ovation to PM Modi for the “unprecedented” cross-border surgical strikes and the demonetisation “success”.

Party President Amit Shah also praised the prime minister on Friday for India’s stance after the Uri attack. He also listed the benefits of the demonetisation move and said that it would help the country get rid of corruption. The national executive meet also recounted BJP’s successes in 2016, including the party’s win in Assam and formation of government in Arunachal.

Here are the top quotes of the Prime Minister from his address:
* Use organisational strength to win over poor. Serving people amounts to serving God.
* BJP fully supports the idea of transparency in political funding
* Born in poverty, lived in it. Don’t be scared of criticism/accusations
* Important to make political process transparent
* For us, poor & poverty not just abt winning polls it’s an opportunity to serve
* Committed to change quality of life of poor. Demonetisation part of long term measures against graft, black money
Here is all that has happened in the BJP executive meet today
* The national executive praised the armed forces and came down heavily on Pakistan. “Terrorism is today seen by the democratic and civilised world as a scourge whereas Pakistan continues to use it as state policy. It continues to push terrorists into India and other countries and engages in terror attacks and promotes violent insurgent and separatist movement in J&K.”
* Union Minister for Education Prakash Javadekar on Friday had said Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that while it caused some trouble to people, demonetisation largely had the support of the people.
* All states except Bengal showed spike in income and revenue for month of November, December. Figures awaited: Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
* Bharatiya Janata Party today termed the aftermath of demonetisation a “sacred movement” during which the masses accepted the temporary suffering with enthusiasm and asserted that black money has now been deposited in banks that will lead to high revenues and bigger and cleaner GDP."

Sending a strong message to Pakistan, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Thursday “condemned efforts, including by States, to use religion to justify, sustain and sponsor terrorism against other countries”. This is an oblique reference to Pakistan’s involvement in Kashmir, and holds significance since the UAE has, as part of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), supported Islamabad-backed resolutions on Kashmir.
The joint statement, issued a day after the visiting Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also deplored efforts by countries to give religious and sectarian colour to political issues and pointed out the responsibility of all States to control the activities of the so-called ‘non-state actors’. This formulation was first used during the Crown Prince’s State visit in February 2016.

Underlining that terrorism posed a common threat to peace and security, the two leaders reiterated their strong condemnation of and “resolute opposition to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by whomever, and declared that there could be no justification for terrorism anywhere”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The UAE, which has been one of Pakistan’s closest allies, had also been one of the few countries to have recognised Taliban rule in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.
“The two sides condemned efforts, including by States, to use religion to justify, sustain and sponsor terrorism against other countries. They further deplored efforts by countries to give religious and sectarian colour to political issues and pointed out the responsibility of all States to control the activities of the so-called ‘non-state actors’,” the joint statement said.
It also said that the two leaders articulated their clear and unequivocal resolve to cooperate on counter-terrorism by adopting a policy of “zero tolerance” towards the menace of terrorism. Satisfied at the growing bilateral collaboration on counter-terrorism, information sharing and capacity-building, they expressed confidence that these efforts would contribute to regional and global peace and security.
The UAE and India agreed to coordinate efforts to “counter radicalisation and misuse of religion by groups and countries for inciting hatred and perpetrating acts of terrorism”.
“They emphasised the need to facilitate regular exchanges of religious scholars and intellectuals and to organise conferences and seminars to promote the values of peace, tolerance, inclusiveness and welfare that are inherent in all religions,” the statement said.
They also emphasised the importance of promoting a culture of inclusiveness, openness and tolerance within and among societies and agreed to work together closely to confront the global ills of extremism, terrorism and religious intolerance.
“They reiterated that the Indian and the UAE experiences in building inclusive societies should continue to be promoted as effective models in countering extremism and radicalism,” the statement said.
Lending support to New Delhi’s position on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations, they also called for early conclusion of negotiations. “Both sides noted the importance of efforts to disrupt terrorist networks, their financing and movement, in accordance with the relevant principles and purposes of the UN Charter and international laws. The two sides deplored the use of double standards in addressing the menace of international terrorism and agreed to strengthen cooperation in combating terrorism both at the bilateral level and within the multilateral system,” the statement said.
The two sides also mentioned the Uri attacks, although there was no public support for the “surgical strikes”. They also condemned the terrorist attacks in Kabul and Kandahar on January 10 in which five UAE diplomats were killed, and underscored the need to bring the perpetrators of these dastardly and cowardly acts to justice — again a reference to Pakistan’s ISI.
The statement said that Prime Minister Modi appreciated the support extended by UAE security agencies on specific issues of security concern to India — a reference to the ISIS threat. The two leaders reiterated that the ongoing close cooperation on a range of security issues, particularly on counter-terrorism, maritime security and cyber-security remained a key pillar of the bilateral strategic partnership.
Acknowledging the importance of the ongoing bilateral security cooperation for ensuring a conducive and peaceful environment for the progress and development of the two countries, the two sides agreed to further enhance cooperation in the fields of law enforcement, anti-money laundering, smuggling of fake currency, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal migration and other transnational organized crimes.
In a bid to take forward the defence cooperation pact, the leaders agreed to provide further impetus to these relations, including through joint exercises, training of naval, air and land forces, as also in the area of coastal defence and through participation in defence exhibitions etc.
“The UAE side acknowledged the opportunities offered under the ‘Make in India’ initiative for joint production of defence equipment in India and also for the procurement of defence material. In this regard, the two sides described the signing of an MoU on Cooperation in the field of Defence Industry during this visit as an important step forward,” it said.
The two sides expressed common resolve to bolster cooperation and exchanges on countering piracy in their shared maritime domain in the Gulf and the Indian Ocean regions and to exchange experiences in maritime security, including joint anti-piracy training and exercises.
On investments, they reviewed the progress in realising the $75-billion target for UAE investments in India’s plans for rapid expansion of next generation infrastructure development. Modi invited UAE participation in India’s National Infrastructure Investment Master Fund as an “anchor investor”."

Abhinav Saha
SUSHANT SINGH: There have been many developments in Jammu and Kashmir over the past two-and-a-half years, both political and in terms of internal security. Where and why, in your opinion, did things go wrong during this period?
In 2014-15, internal recruitment began increasing. More and more locals were joining (militancy). The numbers were not very large, 50-70, but as compared to 2011-12, where the figure was in single digits and most of the recruits were from across the Line of Control, it was high. These local recruits had family and friends in the region and when they got killed, there was more anger. Through 2015, for example, when there would be a search operation, locals would turn up in large numbers. During the attack on the Entrepreneur Development Institute (at Sempore-Pampore in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in 2016), even women came out to stop military operations. So the frustration had been building for some time and it all finally boiled over in 2016.
The way in which the new political dispensation came into the state also contributed to the dissatisfaction. And Pakistan had a very large role to play. We often see the insurgency in Kashmir as an internal one, but it has a huge transnational character — arms, terrorists, funds, support, all of it comes from Pakistan.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
They (Pakistan) were seeing a steady improvement in the situation; 2012, in fact, was the best year as far as controlling insurgency and violence was concerned. In 2016, Pakistan made an even bigger attempt to increase infiltration. All of these issues led to what happened in July 2016.
SUSHANT SINGH: Last year, when things were getting out of hand in J&K, you said politicians should step up and do more. Can you elaborate?
Militarily, I think, the situation has largely come under control. We hear of attacks such as the one in Pathankot and tend to think that the situation is getting bad. That is not true. Let me give you some data. I think 2001 was the worst year, and I am not talking purely from a security perspective, when the total casualties — civilians, military and terrorists — exceeded 4,500. In 2012, it was around 120-130, which is about 2.5 per cent of the peak levels. For 2016, which is now being considered to be the worst year in the Valley, data shows that (the total number of casualties) is about 5-6 per cent of peak levels. So, yes, we need to ensure that incidents such as Uri and Nagrota don’t happen, but from a security perspective, the situation has been contained to some extent. This, however, does not mean that things are completely under control and nothing more needs to be done. You now need a political approach to deal with the situation.
SUSHANT SINGH: How bad was the September 2016 attack on the Army base in Uri?
It was bad. I was sitting there and getting feedback and the number of casualties kept on increasing — 10,12, 18 — it was quite horrible to hear. One way of dealing with such a situation is to get completely defensive and make sure that the men of your garrison are okay. The other option is payback and that is what happened 20 days later.

SUSHANT SINGH: So the surgical strikes happened 20 days later. Can you tell us about that?
I cannot go into the details of what exactly happened. The government was clear that they wanted to put out a strong statement. That was the intent. There shouldn’t be a feeling that just because you are sitting on your (Pakistan’s) side of the LoC, you can’t be touched. That was the message that the government wanted to send out and it was a good one. I think in some ways it will dominate how we look at security in the future.
P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: So have surgical strikes never been conducted in the past?
I think it (the surgical strikes) was different in two ways. Firstly, in scale and scope, it was much larger than what had been done in the past, and I think the second thing was that the government stepped out and said, ‘yes, we did it’. That is how it was different from what happened in the past.
MUZAMIL JALEEL: You mentioned an increase in local recruitment. How does the military conduct operations in an area where a major chunk of the population does not want to be with the country?
As far as the issue of the majority of the population not wanting to be with India is concerned, I am not sure that is true, unless you are only referring to the Kashmir Valley and some elements there. It definitely doesn’t hold true for Jammu, Ladakh, Poonch, Rajouri districts etc. Yes, there is anger and a certain amount of angst among the youth. See, the answers are not difficult and it is not rocket science to understand what needs to be done. There is need for engagement, particularly with the youth. I think 70 per cent of the population there is below 30 years of age. They don’t have opportunities. They are also reluctant to come out of the state. There is enough scope for generating employment. There is scope for talking to these guys, understanding what they need. We need to talk to the traders, taxi owners, people in the tourism industry, students, we need to talk to everyone.
I think there is a little lack of confidence in terms of what can be done. If you ask me, there are many opportunities within J&K. There is a huge tourism industry, there is horticulture, local handicrafts, but how do we utilise it? Ultimately, everyone wants a peaceful life. I don’t think anyone wants this turmoil.
MUZAMIL JALEEL: Now there is a complete freeze as far as engagement is concerned. Do you think there is a need for some kind of a political discussion?
There is a feeling that there is a complete freeze in engagement, but it has to be done. Political issues have to be addressed. As far as the question of the presence of the military forces on the ground is concerned, well, it is like the chicken and egg story. See, when things are peaceful, the guys (security forces) will move out. Though there is a feeling that the Army is not pulling out forces… Look at the Jammu region. Over a period of time, the region cooled down and forces were pulled out. Today the security cover is very thin. But what do you do when you have a situation like last year (in the Valley)? The state can’t abdicate its responsibility to establish law and order. So, we were forced to push in some additional troops to keep the situation under control. There are no immediate answers. There are no easy solutions. We need to sit down, put our heads together and find a solution.
SUSHANT SINGH: What is your view on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act? Should it be done away with and if not, why?
Again we are looking at the situation from the wrong angle. Do we want the military to be in J&K or not, that is the basic issue. And if we think the military needs to be there, then there is no option but to have AFSPA. Otherwise, legally, the Army is not supposed to intervene in internal situations. Has the situation improved, and can we say that the military can be pulled out and things can be left entirely to the police and para-military forces? I don’t think we have reached that situation, although the Army has always held the view that internal security situations are best handled by the police.
SUSHANT SINGH: Should the Army find an alternative to AFSPA which is more palatable to the people?
There has been a fair amount of internal debate on whether some of the provisions can be done away with or can be diluted. We have not come to a consensus on that yet.
MUZAMIL JALEEL: The grievance in Kashmir is not just about AFSPA, it is also about the Army’s misuse of it. People cannot take the Army to civilian courts. Now, if the Army doesn’t trust civilian courts, then why will the people?
The fact that the military has its own justice system is not unique to India. Secondly, let me just clarify the legal provisions of AFSPA: It says if you want to prosecute somebody, you need sanction from the Central government. And again, the system of seeking sanctions from the Central government is not unique to the Army; it is there for government officials across the board.
There was a time, 10-15 years ago, when things were really looking bad but over the past five years, the Army has cleaned up its human rights record. People have been punished, they have been given life imprisonment. Now, we can’t explain why the civil court has acquitted somebody, that is the Indian justice system. We punish somebody, that person goes to court, the court acquits him, what is there for us to say?
MUZAMIL JALEEL: There is a feeling that the Army by not trusting any agency and by exonerating its people in court martials, has a free hand.
The issue is that the state has not been able to counter this kind of narrative. You keep hearing of things such as the Army is responsible for rapes and human rights violations, particularly in the international media. If you ask anyone when was the last time somebody was convicted for such a crime, there are no answers.
There is also a feeling in the military that sometimes we are being unfairly targeted. So many allegations of human rights violations have been proven false. An officer was charged with rape and he fought the case for 15 years in a civil court. Finally, he was acquitted. Consider the trauma that he went through. There is also a feeling that we should not subject our people to such an environment. Your promotions are stopped for 10-15 years, you keep fighting a case and then finally the charges are proven false. It is better then to take over the case and deal with it faster in our own military courts.
SHEELA BHATT: The PDP and BJP are parties with very different ideologies. Has the alliance made it difficult for security forces to handle the situation on the ground?
There hasn’t been any significant impact as far as military operations are concerned. We have remained independent and there has been no pressure from the political side to conduct operations in a certain way. I don’t think there was another option but for these two parties to join hands. That was the mandate.
P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: As far as the surgical strikes are concerned, was it a political call or more of a military consideration? Were the goals of the surgical strikes, in your assessment, met? There was also no independent assessment of, say, the extent of the damage?
The decision to make the strikes public was a political one. They decided that we want to make an announcement. They (the government) were fairly closely involved in the planning process, and decided that this is how we want to deal with the situation. The assessment of the damage, what exactly happened, the information is there but it is not in the public domain. That again is the decision of the government.
I don’t think we should look at it as one huge battle campaign and whether its objectives were met. People went, they came back, there were no casualties; for us, we couldn’t have asked for more.The primary difference between the past (operations) and this one was in terms of scale and scope, which was much larger and, the fact that the government decided to go public with this one.
PRAVEEN SWAMI: Are surgical strikes the only way to respond to big attacks conceptually or should we be considering other ways of dealing with the situation?
I think we need to have a whole range of responses, both overt and covert, depending on what we want to do. We should not rule out any option.
SUSHANT SINGH: So why did we not respond with surgical strikes after the November 2016 attack on the Army base in Nagrota, J&K?
We should not look at it like that. Also, not every operation is made public. How else do you deal with the threat from Pakistan?
PRAVEEN SWAMI: What, in your view, would be the benchmarks that would allow for a phased withdrawal of the Indian Army from a counter-insurgency situation?
It is very difficult to say. There has to be an assessment over a period of time. We have de-inducted two divisions from the Jammu region. In the past, we have pulled out troops from Kashmir and moved them into the Ladakh region. Actually, if you see, there has been a fairly steady reduction (of security forces). You don’t see it in the Kashmir Valley because everyone wears the same uniform. The CRPF and the Army are sort of wearing the same uniform and standing on the streets. Road protection is largely the responsibility of the CRPF, and you see so many of their men on the road that it appears like a huge militarised society. We have thinned out a lot but some minimum presence is required.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: When the Army goes into an operational situation such as the one in Kashmir, there is always a withdrawal plan. And if that happens, will it be a political decision or a call that the Army will take?
I think it can’t be a purely military or political decision; it will be a joint call.
SEEMA CHISHTI: How is the insurgency in Kashmir different from that in the Northeast?
I commanded my division in Manipur and I have seen things fairly closely there. The basic principles while handling insurgencies is the same — a people-friendly approach, operations have to be conducted in small teams, locals shouldn’t be arrested etc. Having said that, the insurgency in the Northeast is completely different from J&K. In the Northeast, each state has a different dynamic. Also, the media doesn’t cover much of it.
ANANT GOENKA: On Kashmir, where does the relationship between the Army and the government stand as of today?
I think as far as our ability to advise the government is concerned, there are no problems there. Obviously the government gets advice from various agencies, the primary source being the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is actually supposed to deal with such a situation (Kashmir).
SUSHANT SINGH: Lieutenant General Praveen Bakshi served under you as Chief of Staff in the Northern Command. General Bipin Rawat was your colleague as an Army commander. What do you make of the fact that the government of the day superseded two senior officers and selected General Rawat as the Army chief?
The government had the power to take a decision and they have taken it. My suggestion is that time has passed and we need to put this behind us. I am saying this for two reasons: One, you have General Rawat as the chief and he needs all our support. As for Lt General Bakshi, I have known him personally, he is an outstanding professional and one of the most honourable men I have met. There was some chatter in the media, but we must put this behind us now.
SUSHANT SINGH: You have served in the Army for close to 40 years. Any regrets, or anything you would have done differently?
I don’t think so. Yes, there were times when I didn’t see certain things coming. For instance, when the Uri attacks took place, I went on record to say that it will all be over in 10 days. Things carried on for four months… One can sometimes misread the situation. Everything was not perfect, there are incidents you regret, that you wish hadn’t happened. Uri, beheading of somebody… but you know you have to take the good with the bad. Overall, the experience has been extremely satisfying.

At least 3,000 delegates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his ministers and BJP President Amit Shah, are set to attend the meet. It will conclude on September 25, the day Upadhyaya was born.
“As the Uri incident has taken place, it will obviously be discussed during the meeting,” BJP national Secretary P. Murlidharan, a former president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kerala unit, told IANS. Eighteen soldiers were killed when militants believed to have come from Pakistan attacked an army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday. The killings have sent India-Pakistan relations plunging to a new low.
The BJP has chosen this northern Kerala region for the mega event as Upadhyaya was elected president of the Jan Sangh, the BJP’s predecessor, in 1967 at a party conclave in Kozhikode. Murlidharan said the event will begin with a meeting of national office bearers and state presidents who will finalise the agenda of the council.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said Prime Minister Modi will arrive in the city on September 24 and will address a rally at Kozikokde. The National Council is also likely to devise a strategy for upcoming assembly elections in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.

Kerala BJP leaders feel the meeting will boost the party’s prospects in the state where it has just one member in the assembly and whose politics has for decades been dominated by the Left and the Congress. In this year’s assembly election in Kerala, the BJP opened its account and more than doubled its vote share from 7 to 15 per cent.
During the National Council meeting, the issue of violent clashes between Left and RSS cadres will also be taken up. According to BJP sources, the party is planning of a get together of all those who attended the session in this coastal city in 1967.
“Deendayal Upadhyaya had then talked about the Jan Sangh’s potential to become an alternative to the Congress and energised its cadres to become a national political force,” said party veteran O. Rajagopal, the only BJP legislator in Kerala. Rajagopal was among those who attended the 1967 Kozhikode session. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP veterans L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi also attended the session."

The top political leadership is of the view that on Uri it needs to demonstrate that it can walk its tough talk on Pakistan and terror and show a “discernible difference” vis a vis the UPA. As the government weighs its options, there is also a realisation within that it needs to address the call for “action,” especially from within its core constituency.
A senior political functionary said that the government’s action could come as mix of military, political and diplomatic responses played out in a series of steps to turn the heat on Pakistan. Some responses, by their very nature, will also need deniability, a source said. For one, the government is certain that all four terrorists came from Pakistan and will soon provide names of these terrorists along with other details.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held several high-level meetings to take stock of the situation and obtain the views of the Army and Air Force. He has also apprised himself, sources said, of what several officers and experts, including those from the Army, believe should be the next step. The political message, a source said, would be clear-cut: “India considers an Uri kind of attack not just an act of terror but an act of war by Pakistan.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
New Delhi is well aware that Pakistan will try to mobilize international support over any strong action India takes but it believes that the death of 18 soldiers has sparked off a groundswell of support for tough action. It believes that even Opposition parties would be constrained from openly criticizing offensive militant action, covert or overt.
As for the BJP’s core constituency, it wants the government to take some action.
At the same time, though, the Army and NSA Ajit Doval sound a word of caution that a response to the Uri attack should be firm but carefully thought out. Within the PMO, there is a view that the Uri attack has hit Pakistan hard. And, in the process, further marginalised separatists in the Valley. It is also felt that recent events have also weakened the civilian government of Nawaz Sharif and for all his bluster at the UN today, the jury is out on how this plays out as diplomatic pressure mounts on Pakistan."

Punjab Police and Border Security Force (BSF) on Sunday carried out a joint search operation and flag march in villages near Indo-Pak border, amid a heightened vigil in the wake of the Uri attack a week ago. The objective of carrying out search operation was to ensure safety, security and thwart any attempt by intruders coming from across the border, Pathankot police said.
As many as 150 security personnel including SWAT team members also participated in the search operation with Pathankot SP (Operation) Hem Pushp leading the Punjab police team. The operation was carried out in 12 villages, situated near Indo-Pak border and Jammu and Kashmir, which fall under Narot Jaimal Singh and Bamial police stations, police said.
The villages where search was conducted included Bamial, Dhalotar, Plah Vadda and Chhota, Bhupalpur, Dhinda and Dostpur. After the search operation, a flag march was also taken out by the security agencies, police said. On September 18, an alert was sounded in Punjab’s border districts of Pathankot and Gurdaspur following the terror strike on an army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 18 soldiers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Earlier this year, terrorists who had sneaked in from across the border had attacked Pathankot air base on the intervening night of January 1-2 while Dinanagar in Gurdaspur was targeted on July 27 last year. The Pathankot attack had claimed the lives of seven security personnel while four terrorists were killed.
Three heavily-armed terrorists wearing army fatigues had stormed a police station in Dinanagar town in Gurdaspur district last year killing seven persons, including a Superintendent of Police, before they were gunned down during a day-long operation."

LANCE NAIK RAJESH KUMAR YADAV, 35
DUBARDHA VILLAGE, BALLIA (UP)
The last ones in Ballia’s Dubardha village to get to know about Lance Naik Rajesh Kumar Yadav’s death in the Uri terror attack were his wife Parvati Devi, who is eight months pregnant, and his ailing mother Simariya Devi, who is a heart patient.
The villagers, along with other family of Rajesh, pulled out all stops to avoid breaking the news to the two women.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We erected barricades on the road leading to our house to ensure that no mediaperson or any relative could reach our house and talk about Rajesh’s death to my mother and his wife. We stopped everyone from visiting our house. But, some journalists managed to reach our home from the other side of the road and told about the death to Rajesh’s wife, Parvati, late in the afternoon,” said Rajesh’s youngest brother, Vikesh Yadav, who is a farmer.
He added that the family has “requested the district administration to arrange a doctor for emergency”.
Apart from Vikesh, Rajesh had two other brothers, Bhagwan and Rakesh. He is also survived by two daughters, Radhika, 8, and Preeti, 2.
Rajesh, who was posted in J&K for the last two years, had joined the Army 18 years ago. He had returned to Kashmir 20 days back after a two- month visit home.

“Four days ago, he called up and informed that he is being sent to Uri,” added Vikesh. Bittu Mishra, husband of village pradhan Madhubala Mishra, said: “The family has just three bighas land for farming. So, the entire family was dependent on Rajesh.”"

A day after India gave Pakistan details of two men who guided four terrorists to an Army camp in Uri where 18 soldiers were killed on September 18, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said it had discovered inaccuracies in biographical details of the two men.
NIA Inspector General Alok Mittal said Faisal Husain Awan, who was identified in a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) note given to Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit as a resident of Potha Jahangir in Muzaffarabad, is now recorded to be a resident of Halka 4 in Potha Jandgran near the village of Koomi Kote.

The second individual, identified in the MEA document as Yasin Khursheed, son of Mohammed Khurshid of Khiliana Kalan, was named by Mittal as Ahsan Khursheed, son of Chaudhury Khursheed of Mohalla Kidri in the village of Khilayana Khurd in Muzaffarabad’s Hattian Bala tehsil.
Sources said the initial details were based on biographical information obtained while the men were in custody from September 20 to 26.
MEA spokesperson Vikas Swaroop told The Indian Express that the suspects’ personal particulars were based on their statements to investigators.
“There is obviously no way Indian investigators immediately verify these details on-ground in that part of Kashmir illegally occupied by Pakistan,” Swaroop said, “which is precisely why we shared the information with that country, and offered it consular access. We have absolutely nothing to hide.”
Faisal Awan’s hamlet, Potha Jandgran, is on an earth road leading out from the village of Chhatter, half an hour’s drive south of Muzaffarabad.

Ahsan Khursheed’s village lies in the jurisdiction of Chinari police station, half an hour’s drive from the Kaman Post on the Line of Control.
The MEA’s statement Tuesday said the men had been caught by local residents and handed over to the Army, an account also corroborated by Uri residents.
NIA officers said they were still working to verify the particulars of the testimony.
“A lot will depend on whether technical experts are able to obtain data from the damaged Global Positioning System set we have salvaged from the encounter site,” an investigator said, “which we can then tally with the suspects’ accounts to see if it is credible”.
The men, a source familiar with the investigation said, had frequently changed their account, first telling villagers who caught them that they had accidentally strayed across the Line of Control.
Later, though, the men gave varying accounts to interrogators. In one account, they claimed they had crossed the Line of Control on September 20, after the Uri attack.
And then, while speaking to a doctor who treated them for injuries at the barracks where they were held in Srinagar, the men claimed to have been part of the Uri terror squad itself, saying they had set alight tents with troops asleep in them using three LPG cylinders, the source said.
An NIA spokesperson said the two men had been brought to Delhi for further interrogation. “They have been remanded to 10 days’ police custody, up to October 7,” the spokesperson said."

Lt General (retired) D S Hooda, who was the Northern Army Commander in September 2016 when Indian troops carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control in the wake of the Uri attack, Friday said the “overhype” of the strikes did not help and “it is not good” when “military operations get politicised”.
Moderating a discussion on the ‘Role of Cross-Border Operations and Surgical Strikes’ at the ongoing Military Literature Festival, Hooda said following the surgical strikes, there were accusations that the issue had been politicised, that there was an “attempt to keep a purely military operation in the political domain by selective leaks of videos, photographs etc”.
“Did the overhype help? I say, completely no. If you start having political resonance in military operations, it is not good. There was too much political banter, on both sides, and when military operations get politicised, that is not good,” he said. On the possibility of the strikes impacting the thought process of decision-makers in future operations, the former Army Commander said “if you hype a successful operation, then even success has its burden”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“Will we think next time (what) if there are casualties? Because it has been so overhyped, will it impose caution on leadership? What happens if it does not have the same level of success? It may impose some caution in future. If we had done it quietly, it would have been much better,” he said.
Responding to remarks from panelists that the strikes were purely tactical in nature with short-term goals and of no strategic value to deter the Pakistan Army from backing future terror attacks, Hooda said: “When we were planning it, there was no thought in our mind that Pakistan will stop doing Uri-like incidents. At least in the Northern Command, there was simplicity of purpose. For us, it was very simple,” he said.
He said ever since 2013-end, terrorists had been coming from across the LoC to attack Army installations in Samba, Hiranagar, Janglote, Pathankot and Uri. “Since July 2016, Army had been under pressure due to protests following (militant commander) Burhan Wani’s death. The Chief of Army Staff flew in and we went to Uri. We walked in three-inch-deep ashes of the camp which had been attacked. There was no doubt in our mind that we had to do something and we had to hit Pakistan camps across the LoC. You may call it revenge but in our mind, this had to be done,” he said.
The aim of the strikes, he said, could not have been fulfilled through artillery fire. “We had had massive artillery duels but it was not helping. Planning had been going on in advance. We pulled out our old plans, refurbished them a bit and sent the Special Forces across. Should it have been publicised? There was no option. Too many questions were being asked. The media and our own Army soldiers were asking, ‘what are we doing about so many deaths of soldiers’,” he said.




	From Express Archives : Idea Exchange with Lt Gen Hooda




He said following the surgical strikes, the Army noted a “fair amount of panic” on the Pakistani side. “Their leaves were cancelled. We caught their chatter on radio. There was talk that we might repeat it in some area. There was fair amount of shock on their part as to how have these guys come in and done this operation. This did impose caution on them in some limited sense,” he said.
Responding to a question from the audience, Hooda said in hindsight, it would have been better had the strikes been done secretly."

As the nation continues to reel from the Uri terror attack, a tone of anti-terrorism is likely to dominate the three-day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Conclave, which began on Friday at Kozhikode in Kerala and where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to make his first public address since the deadly attack in which 18 Indian soldiers were killed.
The party also sought to focus on the Antyodaya programme as part of its pro-poor agenda. Party President Amit Shah asked its BJP ruled states to execute the schemes aimed at the welfare of the poor in the centenary birth anniversary year of its ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

Briefing media on Friday evening BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav said, it is an occasion for the party to rededicate itself to Upadhyay’s ideals. He also made it clear that the Uri terror attack in which 18 soldiers were martyred will be deliberated in the Council.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Prime Minister Modi will reach Kozhikode on a two-day visit on Saturday. He will fly down to Karipur in the afternoon where he will address a public rally at five in the evening on the Kozhikode beach.
He will also participate in the National Council meet.
The entire government machinery, including Prime Minister’s Office will function from Kozhikode for two days, since many of the Central Ministers are participating in the National Council of BJP."

(Source: PTI)
Pakistan today claimed that India has not shared any evidence about the assault on an army camp in Uri town in Kashmir that left 18 Indian soldiers dead and accused India of blaming others for terror attacks.
Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria said Pakistan would wait for any investigation by India into the Uri attack.

“I want to draw a distinction between evidence and information. What they have shared with us is just a piece of paper. In the previous incidents too, there has been exchange of papers. We are waiting for details to come,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said Pakistan cannot comment prior to independent investigation report of the Uri attack.
He alleged that India was desperate to divert attention from Kashmir and had demonstrated capability of staging terrorists attack on its soil and blaming it on others.
“We have seen time and again that India would blame another country for terrorist activity and somewhere down the line it would turn out to be the handiwork of its own security agencies. A glaring example of this is the Samjhauta Express terrorist attack in Feb 2007,” he said.
Zakaria said “unprovoked violations on the LoC by the Indian security forces” killed two Pakistani soldiers.
Commenting on the situation in Kashmir, he said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif effectively highlighted in the UN and apprised the world community about it.
He said Pakistan will continue to raise the issue of Kashmir at the UN, OIC and all other international forums as also with the HR Organizations across the world.
The spokesperson said Pakistan remains committed to extending complete diplomatic, political and moral support to the Kashmiris’ movement for self-determination.
He said Pakistan had learnt “India’s unfortunate decision of not attending the Summit” and alleged that India has a track record of impeding the SAARC process.
He said that India’s negative attitude has had a direct bearing on the welfare and betterment in this region, “which is highly regrettable”.
To a question that India was isolating Pakistan, he said Pakistan cannot be isolated by mere statements of the Indian Prime Minister.
“Pakistan enjoys friendly and close relations with the comity of nations and Prime Minister of Pakistan’s engagements on the sidelines of the 71st UNGA session, China’s massive investments, joint exercises with Russia, visit of Iranian Naval ships, signing of mega project agreements with Central Asian States, Russia, China and International Financial Institutions make Indian claim a laughing stock,” he said.
He said Pakistan had not received any formal communication from India on Indus Water treaty, which is binding on both India and Pakistan and has no exit provision.
“According to the sub-provisions (3) and (4) of the Article XII of the IWT, the Treaty cannot be altered or revoked unilaterally,” he said."

Britain has expressed serious concern over the growing tension between India and Pakistan in the wake of Uri terror attack, asking both nuclear powers to ease it off.
“Britain wants easing of tension between Pakistan and India as it is concerned over the current situation (in the wake of Uri attack),” British High Commissioner in Pakistan Thomas Drew said on Saturday.

Drew met Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif in Lahore and discussed matters of mutual interest, promotion of bilateral relations and the situation in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to a release issued by the Punjab government, the British High Commissioner said, “Like other countries, Britain also wants easing of tension between Pakistan and India. Britain is concerned over the tension between the two countries. It is against violation of human rights anywhere in the world”.
He said Pakistan’s political leadership is showing a responsible attitude in the current situation.
Drew said Shahbaz Sharif was the first foreign leader who telephoned Teresa May on her nomination as the Prime Minister of Britian and conveyed good wishes for her.
“British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to visit Pakistan next year,” he said.
Sharif said Britain should play its role in resolution of the Kashmir issue in the light of UN resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people.
He said Pakistan is a peaceful country and wants durable peace in the region."

The Uri terror strike is aimed at triggering fresh violence in Jammu and Kashmir and creating a “war-like” situation in the region, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said today while strongly condemning the attack on the Army in which 17 jawans were killed. “I strongly condemn the attack which seems to be aimed at triggering fresh violence and creating a war-like situation in the region,” Mehbooba said in a statement here. The Chief Minister said the heightened tension in the wake of the Uri attack is set to further vitiate the atmosphere in and around Jammu and Kashmir amid growing strains in Indo-Pak ties.

“Unfortunately, people in Jammu and Kashmir, who are already mired in an agonising situation, shall have to bear the maximum brunt of the fresh attempts being made to step up violence and trigger fresh bloodshed in the state,” she said. She said Jammu and Kashmir has always been the worst victim of Indo-Pak hostility and its people have been paying a colossal price for the same for the past over six decades. Mehbooba said the perpetrators of violence must understand that such methods have yielded nothing in the past nor would they yield anything in future except adding to the miseries of the people.
The Chief Minister while expressing anguish over the attack, paid rich tributes to the slain soldiers. She extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and also prayed for early recovery of those injured in the attack. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah also condemned the attack. “Terrible news from Uri, 17 soldiers killed & many injured. May their souls rest in peace. Prayers for their families as also for the injured,” Omar wrote on Twitter.

Heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the Army in North Kashmir’s Uri town in the wee hours today, killing 17 jawans and injuring 19 other personnel in the terror strike in which four ultras were neutralised."

The NIA Tuesday took into custody the two men from PoK arrested by Army in connection with its probe into the attack at an Army camp in Uri even as it established the identity of one of the four slain attackers as belonging to PoK. The NIA took over the custody of the two men identified as Ahasan Kursheed alias DC, a resident of Khaliana Kalan and Faisal Hussain Awan, a resident of Pottha Jahangir — both in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and would produce them before a designated court soon, official sources said.

The two were arrested by the BSF and the Army in a joint operation at ‘Angoor Post’ at Gavalata village in Uri last Saturday when they were trying to infiltrate into India. With both being residents of PoK, the army authorities interrogated them whether they had any knowledge about the attack in which four terrorists had stormed an Army camp at Uri on September 18 and killed 18 soldiers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The duo initially claimed that they had inadvertently crossed into India but after sustained interrogation they not only informed the security agencies about the two guides who had helped the terrorists to infiltrate but also helped them in identifying one of the terrorist involved in the attack, the sources said.
One of the killed terrorist was identified by NIA as Hafiz Ahmed of Darbang in Muzaffarabad Tehsil of PoK. The duo would be brought to the national capital where they would undergo scientific tests and also subjected to an interrogation by joint team of security agencies. The two had been recruited initially by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed(JeM) for guiding its militants to infiltrate across the LoC and later they helped other militant groups as well, the sources said."

(Source: ANI)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the “pain” of the people of Balochistan, the leadership of which has sought India’s help for the “first time in 70 years”, a prominent Baloch leader said here today.
Activist Mazdak Dilshad Baloch expressed satisfaction with the Indian response to the “Baloch appeal”, saying Modi’s Independence Day speech had played “a major role in spreading awareness” about the “atrocities” of the Pakistani State on Balochistan.

But, during the event on ‘Baloch Nationality’ where the young leader spoke, social commentator Tarek Fatah countered his claim, saying exiled Baloch leader Brahumdagh Bugti had been to India for medical treatment.
Bugti has recently sought asylum in India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“India is with us. Narendra Modi understands our pain. In the last 70 years, no Baloch leader has come to India. But now, we have come and we are happy with the response. We thank (External Affairs Minister) Sushma Swaraj for her UNGA speech.
“Today, even an autowallah asks me whether I am the same Baloch Modiji spoke about. Since August 15, I have had many such encounters,” Mazdak said.
He also took a dig at Pakistan over the recent surgical strikes of the Indian Army on terror launchpads in PoK and the subsequent denial of the Pakistani civilian and military leadership of the same, saying “everyone knows” who staged the attack on the army base at Uri in Kashmir.
Describing as “false” the distinction made between the Pakistani State and its people, Mazdak questioned the latter’s “silence” on the “acts of oppression” at Balochistan. “But, they voiced their opposition against the terror attack in Paris,” he said.
The event, organised by right-wing thinktank India Policy Foundation and attended by many at Constitution Club, was punctuated with slogans of “Bharat Mata ki Jai” and “Pakistan Murdabad”.
BJP MP Udit Raj was present in the audience.
Former diplomat Vivek Katju, who termed the Baloch issue the “unfinished agenda of partition”, and retired armyman GD Bakshi were among the other speakers at the event. A booklet, titled ‘Balochistan: What World Needs to Know’, was released on the occasion.
However, Mazdak put Kashmir in the same bracket with Balochistan and Sindh while speaking about the aspiration for “freedom” of the people of these places.
“Baloch people are being tortured, executed…bodies are dropped from aircraft to create terror…the worst part is, they enjoy killing us,” he said, claiming that the Baloch leadership had approached (independent India’s first Prime Minister) Jawaharlal Nehru, but did not get a “favourable response”.
Mazdak claimed that “99 per cent” of the Baloch Sardars were “siding with the Pakistani State” as they were “opportunists”, adding that the movement was being led by the “common men and not one or two leaders”.
IPF Director Rakesh Sinha hit out at Amnesty International, the Western powers and UNHCR for “making noises” on Kashmir, but “turning a blind eye” towards Balochistan. “They work with an agenda,” he alleged.
A functionary of the foundation also took a dig at Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for “not criticising” the Uri attack. “Our soldiers are fighting at the borders. We need to isolate the apologists within the country,” he said."

Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Monday expelled a student from Kashmir for allegedly posting a derogatory comment on the terror attack in Uri on Facebook.
Police have also lodged an FIR against the student.
“The student, Mudassar Yusuf from Srinagar, offered his apologies to me for posting the comment. He said he was carried away by sentiments. But I told him that he had been expelled from the university,” AMU Vice-Chancellor Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah said.
Aligarh SSP Rajesh Pandey said an FIR had been filed against Yusuf for his derogatory comment on the death of soldiers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The SHO of Civil Lines police station, where the FIR was lodged, said Yusuf — who is pursuing MSc in organic chemistry — has been booked under Section 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC. The Aligarh district administration has sought an explanation from AMU in the matter.
Satish Kumar Gautam, BJP MP from Aligarh, has also written to the V-C demanding stringent action against the student.

Mudassar Yusuf could not be contacted for comments."

Our troubled relationship with Pakistan has been in free fall since the Uri terror attack a year ago. The 2003 ceasefire has all but collapsed. India lost 82 security personnel to terrorist violence in J&K in 2016 and the number this year has already crossed 50. We have followed an avowedly “muscular” policy in recent years, its essence summed up in six words: “Terror and talks cannot go together”. But what thereafter?
Our national debate on relations with Pakistan centres essentially around the false “dialogue vs no dialogue” binary, which does not address the complexity of the situation or serve our interest.
Pakistan is not a monolith when it comes to India. Their army, its terror proxies and political protégés regard India as an eternal enemy and spike all peace moves. Confrontation with India serves the army’s institutional interest. Therefore, engagement with the “real power centre” in Pakistan, proposed by some, has serious limitations. However, a large body of opinion in Pakistan favours a stable relationship with India. It includes leaders of major political parties, capable of winning power through elections, who realise the utility of a better relationship in undermining the army’s salience, and large sections of business and industry which eye economic opportunities in India. The focus of the people at large, like people everywhere else, is on bread and butter issues.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Therefore, the India relationship was not an issue of even marginal consequence during the elections of 2008 and 2013. Periods of tension, such as the ongoing phase, and jingoistic rhetoric in India, consolidate support for the worldview of the army, seen as the saviour.
Not knowing how to take their dubious Kashmir agenda forward, Pakistan seeks the fig leaf of dialogue on Kashmir to keep the issue alive. When India refuses such dialogue, they go back to their default position of stirring up trouble in the Valley, helped by New Delhi’s failure to win people over there. The Pakistan army has shown no sign of renouncing terror, seen as a low cost option to bleed India.
The eight-track dialogue format used in every phase of structured dialogue since 1997, while offering the face-saver of talks on Kashmir to Pakistan, also addressed India’s need to keep the focus on terror. Improving upon this format would be extremely difficult. Our frustration with dialogue stems from our regarding it as a concession in return for which Pakistan should become a normal state and abnegate terror. This is not going to happen anytime soon because of Pakistan’s internal dynamics. We have to deal with Pakistan as it is and not as we want it to be.
However, dialogue has the potential to promote a lesser, nonetheless important goal from our point of view of managing the relationship so that its violent swings do not distract us from bigger challenges such as economic transformation and an increasingly assertive China, and relative calm and stability prevail along the LoC/international border in the J&K sector. It also facilitates engagement with the segment of opinion in Pakistan that favours a better relationship. In the past, it has helped us in making gains, albeit incrementally, in areas such as trade and people to people contacts that are anathema to Pakistan’s security establishment.
Let’s take a look at some policy options that were intensely debated post-Uri. We have not developed the infrastructure to use fully our own share of water under the Indus Waters Treaty, let alone divert Pakistan’s share as an effective coercive measure. Our priority should be to fully utilise our own share. Bilateral trade is heavily in our favour — Indian exports are of 1.5 to 2 billion dollars per annum and Pak exports of 300-500 million dollars. We surely do not wish to mirror Pakistan’s short-sighted policy of forsaking lucrative trade for political reasons. Think of those whose livelihood depends upon it.
A diplomatic campaign to isolate Pakistan assumes that the international community is unaware of their deep links with terror. All countries know this too well, but act according to their own interests. No other country is going to pull our chestnuts out of fire.
We have to essentially deal with this problem ourselves. The nuclear dimension has constrained use of our conventional military superiority to coerce Pakistan into changing its behaviour. However, our army is capable of giving as good as it gets on the LoC. While using the terror card brazenly, Pakistan’s security establishment forgets that Pakistan too has several faultlines, not confined to Balochistan alone, that can be exploited by others as a deterrent against Pak-sponsored terror.
The above realities do not lend themselves to black and white solutions. Therefore, we need to manage the relationship by combining dialogue with deterrence. Dialogue does not rule out deterrence so long as it is exercised discreetly to send a message to those perpetrating violence and not as a tool of point-scoring and jingoistic media debates. The ongoing political turmoil in Pakistan, which will take time to settle down, rules out a serious attempt to stabilise the relationship for the time being.
In the meanwhile, we should develop a political consensus on a broad policy framework, based on rational and pragmatic approaches, so that the government of the day does not have to look over its shoulder before taking every step and our policy is not held hostage to the most strident voices in our TV studios."

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National Council will adopt a resolution strongly condemning Pakistan for the recent Uri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday.
According to reports, the Council will discuss all issues of national interest and concentrate on the party strategy in different states. The party’s three-day conclave at Kozhikode in Kerala will culminate today with the national council meeting.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the year-long birth centenary celebrations of Deen Dayal Upadhyay this evening. The Prime Minister has urged the former Jan Sangh and the new generation BJP leaders to fulfil the dreams of Deen Dayal Upadhyay.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Yesterday, describing terrorism as enemy of the entire humanity, Prime Minister Modi said Pakistani leaders are talking about a having thousands of years of war with India. He also asserted that he is prepared to take up this challenge and that the day is not far off when the people of Pakistan will come out to fight against terrorism.
Prime Minister Modi also warned the Pakistani leadership that the Uri attack won’t be forgotten and that the sacrifice of 18 soldiers would not go in vain. He said India would mount an all-out offensive to isolate Pakistan diplomatically to expose its activities in exporting terror."

As India looks for options, including diplomatic and military action, to avenge the killing of 18 soldiers in Uri, Pakistan is making all efforts to counter India’s strategy on all fronts. But with most countries giving it a cold shoulder, Pakistan is keeping its forces ready for forthcoming challenges. And with Indian forces foiling infiltration bids in separate operations at the LoC on Tuesday, Pakistan looks a little nervous.
According to intelligence inputs, Pakistan Rangers has cancelled the leave of its personnel deployed along the Indo-Pak border in J&K and Punjab in apprehension of a retaliation from Indian forces. The number of Pakistan Rangers deployed along the border have also been increased and the gaps which existed in their deployment due to shortage of manpower have also been filled, according to sources.

Also Pakistan’s national flag carrier cancelled flights to northern Pakistani cities including Gilgit due to “air space restrictions”. Without disclosing any reason, the spokesperson of the Pakistan International Airlines tweeted “As per directives of CAA (Civil Aviation Authority), the air space over Northern areas will remain closed on Wednesday. Inconvenience regretted.” However, officials said Pakistani warplanes might be in the air to keep vigil due to Indo-Pak tensions after the Uri attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
There are reasons for Pakistan to be in a frenzy. After Russia and France, the United States also aksed Pakistan to prevent itself from being used as a safe heaven for terrorists. According to reports, US President Barack Obama refused to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif before his UN address. In the meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry, Sharif raised the issue of alleged human rights violations and killings in Kashmir and sought American help to resolve the Kashmir issue, but was told to restrict terror activity.
A bipartisan group of two powerful American lawmakers introduced a bill in the US House of Representatives to designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus tweeted a story which said the Indian Army had suffered its biggest stack in a decade.

The snubbing by the US has toned down Sharif’s rhetoric to reduce tensions with India. He was expected to forcefully highlight the Kashmir violence during his UN speech, but the scenario changed after Uri terrorist attack which spotlighted the issue of cross-border militancy. “The prime minister might strike a balance in his speech. He would talk about the Indian atrocities in Kashmir, but also would be conciliatory to end tension,” said an official from the Prime Minister’s Office. Sharif held a telephonic conversation with Army Chief General Raheel Sharif, the first after the Uri attack, but no statement was issued after the talks."

After the decks were today cleared for the smooth release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s cine wing said they won’t oppose the release of other two films Raees and Dear Zindagi which star Pakistani actors. Director Karan Johar accompanied by Producers’ Guild President Mukesh Bhatt met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and assured him that filmmakers would not work with Pakistani artistes given the people’s sentiments in India post Uri attacks.
Fadnavis met Johar and Bhatt at his residence ‘Varsha’ here this morning along with MNS chief Raj Thackeray, whose party had been opposing the release of the upcoming movie as Pakistani actor Fawad Khan features in the film.
While Fawad has a special appearance in the romantic- drama, Pakistani actress Mahira Khan will be making her Bollywood debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in “Raees” and in Dear Zindagi Ali Zafar is one of the actors paired opposite Alia Bhatt.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When asked if Raees will be met with the same opposition as that of “Ae Dil…”, working president of Maharashtra Navnirman Chitrapat Karmachari Sena, Shalini Thackeray said.
“They always said that these films were shot before the (Uri) attack happened.
“So, in today’s meeting, it became clear that apart from the three films which have been completed– ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’, ‘Raees’ and ‘Dear Zindagi’ — no other films with Pakistani artistes will be released.
“No films with Pakistani actors will be shot. This was decided by the CM, MNS, and producers guild together.”
She was speaking at a panel discussion about Pakistani artistes working in Bollywood at Aaj Tak’s special event ‘Manthan’. Actors like Ashurosh Rana, Dalip Tahil and adman Prahlad Kakkar were present at the event.
Rana said he was happy that the issue of “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” was resolved, but asked why only put an end to actors working in Bollywod and continue business relations with Pakistan.
“Why only cinema? I believe it should not be limited to arts. If it is about money, then what about cement electricity? Let us say ‘we don’t want to keep any relations with you. It should be decided by the government. To impose a ban on arts, culture is somewhere a half-hearted attempt,” he said.
Tahil opined that under the current circumstances, film industry should understand and respect the sentiments of people.
“Considering the situation, there should be a total boycott of Pakistan. In trade, culture, every way. What happened was, after the Uri and Mumbai attack, people are enraged. But as a film industry we should realise the sentiments of the public and respect that.
“Cultural exchange happens with two hands. Our artistes and singers have been humiliated there,” Tahil added."

Dear Karan Johar,
You don’t know me. As an introduction of sorts, let me tell you: I was the guy who many months ago wrote “Hang Ujjal Dosanjh for treason before charging Aamir Khan with sedition” in response to attacks on him for voicing his wife’s fears about the then brewing and now surging fanatical storm in India.
I have been out of India since 1964. I was an eighteen-year-old young man, born and raised in relative poverty, who left India and over the years had to become a Canadian citizen to be able to practice law so that I could “bring home the bacon” as we say in the West. Please understand the expression has no religious connotations. It connotes only the responsibility of the parent to put food, vegetarian or non, on the table so it could go into the mouths of his/her hungry children.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

So I understand why you have made a deal with the devil of fanaticism to have your movie run without violent and fanatic thugs burning the movie theatres in a felt rage of vengeance against Pakistani terrorists, sponsored by a terrorist military that owns Pakistan, a country run by an invalid Sharif government.
You and I both know that Pakistani madrassas and military are in the business of churning out thousands of fanatics ready to attack ‘infidel’ India in the name of Wahabi Islamic terror funded by Saudi money. By and large Indians, including the Indian Muslims, have rejected the call of fanaticism. India has largely escaped the most vicious Islamist poison of Wahabi terror. That speaks to India’s tremendous ability to absorb unanticipated military or cultural shocks–an ability we know well from our reading of Indian history.
As an Indian overseas, I understood and supported the surgical strikes following the dastardly Uri attack. But I also know as I am sure do you, that many Pakistanis just like Indians, want peace on our borders between the two countries. If the Pakistani actor/s in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil were fanatics harbouring hate against India, or were afraid of the India-hating military and the terrorists trained and funded by it, they would never have dared or agreed to work in your film. You must admire their courage.
I can tell you from personal experience standing against a storm of religious fanaticism is no easy task. Several years ago I took unending abuse and several poundings of an iron bar on my head in fighting the Khalistanis in Canada. Every thump of the iron bar on my skull made me more determined to fight them. The Indian and a lover of freedom of expression in me kept thinking “How dare they?”
Also Read: Karan Johar on Ae Dil Hai Mushkil controversy: I will not work with Pakistani talent in future
I want to say to you that I understand all the financial compulsions that made you say that you will never ever have Pakistanis act in your movies. To ensure your movie was allowed to run in theatres in India you surrendered your freedoms and mine to a few fanatics and goons of the MNS–the self styled definers of Indian patriotism. And you know patriotism is often the last refuge of scoundrels.
I was sad that you so surrendered your freedom of expression. I am sure you know and remember the words of the prominent protestant pastor Martin Niemoller and a great foe of Adolf Hitler. I reproduce them here for you and all of us to remember:
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out–

Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not

speak out–

Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not

speak out–

Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me–and there was no one

left to speak for me.
I am sad that you surrendered to the forces of darkness and despotism; but even sadder that not many others from the land of Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Lohia and JP had the courage to speak out."

Further deepening the already close defence ties will be a major focus of Israeli President Reuven Rivlin’s eight-day trip to India beginning Monday during which both sides are also set to ink a number of MoUs to expand cooperation in areas of energy, agriculture and trade.
Ahead of Rivlin’s visit here, first by an Israeli President in nearly two decades, the Jewish country’s envoy Daniel Carmon said the bilateral defence ties were beyond buyer-seller and military-to-military relationship and the message will be to broaden it further besides boosting cooperation in some other sectors.
Watch what else making news

During his stay, the Israeli President will hold extensive talks with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi covering key bilateral and regional issues besides attending a ceremony in Taj Hotel and Chabad House in Mumbai to pay tribute to victims of 26/11 attack in which six Jews were also killed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On defence cooperation, Carmon said Israel has plans for fresh joint ventures and technology transfer in developing weapons systems and ensuring implementation of Modi’s Make in India initiative in the key sector which is a “major facet” of his country’s “special relationship” with India.
“It is a very deep relationship. India and Israel enjoy very unique relation in areas of defence…. There are plans for fresh joint venture and technology transfer,” he told reporters, refusing to go into specifics.
India is Israel’s largest buyer of military hardware and the latter has been supplying various weapons systems, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles over the last few years but the transactions have largely remained behind the curtains.
Carmon said Rivlin’s “large” delegation will comprise honchos of top Israeli arms manufacturing companies and senior government officials dealing with matters relating to defence. Asked about Modi’s proposed visit to Israel, he said it will happen and will be a very important trip. It was being decided by the two governments when it will happen, the envoy said.
There were indications that the Prime Minister may visit Tel Aviv in first part of 2017 which will be 25th year of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries. India had established “full” diplomatic relationship with Israel in 1992 though it had recognised the country in 1950.
Asked about the proposed Free Trade Agreement between the two countries, he said its finalisation “should and could be a easier process henceforth”. The envoy said both countries are set to sign a raft of pacts in areas of education, energy, water, agriculture and research and development during Rivlin’s visit.
On Modi comparing India’s cross LoC military action against terror launchpads following Uri attack to Israeli-type response, the envoy said his country had to develop robust capability to protect its citizens, considering the geo-political situation.
He said Israel was ready to share with India its technology and enhance security ties. In October last year, President Mukherjee had visited Israel, the first by an Indian head of state. Rivlin will also visit Chandigarh where he will inaugurate an Agro Tech conference along with Mukherjee. President Rivlin will head business and academic delegations including chancellors of 12 Israeli universities as well as Israeli companies, some of which are already active and successful in India.
He said at least 15 MoUs are likely to be signed between Indian and Israeli educational institutions during the visit. Identifying agriculture and water conservation as key areas of cooperation, he said the number of agri centres set up by Israel in India will go up from current 15 to 40. The visit will focus on strengthening the ever growing economic ties between India and Israel in the fields of agriculture and water, and promoting academic cooperation, he said.
Asked about India attempting to strengthen ties with countries like Iran, UAE and Saudi Arabia, the envoy said Indo-Israel bilateral ties were not affected by New Delhi’s relationship with other nations.
In Agra, the Israeli President will visit Taj Mahal and an Israeli water treatment plant. He will also visit the Indo-Israeli Agricultural Project’s Center of Excellence in Karnal."

‘Friendships Across Borders: Aao Dosti Karein’ is Modi’s initiative that aims to promote interfaith dialogue among school students in India and Pakistan, using social media that is border-free.

So students of a handful of schools in Mumbai have been asked to share their stories with their Pakistani counterparts, and then share their Pakistani friends’ stories on social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chintan said, “The students participate in interactive sessions that involve art activities, theatre exercises, creative writing, watching videos and discussing them, quizzes, etc. Through these, they are encouraged to think creatively and critically instead of being bogged down by cynicism or hopelessness. They take responsibility, and come up with solution.”
In Mumbai, students of Shishuvan School and Ecole Mondiale International School have written letters addressed across the border and the replies they got was overwhelming. This activity helped the students realise how their lives are so very similar to the students of Pakistan.
A workshop was also held for teachers of Vidya India, an NGO. The teachers Skyped with Anam Zakhaariya, an educator based in Lahore. The conversation capped several topics ranging from atmosphere, daily lifestyle to Bollywood and Pakistani serials.
Vaishnavi Vaidyanath, a teacher at Vidya, said, “This session was a stepping stone in our journey to eradicate misgivings about our neighbours. We need this kind of interactive sessions with them if we are to ever achieve peace. In my opinion these sessions need to be held for teachers elsewhere too as teachers are the ones that mould our future generation.”
Based in Mumbai, Chintan conducts the workshops across India and Pakistan and has travelled to Mumbai, Panchgani, Vadodara, Lucknow, Trivandrum, Pondicherry, Hyderabad, Chennai, Chandigarh, Ambala, Islamabad and Lahore to spread his message.
He added, “Our agenda is to transform hostility into hope. Some students have grandparents who left their homes during the partition and settled and started a new life in India. This brings a personal element into the discussion around India-Pakistan relations.”Mumbai NewsMumbai curfew: BMC allows 24-hours food delivery, movement of house helpsMaharashtra: Entertainment bodies to write to CM to allow production work, support daily-wage workersDecongest jails: Bombay HC suggests transfer of inmates to Paithan open prison to take care of cattle, farmingClick here for more

On 22nd evening, Rashtriya Rifles gunner Pitabas Majhi had called up his wife Bedamati from Uri, telliing her that he would be at home on 25th.
But little did Majhi, 30, a gunner with Army’s elite counter-insurgency unit 34 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion since 2008, know that his body would arrive at his native village Danajhola in Komna block of Nuapara district. “He seemed so happy and told his wife that his leave application has been approved and he would dance after reaching home,” said his uncle Bhuban Singh Majhi. The young gunner married since 2013 was expecting his first child in a month’s time and was expectedly eager to meet his wife.

Shortly after he spoke to his wife, the tribal Armyman went on a combing operation in Uri and was injured in gunfire. Majhi’s family member tried speaking to him next day, but the phone was unreachable. “We got restive but we had no other way to contact him. On September 23, we heard unconfirmed news of Pitabas having been injured. My daughter-in-law stopped eating,” said Majhi’s father Rudra Singh Majhi. The final confirmation came yesterday evening when a team from Komna police station reached their home and told about the young Armyman succumbing to his injuries at the 92 Base Hospital of the Army in Srinagar.

As the tricolour-draped body of Majhi in a casket arrived from Raipur and reached Danajhla, thousands of people lined up both sides of village road to have a glimpse of him. Slogans of “Pitabas Majhi Amar Rahe” and “Bharat Mata ki jai” rent the air. Nuapara district collector Mohammed Alam and SP MS Sampat laid wreaths on the casket amid 21 gun salute by local police. Majhi was later cremated in his own paddyfield as per local tribal customs. “He was the first Army recruit from our village. We will always miss him,” said schoolmate Akshay Panigrahi.
Majhi, who had last come home on August 26 during Rathyatra was the mainstay of the household. He had made their house a concrete one last year with his salary. “He was instrumental in looking after his 5 other brothers and their families with his own income,” said his uncle."

Almost immediately after a suicide bomber rammed into a CRPF convoy in Awantipora, killing at least 40 security personnel, the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), claimed responsibility for the terror strike. The attack bore the JeM’s signature. Since 2000, when a 17-year-old blew up an explosive-laden Maruti car which he had driven to the headquarters of the Army’s 15 Corps in Srinagar, suicide strikes have been one of Jaish’s preferred methods. The 2000 Srinagar attack had announced the arrival on the terror stage of Maulana Masood Azhar. Released a few months earlier, in late 1999, from an Indian jail in exchange of the crew and passengers of an Indian Airlines aircraft that was hijacked and taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan, Azhar took the help of the Afghan Taliban to form the JeM. Its attack on Parliament in 2001 almost pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war. A few months earlier, Islamabad had used the term “terrorism” to condemn a JeM attack on the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly. However, even though it outlawed the outfit in 2002, forced in large measure by international pressure, Islamabad has allowed it to operate under different names — Afzal Guru Squad, Al-Murabitoon and Tehreek-al-Furqan — while Azhar remains under nominal house arrest in Bahawalpur. Pakistan’s denials of his involvement in terror flies in the face of the JeM’s ownership of Thursday’s attack. Its ally, China, has stone-walled India’s attempts at the UN to have Azhar declared a global terrorist.
After lying low for nearly 10 years, the JeM has upped the ante in the last three years. In November 2015, it claimed responsibility for an attack on the Brigade Headquarter at Tangdhar, very close to the LoC in Kupwara district. India has also blamed the outfit for the January 2016 attack on the Pathankot airbase, in which seven security personnel were killed and the September 2016 Uri attack which claimed the lives of 20 soldiers. In the last two years, security forces have killed at least two JeM commanders in the Valley.
Thursday’s attacks should bring into focus India’s security challenge in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw his country’s troops from Afghanistan. With Kabul’s current regime under President Ashraf Ghani sidelined in the peace talks, the Taliban, which currently holds sway over 45 per cent of Afghanistan, looks set to return to the country’s political centrestage. The outfit has maintained it will not go back to terrorism, but that could be a bargaining ploy. On its part, the JeM has never shied away from its umbilical connection to the Taliban. Russia and China, both of whom have advocated a role for the Taliban in Afghanistan, have condemned Thursday’s attacks. But it is evident that the first step towards addressing India’s concerns would be bringing Azhar to book. It is time China reconsidered its position on the matter."

Accusing India of being involved in the many terror attacks that have plagued Pakistan for several years, Defence Minister Khawaja M Asif has claimed that the deadly terror strike on an Army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir was “self-generated” by India.
“India has been involved for several years in the many attacks that have taken place in Pakistan. And I firmly believe that the entire Uri incident is self generated by India,” Asif said in an interview to Samaa TV channel.

Following the Uri attack, the Defence Minister in a late night tweet had stated that blaming Pakistan for Uri and any attempt to escalate tension to deflect attention from state terrorism in Kashmir, will “prove expensive for Indians”.
Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had stated that Indian’s assertion that Islamabad was behind the Uri attack, was New Delhi’s “long-time habit”.
However, three days after the Uri attack in which 18 Army soldiers lost their lives, India summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and presented evidence of Pakistan’s role in the Uri terror attack as well as other strikes like Pathankot.
Displaying a list of proofs nailing Pakistan’s involvement in the recent terror attack, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Vikas Swarup emphasised that a number of items that include:
1. GPS from the bodies of terrorists with coordinates that indicate the point and time of infiltration across the LoC and the subsequent route to the terror attack site.
2. Grenades with Pakistani markings.
3. Communication matrix sheets
4. Communication equipment
5. Other stores made in Pakistan, including food, medicines and clothes.
Calling on the Pakistan government to take active involvement into the investigation of the attacks, the MEA spokesperson said that if Islamabad wishes to investigate cross border attacks, India is ready to provide fingerprints and DNA samples of those terrorists killed in the Uri and Poonch incidents."

The actor met Raj Thackeray on Sunday to promise Pakistani actor Mahira Khan will not visit India during his film’s promotions.
Shah Rukh Khan doesn’t want any trouble before his next release, Raees. Ever since co-producer Ritesh Sidhwani stated that there is no governmental restriction on Pakistani actors from coming to India and if need be Mahira Khan would be brought here for promotions, a statement to which SRK agreed at the trailer launch, speculations were rife that it could lead to another massive protest.

To nip any such issue from cropping up and also to clarify his stance on Mahira and other Pakistani actors, SRK met MNS supremo Raj Thackeray at his residence this evening. In a meeting that lasted for almost an hour, SRK promised Raj that neither will he bring down Mahira to India for promoting Raees and nor will he work with any Pakistani actors in future.


Confirming the same to indianexpress.com, Amey Khopkar of MNS said, “There was news in the media for past one week that SRK is going to get Mahira Khan to India for film promotions. So he came here to meet Raj saheb to tell that Mahira Khan is not coming to India for any kind of film promotion and he will also not cast any Pakistani artistes in future.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Amey also clarified that there would be no protests from MNS as far as Raees is concerned. “In the meeting between Raj Saheb and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Producers’ Guild that took place in October, it was decided all the films that have already been shot and has Pakistani actors in it will be allowed to release and going forward no Indian producer, director or actor will work with Pakistani artistes. SRK too agreed to the same in his meeting with Raj Saheb.”
After September 18 Uri attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead and the September 28 surgical strikes by India on Pakistan terror camps, the MNS had strongly protested against hiring of Pakistani actors by Indian filmmakers. Thackeray had vowed to stop the release of a few films in which Pakistani actors are playing roles, including Karan Johar’s recent Ae Dil Hai Mushkil featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and SRK’s Raees which has cast Mahira Khan.
MNS had staged dramatic protests prior to the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil but finally relented after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis brokered peace with MNS, Johar and the Film & Television Producers Guild of India. This paved the way for the film’s peaceful release and exhibition across Maharashtra on October 28.
In 2013, SRK’s Chennai Express had run into trouble with the MNS for yanking off Marathi films to accommodate its shows in single-screen cinemas. Prior to that, SRK’s blockbuster My Name Is Khan had run into trouble with the Shiv Sena but the issue was later amicably sorted out.
Looks like Raees is now set to have a hassle free release after Raj Thackeray green lighting it."

In what ways is the Indian incursion a watershed event in India-Pakistan engagement?
First, Tuesday’s airstrikes by the Indian Air Force establishes a new threshold between the two nuclear neighbours for an Indian response to a terror attack. So far, India has either chosen to put diplomatic pressure on Pakistan (after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack), mobilise its armed forces (after the 2001 Parliament attack) or conducted limited ground-based operations (after the 2016 Uri attack) but has never used the Air Force, that too inside Pakistan.

The use of airpower has been taboo between the two countries, especially after both became declared nuclear powers in 1998, because of the dangers of escalation. While Pakistan has threatened retaliatory action, the fact remains that a major red-line about use of airpower has been crossed by India now. Restrictions around the use of airpower are best illustrated by the Kargil War, when the Vajpayee government allowed the IAF to be used, but did not allow it to cross the LoC. As much as it was about respecting the LoC and highlighting Pakistani incursions, it was also about the escalatory dangers of using airpower.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A more important reason making it a watershed is the extent of incursion. Indian operations after the 1971 War have always been limited to the Line of Control and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, never venturing into mainland Pakistan. As India considers PoK to be Indian territory illegally occupied by Pakistan, and LoC is a militarily active border manned by the two armies, military action there has been considered somewhat acceptable.

This airstrike also sets a precedent for future action by India: use of airpower in mainland Pakistan against terror camps. If it is Balakot today, it could be Bahawalpur or Muridke tomorrow. This new template for Indian response is going to create a public clamour in India after every terror incident to punish Pakistan, another reason that makes it a real watershed in the history of the bilateral relationship.

The Foreign Secretary has called it an “intelligence-led operation” and a “non-military preemptive action”. What do these expressions mean?
The Foreign Secretary was taking the care of asserting that the targets had been carefully selected, based on hard intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the camp. This intelligence would be from technical inputs (via satellites), or communication intercepts or human intelligence sources on the ground. By calling it an intelligence-led operation, the government was trying to send a message to the global audience that the airstrikes were not done at some arbitrarily chosen place but were part of a well-considered action.
The phrasing of “non-military preemptive action” was important for two reasons. Given that use of airpower inside Pakistani mainland territory is bound to be considered an act of war, India by calling it non-military wanted to reassure everyone that it is not such an act. That India chose not to target the Pakistan military or civilians but a terror camp was an important part of the Indian argument for preventing any escalation by the Pakistani side.

The words “preemptive action” were to suggest that the airstrike was not an act of revenge or retribution but an act of self-defence to prevent a likely terror attack in the future. All these phrases point to an effort to couch the action in terms that have a de-escalatory tone, giving Pakistan the space it may need to de-escalate.
Pakistan has called India’s action “grave aggression” and warned of an “appropriate reply”. What form could that take?
Any step that Pakistan takes from here on as an “appropriate reply” would be escalatory in nature, which could beget a further response from India. While Pakistan will try and make a diplomatic case against India, it is unlikely to carry any weight because of its track record in dealing with terrorist groups. Any military action outside the LoC will be an act of war, and hitting any non-military target is fraught and could make the situation even more difficult for Pakistan.
Having wrested the initiative, India would have placed its armed forces on the highest alert, which takes away any element of surprise that Pakistan would want in conventional warfare. It may intensify its shelling along the border.

Having taken this leap, what are the key challenges for India?
The real challenge is of an escalation matrix. Essentially, this means that the Indian armed forces will now have to be prepared for a full-spectrum of conflict.
Politically, India is heading into elections and the BJP has done well to tone down the rhetoric.

Diplomatically, it is the challenge of dealing with the US, China and Russia, which are interested in a settlement with Pakistan and would advise both the countries to exercise restraint. While that restraint is now being asked of Islamabad, in case of a Pakistani military misadventure against India, that restraint would also be sought of New Delhi.
The surgical strike after the Uri attack did not prevent the Pulwama attack. If there is yet another attack, what could India’s response be?
The purpose of a military action after a terror strike is either compellence or deterrence. While compellence refers to India’s demonstration of military and political will to compel Pakistan to change its ways of patronising terror, deterrence refers to a fear of punishment to stop Pakistan from supporting another terror attack in India. The air strike in Balakot is a strong signal that India can hold the threat of action as a coercive tool and use the diplomatic offensive to demand compliance from Pakistan.

A large number of Indian-Americans held a protest in front of Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the UN and its Consulate, strongly condemning the terror attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama and demanding swift action against Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed and its leader Masood Azhar.
Members of the Indian-American community from the New York and New Jersey area raised slogans against Pakistan and carried placards as they waved the Indian tri-colour during the protest outside the Pakistani Consulate and Permanent Mission premises in Manhattan Friday afternoon.
The agitated protestors also waved the Indian tri-colour and the American flag as they demanded justice for the terror attack, saying the deaths of the 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel will not go in vain.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Jagdish Sewhani, President of The American India Public Affairs Committee and one of the organisers of the event, told PTI that through the protest, the message to Pakistan is that “enough is enough. This time we will not forgive and we will not forget”.
He said the Pulwama terror attacks is the “final nail in the coffin” for the Pakistani terrorists who have repeatedly targeted India over the years, from the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks to the Pathankot and Uri attacks.
He added that the UN Security Council Press Statement condemning the Pulwama attacks has “isolated Pakistan”.
He said the Indian-American community urges Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “discontinue all diplomatic relations with Pakistan and give it a reply in the language it understands”.
The crowd of close to about 200 raised slogans of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, ‘Vande Mataram’, ‘Pakistan Murdabad’, ‘Pakistan-terrorist’ and carried placards that read ‘Handover Masood Azhar-Global Terrorist’, ‘Pakistan Stop Harbouring Terrorists’, ‘Pakistan stop terrorism’, ‘Pakistan – progress the country not terrorism’, and ‘Pakistan Global Exporter of Terrorism’.
Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party-USA President Krishna Reddy Anugula said the Indian community in the US strongly condemns the “dastardly” attacks.
“We are demanding that the perpetrators of the attack should be brought to justice and the terror infrastructure based in Pakistan has to be dismantled,” he said adding that JeM Chief Azhar should be handed over to India to face trial. Reddy slammed the support that the terrorist groups get from the Pakistan Army and its intelligence unit ISI.
Ganesh Ramakrishnan, one of the coordinators of the protest, said the Pakistani Army has been harbouring terrorism.
“It is the global exporter of terrorism and is the incubation of all the start-ups of terrorism.”
He said the international community must raise its voice against terrorism emanating from Pakistan soil and ensure that concrete actions are taken to eliminate the terror factories in Pakistan.
“The international community has to isolate Pakistan. Nations have been making only symbolic gestures but it is high time that concrete action is taken as terrorism impacts not just one nation but the entire world.”
The organisers also tried to give a memorandum condemning the attack and demanding action to the Pakistani Consulate and Permanent Mission but the gates of the premises remained locked during the protests."

The spectacle of two nuclear-armed nations bickering like schoolchildren is nothing if not comic, and the Twitter fight between US President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un had given the world plenty to snigger about. It is more difficult to laugh when the joke hits closer home. India and Pakistan have never offered a model of good neighbourly relations. Yet their conduct over the last couple of weeks would have been entertaining if it did not give rise to a new sense of despair. Now they are ringing each other’s doorbells in Islamabad and New Delhi in pre-dawn attacks on the nerves of diplomats and shooting smartphone videos of diplomats’ kids.
Harassment of Indian and Pakistani diplomats posted in each other’s countries had become a thing of the past. The last time such complaints came to the fore was in 2006. Usually, the reasons on the surface are petty, such as denial of membership to a club. But they tend to look bigger when relations between the two sides are not in the pink of health. Irrespective of the club membership denied to the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad, and the 3 am ring of the doorbell at the Indian Deputy High Commissioner’s, India should ask itself if retaliation in kind behoves a country with global aspirations.
That this style of doing diplomacy, given up a decade ago, has made a comeback underlines what is most worrying about this saga: Diplomatic relations between the two countries have slid to where they were at the start of this century. The High Commissioner of Pakistan to India has returned for “consultations” to Islamabad, and going by reports in the Pakistani press, is unlikely to return until a resolution. Pakistan will not attend a WTO meeting in New Delhi. All this has overshadowed even the modest gains on the prisoners’ issue earlier this month. The present moment recalls a time when India downgraded its mission in Islamabad, and Pakistan followed suit, in the wake of the 2001 Parliament attack. Expulsions followed and eventually, the two sides had only a shell of a diplomatic presence on the other side until 2004, when relations began to improve following the Vajpayee-Musharraf meeting in Islamabad.
That process broke down in 2008, and the Narendra Modi government has entirely given up attempts to revive it, citing the Pathankot and Uri attacks. It is unfortunate, even alarming, that in both countries, those in charge of the foreign policy and security establishments are sanguine that the deteriorating situation — most evident in the breakdown of the ceasefire at the LoC, where five more civilians were killed in Balakote sector of Poonch on Sunday in firing from Pakistan — does not demand a renewed push, of the kind Musharraf and Vajpayee gave it, to restart engagement. Indeed, on the Indian side, Pakistan’s “recall” of its High Commissioner is possibly being seen as a pressure tactic on India for talks which should be resisted. Two mavericks have decided that it’s time to change history in East Asia. Time to ask why not in South Asia."

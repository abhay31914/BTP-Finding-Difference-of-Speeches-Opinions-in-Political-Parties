Farmhouses, party plots, hotels and resorts in Panch-mahals, Kevadia in Narmada district (near the Statue of Unity), Sanand, Dholka, Ognaj and Viramgam in Ahmedabad rural, Kalol in Gandhinagar and areas in Surat district recorded full bookings for the New Year weekend.
However, celebrations will be muzzled with no mass gatherings, DJ or orchestra performances as police have warned of legal action against both the hosts and party goers if social distancing norms are violated.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Night curfew from 9 pm to 6 am is in place in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara, while it will be relaxed by an hour and will begin at 10 pm from January 1. Police have banned entry to these cities after 9 pm on December 31. However, with no such restriction in the rural areas of these cities as well as other surrounding districts, party goers have found a new haven.
In Narmada, the Statue of Unity (SoU) management has increased the number of available tickets from 2,500 to 5,500 for the viewing gallery.
In Panchmahals, popular tourist destinations such as Jambughoda, which are home to several private resorts are seeing packed premises with individual bookings. A senior police officer of the district said that the drive to crack down on any New Year bash is ongoing but private bookings in hotels and resorts would not classify under violation of Covid-19 norms.
“If a small group of friends or a family has checked into a hotel or resort following Covid-19 guid-elines, it wouldn’t really be in violation. We are watching private parties closely and will crack down on any violation,” the officer said.
The Vadodara police has issued a public message to make people aware that no police permission has been granted to any organisers for New Year bash and, therefore, the onus is on the citizens to stay away from such events.
A senior officer of the city police said, “Whenever there is a violation of the prohibitory orders, revellers who have participated with full awareness blame the organisers to escape the law. Therefore, we have made it clear with the notification that the onus will be on the participants as much as on the organisers…”
In Ahmedabad rural, police have instructed owners of 8-9 resorts and over 150 farm houses to not hold any celebratory event on December 31 night.
Virendra Yadav, Superintendent of Police, Ahmedabad rural, said, “We will have strict bandobast in place with 24 check points in Ahmedabad rural where we will take action against those violating Covid norms… Farm houses and resort owners have been told to not organise any late night event… their actions will be monitored by police constantly… Action will be taken against both resort management and guests if instances of late night partying is found…”
A staff associated with Gulmohar Greens Resort on Sarkhej-Sanand Highway in Sanand of Ahmedabad rural, said, “At present, we have 30-35 rooms occupied with guests… We have told our guests that no late night celebration or partying will be allowed at our resort.”
Surat city and district police who are on vigil will use drone cameras to monitor activities inside farmhouses. There are over 150 farmhouses in the city and over 250 of them in the district.
Surat city police commissioner Ajay Kumar Tomar said, “We will ensure strict implementation of Covid- 19 guidelines and also the curfew in city areas. Farm houses and party plots are being screened by our personnel.”
Surat district Superintendent of Police Usha Rada said, “There are several farmhouses here and we have intimated local police to step up vigil… we are against liquor parties. On national highways, our teams will strictly check drink-and-drive cases.”
Meanwhile, police will be not use breathalysers to check if commuters are under the influence of alochol due to Covid-19 restrictions. As per senior police officers, patrolling and check post teamswere asked to monitor the speech and movement of the suspects and take blood samples for tests if need be.

Vadodara police, which has been using breathalysers in an ongoing drive against drunk driving, has attracted attention during the pandemic, especially since the state police has prohibited its use. Vadodara Commissioner of Police RB Brahmabhatt said that the department has discontinued the use of breathalysers from Thursday.
In Valsad, close to Union Territory of Daman and Silvassa where there is no prohibition on liquor sale, police have already started a drive against drink-driving. District Superintendent of police Dr Rajdeepsinh Zala said, “We have taken eight private halls on rent, and four tents have been made on open party plots to keep those arrested in the night in prohibition cases.”"

Even as the Maharashtra government has applied to get environmental clearance (EC) for its Statue of Shivaji (SoS) project, the Gujarat government has defended its stand of not applying for the same for its Statue of Unity (SoU) project that is coming up on an islet near Kevadia in Narmada district.
The Gujarat government has defended its decision before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the grounds that the Shivaji project coming up in the Arabian sea near Mumbai cannot be compared with the Statue of Unity project.
[related-post]
The Shivaji statue project is proposed to be 190-metre tall. The SoU project, however, is planned to be of 182-metre height and work on it has already started. The superintending engineer of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), Rajendra Kanungo, submitted an affidavit in May, opposing the petition before the Pune bench of NGT.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On comparison between the two projects, the officer stated in the affidavit, “As far as the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the SoS project coming up in Mumbai is concerned, I say that both the projects are completely different and cannot be compared with each other. The geographical location of the project surrounding ecology, flora, fauna, and all other environmental parameters are absolutely different from each other.” A group of environmental activists from central Gujarat have challenged the SoU project before NGT on the ground that Gujarat Government has not got EC for the project from the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF).
The work order for the SoU project, worth Rs 2,979 crore, has already been awarded to Larsen & Toubro and the company has already begun work on the project. The petitioners have challenged the project on a number of grounds and to buttress their arguments they have cited the SoS project of Maharashtra Government for which the latter has already applied for EC from MoEF. The ToR for the EC of SoS project have already been issued by MoEF.
Maharashtra government has submitted the details of SoS project to the MoEF which issued it ToR on February 5, 2015, asking the government to examine every aspect of environment impact and safety measures for environmental impact assessment report. As per the ToR, the project implementing agency will have to study infrastructure facilities at the seashore, their development and related impacts. It has been asked to “examine the carrying capacity vis-a-vis safe limit of number of people to be permitted on the island at a time, keeping in view emergency evacuation in unforeseen situation like terrorist operation, cyclone and other natural phenomenon.”
The ToR also suggests the government to seek advice from Bombay Natural History Society on impact the project might have on birds and marine life. It requires to examine details of stone requirement, land use according to master plan and land use till around 10 kilometer radius of the project site. The ToR also asks the government to prepare environmental monitoring and management plans for the project and submit details of Risk Assessment and Disaster Management Plan after getting clearance from the Mumbai Port Trust and the Indian Navy.
The petitioners have annexed a copy of the ToR for SoS project’s EC before the NGT. They have claimed that like SoS, SoU project is also coming up in environmentally sensitive area and so EC is must for the same. They have added that while the SoU project is coming up on a water body near a huge dam that falls in earthquake-prone zone, it is also near Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary.
While not seeking EC for SoU project, SSNNL — the project implementing agency of the Guajrat government — has maintained that since the total built-up area of the first phase of the project will be 19,731 square metre, it does not require prior environmental clearance as per the EIA Notification, 2006, which states that only building and construction project with a built-up area more than 20,000 square metre will require such clearance.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
SSNNL stated that it had consulted state-level Environmental Clearance Assessment Authority in 2010 which stated that no environ mental clearance was required. The case is due to be heard in the NGT on Wednesday."

Kevadiya, a small town with a population of 6,788 people and just 3.5 km from the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, is all set to get its own railway station, sources involved in the planning told PTI.
President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are slated to lay the foundation stone for the same on December 15, they said.

“During the first 11 days of its opening, the monument has already been visited by around 1.3 lakh tourists. This is great news for tourism in the state. However, this area is plagued by connectivity issues and we needed to address that. This will be a modern railway station and will see huge footfall. Other than a boost in tourism, the project will lead to development in the area, create employment among other things,” a source said.
Currently, there is no direct air or train connectivity to Kevadiya. The nearest stations to Kevadiya are Vadodara (71.94 km), Bharuch (75.36 km) and Ankleshwar (77.95 km). A smaller station, Miyagam Karjan is 63.02 km from the town.
By air, one has to take a flight to Surat. Kevadiya is 83 km from Surat. From the Ahmedabad airport, the Statue of Unity is almost 200 km away.
Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Governor Om Prakash Kohli will also be present at the foundation stone laying function, the source added.
The statue is being touted as the latest in Gujarat’s list of tourist attractions and the government is keen to ensure that no stone is left unturned to ensure a regular tourist inflow, the sources said.
In fact, the Gujarat government has written to the chief ministers of all states to consider setting up guest houses near the Statue of Unity and a few states have already shown interest, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Gujarat’s minister for Education, Law, Justice and Civil Aviation said in Kolkata on Tuesday.
The Gujarat government built the 180-feet statue of Sardar Patel at a cost of around Rs 3,000 crore.
On an average, 15,000 visitors visit the statue every day, according to the state government.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had unveiled the statue on October 31."

The Pune-based western zone bench of the tribunal dismissed the petition, filed by environmental activists in Vadodara, on the ground of “limitation”, leaving it open for the petitioners to approach another competent court. The bench of Justice Vikas R Kingaonkar and expert member Ajay Deshpande said the petitioners approached it in March 2015, six months after the Gujarat government handed over the work order to L&T.
According to Rohit Prajapati, one of the petitioners in the case, “The tribunal said that although the case has merit, we should have approached the tribunal within six months after the foundation stone for the project was laid in October 2013. Our argument was that the clarity on the project was available only once the work order was given out, for us to ascertain environmental violations. We urged the tribunal to not set a precedent for environmental violations in such projects. The tribunal has left open the option for us to appeal in other competent courts and we will do so in due course.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The construction of the 180-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the island in the middle of Narmada river started in November 2014.
The petitioners had apprehended that the project would have a long-term effect on the Narmada basin and it would burden the tectonic faultline in the river. They claimed that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), a special-purpose vehicle established by the Gujarat government, had not taken any environmental clearance.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
SVPRET, however, maintained that the project needs no green nod as the “statue” will be spread over only 12,000 square feet and environmental nod is required for a project of over 20,000 sq feet. “As per the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, there’s a time limitation of six months, including the grace period from the day the action of such dispute first arose. Although my clients had issued notices to Gujarat Government, the Pollution Control Board, the Environment Department, we approached as early as November 2013, we filed the case with NGT only in January 2015. Without going into the merit of our argument, the bench dismissed the application observing that it was not filed within the period of six months even though the petitions — as displayed by the notices served in November 2013 — were well aware of the action which, according to them, violates the law,” said Asim Sarode, advocate of the petitioners. He said that the clients will study the verdict and will then decide if they would opt to go for an appeal."

(Source: Twitter/@narendramodi)
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is conducting its two-day executive meeting in New Delhi ahead of the crucial assembly election in several states and the upcoming 2019 general elections. The executive meeting has seen a host of statements from the top leadership of the party, talking about the achievements of the Modi government, attacking the opposition and pitching the idea of ‘New India’.
Here are top quotes from BJP Executive Meeting
Narendra Modi, Prime Minister
Addressing the executive meet on the second day, PM Modi said, “For 31 years we are in power in Gujarat. we have been able to do that because we are not greedy for power. We don’t seek power as an instrument of sitting on the chair, rather we seek power to work for the people.” Taking to Twitter, Modi added, “Our Party is humbled by the strong support across India. In the spirit of ‘Ajay Bharat, Atal Bhajpa’ we will continue working tirelessly for India’s growth.”



Meanwhile, attacking the opposition parties, Modi said, “The Opposition doesn’t fight over work and issues, they fight on lies. We’ll counter their falsehood, misrepresentation through the great work we have done in 4 years,”. He further said that if the Opposition will ask questions based on the current government’s work, then they will know the difference between the work done by a family which ruled the country for 48 years and a party which has been in power for only 48 months.
Amit Shah, BJP president
“While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making India, the Congress is breaking India. Congress identifies itself with those who are keen to break up India,” Shah said in the closed-door meeting with top executives of the party. He added, “The fragrance of governance is spreading everywhere. In addition, we have the charisma of our leadership (Narendra Modi). This will help us in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Addressing the media, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman quoted the party president as saying that the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) is a dhakosla (eye-wash), bhranti (mirage) and based on falsehood. He reminded cadres that the party had, in 2014, won against each of the parties that were now attempting to form the grand alliance and therefore, they should expose the falsehood of this coalition. “People are standing with grit and determination to support the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and the BJP. Our continued commitment and resolve for development will defeat the opposition’s attempts at spreading rumours and propaganda,” Shah told the BJP leadership.
Vijay Rupani, Gujarat CM

Vijay Rupani Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the respect to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel which Congress failed to give. Speaking on the sidelines of the BJP National Executive meet, Rupani said that Congress always placed Sardar Patel behind Jawaharlal Nehru and therefore he never received the recognition he deserved on the world stage.
“When PM Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he had announced to make the statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel which is now going to be completed. On October 31, the world’s biggest statue, ‘Statue of Unity’, will be unveiled on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel,” Rupani told reporters. The statue has been made with world-class facilities, he said.

Prakash Javadekar, HRD Minister
Addressing the media on the second day of the meet, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “The prime minister had promised a new India and after four years the country has progressed. New India will be successful, free from poverty, terrorism, corruption by 2022.” On terrorism, Javadekar, “Terrorist activities has decreased under the Narendra-Modi led government. We are focusing on PM’s concept of New India.”

Targetting the opposition, Javadekar said, “The opposition has no agenda or policy, or strategy. They only believe in ‘Modi roko abhiyan (Stop Modi)’. The people of the country know them well. We will win with an even bigger majority in 2019.”
Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Madhya Pradesh CM
Chouhan who is gearing up for the upcoming assembly elections in MP said that the party and state government is working in tune of PM Modi’s vision to double the farm income by 2022. He added that an agriculture resolution was passed during the executive meet. Speaking on the sidelines of the meet, Chouhan said, the Modi government has been successful on every front be it improving irrigation facilities for farmers, interlinking of rivers or providing farmers with the soil health card."

After much deliberation over the quality of the scrap iron gathered from farmers across the country for the Statue of Unity, the Gujarat government has finally put the processed metal in use for the construction of the monument dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who visited the Statue of Unity project on Thursday ahead of Garib Kalyan Mela in Rajpipla, said iron extracted from the scrap has been used “symbolically” in the statue. The iron has been processed from the scrap, which was accumulated through a tool collection drive launched by the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET).

Rupani, who visited the Narmada Dam and the site of the Statue of Unity — slated to be the world’s tallest statue at 182m, expressed satisfaction over the progress of the project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He told reporters, “Work on the Statue of Unity, the dream project of PM Narendra Modi, is going on at a good speed. The statue will provide employment to locals. The work on the installation of the gates of the dam is also going on a faster pace.”
“We have processed the metal and used about 105 metric tonne of iron to create the reinforcement beams for the statue, which is symbolic of the unity, as per the vision of PM Modi to use metal from across India in the statue,” he further said.
Initially, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) officials had toyed with the idea of creating a separate memorial out of the scrap as it was of “inferior” quality, with mostly rusted pieces of scrap. However, K V Sanghavi, Statue of Unity chief engineer, project director & director (canals) for SSNNL, said that during the course of the deliberations, it was decided to use the processed iron. Sanghavi told The Indian Express, “Depending upon the metallurgy, things can be added or subtracted from the scrap during the process of extraction. We were able to extract 105 tonne of metal from 135 metric tonne of scrap that was processed.”
Sanghavi added that the project officials felt “it was better” to use the metal to construct the statue instead of a memorial.
The project would also see officials from TQ Art Foundry belonging to Jiangxi Tongqing Company in Nanchang in Eastern China arriving to assist in the cladding of the metal facade during the last stages of the project by the next year.
According to Sanghavi, the metal cladding of the Sardar Patel statue was being manufactured as small panels and those would be assembled through a welding process. “There will be small panels, all cast in China. There, the people will first put it into a wider facade by tech-welding. If it all looks good, it will be sent to India as manageable panels. Here, it will be tech-welded together to form the facade. We will check the geometry at the ground level before finally cladding it to the main statue.”
Sanghavi added that Gurgaon-based sculptor R V Suthar had visited the Chinese casting company to check the texture and the progress of the work.
In his public address later at Garib Kalyan Mela in Rajpipla, where he distributed self-employment kits to several beneficiaries from various talukas of the district, Rupani also announced that the state government had initiated a service to provide hearse to families of poor villagers.
Referring to the incident at Bhawanipatna in Odisha, where a tribal man carried his wife’s body for a distance of 10 km, Rupani said, “After what happened in Odisha, the Gujarat government has decided to make shav vahinis (hearses) available for needy villagers to transport. We will make this facility available in a few days, ahead of Navratri.”"

With days to go for the inauguration of the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Narmada district of Gujarat on October 31, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has invited all states to join hands in unity – as envisaged by Patel – by constructing state bhavans to boost tourism of the site at Kevadia Colony.
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) officials said land has been finalised about 4 km from the statue for states to construct guesthouses and canteens – on the lines of different state bhavans in New Delhi.
Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh said letters from the Chief Minister were sent to all states last week, and Uttar Pradesh and Nagaland have already accepted the proposal and confirmed intention to construct guesthouses in Kevadia Colony. “Other states are considering the proposal,” he told The Indian Express.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On Thursday, the engineering teams completed construction of the Statue of Unity’s head and put up the bronze facade of the face, thus finishing the exterior work. Work on its interior is going on.
A tent city has been set up in Kevadia, about 90 km southwest of Vadodara, which will be a permanent feature for tourists. Sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the tent city on October 31, Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary.
This year’s annual conference of directors-general of police (DGPs) is also slated to be held in Kevadia in the presence of National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.

In 2016, Prime Minister Modi had hosted the DGP conference at White Rann, in Gujarat’s Kutch district, during Rannotsav, the annual desert festival in the Little Rann of Kutch.
Chief Secretary Singh said, “There are grand plans for the inauguration of the Statue of Unity as well as for tourism in Kevadia. The Chief Minister has invited other states to have their presence in the vicinity of the statue to symbolise the unity that Sardar Patel stood for.”
He said the Prime Minister is likely to make an announcement about this during the statue’s inauguration.

An SSNNL official said, “The idea is to increase tourism (to Kevadia) and encourage people to visit the world’s tallest statue. The presence of state bhavans will motivate budget travelers to visit Narmada. The state canteens are very popular in Delhi for regional cuisines but many of them do not serve outsiders. The presence of these bhavans in Kevadia will be an added attraction for food-lovers.”
Besides guesthouses, states will also have space to display handicraft from their regions, officials said. Singh said the idea is to not have any boundary walls between the premises of different state bhavans.
“They will be united, in one compound. We are prepared to welcome about 25 states. They can have about 15 rooms each. We can also construct one structure with portions allotted to different states on the lines of Shrestha Bharat Bhavan (near the statue), depending on how many states express interest,” Singh said.
An SSNNL official said building the last 50 metres of the statue was most challenging. “There are no concrete cores above the level of 157 metres. Given wind velocity in the region, the construction of the statue, which is heavy at the top and slender at base, is an engineering marvel,” the official said."

(Express Photo/File)
One of the four giraffes and two impalas died at the upcoming Sardar Patel Zoological Park in Kevadia Colony near the Statue of Unity, generating much concern around the health of the exotic and rare animals being imported from different countries, Gujarat government officials say that some mortality was expected as a natural process of displacement of animals.
About 80 specimens of over 15 species of animals arrived in Kevadia in October and most of them continue to be in quarantine as per the mandatory process laid down by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).
The park was scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, but it is yet to open.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Tuesday, the death of a giraffe and two impalas in the park were reported, with the Director of the park Dr Ram Ratan Nala terming it peracute mortality syndrome, which affects giraffes even as the autopsy report of the animals is awaited.
Sources told this newspaper that the contract for shipping and customs clearances of animals was handed to a Hyderabad-based company, Seaways Shipping, which holds expertise in the area. The company, an official added, had recommended chartering Boeing 777 aircraft for two batches of animals that arrived in Kevadia in two batches in October. A first batch of 30 animals consisting of rare species like Wallabies (found primarily in Australia), Llamas and Alpacas (found mostly in South America) were transported from Netherlands to Hyderabad and onward to Kevadia mid-October while over 43 exotic animals, including giraffes, zebras, blue wildebeest, gemsbok, oryx and impalas were transported from Johannesburg (South Africa) to Ahmedabad on a chartered flight on October 28.
However, according to Rajeev Kumar Gupta, Managing Director, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd., and also Additional Chief Secretary (Forests & Environment), the deaths are not a sign of inability to adapt. “It was of course 100 per cent expected to have some mortality. It happens even when animals are transported from one zoo to another within the country. Even if trees are uprooted from one place and planted elsewhere, some do not survive. All animals that were imported were in good health and all necessary vaccinations and health protocols were followed. The due process of quarantine were also followed.”
Gupta said that the giraffe that died on Tuesday was one among the four imported from Africa. Gupta said, “We got four giraffes. One giraffe had hurt its foot a few days ago and was undergoing treatment. It is possible that it could not cope with the stress. The two impalas, however, died after they fell from a height while running around.”
Gupta also said that the authorities were exercising more caution although the mortalities are not serious in nature. “Given the fact that some animals have died, we have now decided to separate them from the lot and give them time in their own open spaces to be comfortable and adapt to the surroundings. We have also called in experts from Anand veterinary college as well as from Gandhinagar to look into the health and well-being of all animals,” he said.
Officials said that process laid down by the CZA was duly followed in the case of each import. According to an employee of Seaways shipping, the transport logistics company that delivered the animals to the Gujarat authorities, the entire process was carefully planned. “Preparation of the extensive documentation and briefing the customs officials went according to plan. There were some challenges as well… Long distance journeys can be stressing for animals, especially since the enclosures are meant to be small to prevent injuries while to movement in transit.”
The handler also shared that as per the CZA rules, the animals were brought in wooden enclosures with enough ventilation and hessain pads for bedding. The CZA guidelines for captive animals state, “It is important that all transportation containers should have inner surfaces which are completely free of any projecting nails, screws, ends of mesh or any other sharp material, which could cause injury to the animal… Moreover, if any wood preservative or paint is used on the container, it should not be toxic or a skin irritant… The transportation container should have adequate air circulation at all times…”
According to the shipping company executive, the animals were accompanied by a team of assistants and a veterinarian all through the journey. “The guidelines prohibit transport via road for distances over 1000 kilometres preferring railways instead but since these species were rare and quarantine was an important issue, they were flown to Ahmedabad by air. Most of the animals are sub-adults of the age 4 to 6 years,” the official said.
According to CZA guidelines, the procedure and process for acquiring animals from zoos abroad recommends acquiring more than two specimens of a species. “While negotiating with the foreign zoo, try to acquire at least two pairs or more number of specimens you propose to add to your collection plan. This will ensure that even if one animal dies during transit, you are left with at least three or more specimens,” it states."

Analytics as a tool
A bunch of engineers and statisticians analyses data of the past six elections, fuses it with demographic, socio-economic and their own opinion poll data, and slices it to the level of polling booths across 400 constituencies. This is analytics, a tool employed by hardcore market research and digital companies, and the Modi team says it helped them get a nuanced picture of patterns, issues and voters’ inclinations. The analytics team is in constant touch with other teams, using their real-time inputs, blending them with its own data and updating all teams on any changes in public mood, trends and issues. The analytics team even decides the routes to be taken by the Modi cavalcade, besides keeping an account of vehicles and drivers. “At any point in time, we have exact information on which vehicle is placed where and who is driving,” says a member of the team.
The big brains
The Citizens for Accountable Governance is a think-tank spearheading Modi’s marketing and communication push. It’s a central research team of policy analysts, economists, foreign policy experts and graduates from leading institutions across the world. The team has prepared reports on national policies and social and economic issues that have been discussed this election. It provides constant inputs for Modi’s speeches, social media conversations and chai pe charcha.
Mind readinghttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On-ground surveys and interviews spot electoral patterns and preferences — in short, internal opinion and exit polls. The information gathered is passed on to the analytics team that fuses it with its own data and other inputs from the research team. The team then analyses the data for trends and aberrations. This effort results in a Rapid Action Report, which presents a constantly evolving picture of a constituency. These inputs are passed on to Modi’s team and they use it to fine-tune his campaign.
Fanning out
Beyond TV commercials, print ads and radio jingles, the strategists conduct several events and programmes across the country, especially in rural areas, to build a direct connect with people.
The mainstream: A team of professionals operating out of New Delhi supervises commercial messages released to the mainstream media, besides buying space and time on various media platforms. Recently, it released a 75-second (the norm is 10 seconds) TV film during nine shows on Star Plus. Called ‘Roadblock’ in ad lingo, it was the only ad aired on those shows, blocking all other commercials. “It was an excellent way of capturing consumer mindspace without getting lost in the cacophony of commercial messages of various brands,” said a Star Plus insider. Besides, Modi’s messages play during popular TV shows on youth channels such as Channel[V].
The IT factor: A dedicated IT cell at the party level and Modi’s own team use Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube to spot friendly voices, reach out, train them and make them stakeholders of Brand Modi. Twenty lakh volunteers work to keep the Modi buzz alive online. Many are young and mid-career professionals from financial services, marketing, media and IT who have quit, taken sabbaticals or are simply devoting a few hours every day to the cause. ‘Modi4PM’, ‘NaMo4PM’, ‘NaMoChaiParty’, ‘Pledge4Modi’ are some of the campaigns they run.
On the ground: Several exercises help reach out to voters, such as chai pe charcha; the ‘Statue for Unity’ project; Sankalp, an initiative to address gender disparity; Manthan, an online and on-ground event with students asked to present “innovative solutions” to 14 “critical challenges the country faces”; Samvad, where volunteers interact with farmers; and Ivote, an initiative urging people to vote. The team running the project is also filing RTIs and organising online petitions to keep the buzz going."

Accenture has been granted a tender of Rs 3 crore which was floated by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), the state government agency executing the project. Official sources said that Accenture was the only bidder for the tender which submitted a bid of Rs 2.5 crore. Accenture has also paid the security deposit of 10 per cent of its bid to the SSNNL.
The state government has already granted the tender for the construction and maintenance of the statue to engineering giant Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T). The government had floated a tender of Rs 2,063 crore for the project against which L&T emerged as the lowest bidder which offered its services at the cost of Rs 2,980 crore. Interestingly, to build and maintain the statue, the government had only two bids. The other bidder was a consortium of three companies led by JMC Projects India that had submitted bid of Rs 4,100 crore. Government sources said that L&T will be issued a Letter of Intent to build and maintain the statue shortly following which the company would carry out exercise for designing the project in the next 3-4 months and then construction work will begin.
The state government requires funds presently estimated to be more than Rs 2,063 crore for the project. Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, who heads the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), the special body to execute the project, has demanded status of a national monument for the project.

In a veiled attack on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that he has no problem if his opponents keep abusing him, but they should not belittle personalities like Sardar Patel. Modi’s remarks come as a continuation of his Saturday’s statement, where he had lashed out at Congress president Rahul Gandhi over his remark that the Sardar Patel’s ‘Statue of Unity’, set to be inaugurated in Gujarat on October 31, is ‘Made in China’.
Modi was in Gujarat to inaugurate a host of development projects in Anand, Khatraj and Anjar, and a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Rajkot. The Prime Minister inaugurated several projects of Amul in Anand, including a Rs 533 crore premium-chocolate plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes per month.
Speaking at the Amul event in Anand, Modi remembered Patel for his contribution to the development of a cooperative model in India. “Sardar saheb sowed the seed for a third economic model — controlled neither by government nor capitalists. Instead, it was created with the cooperation of farmers and people and everybody was a part of it. This is one viable alternative to socialism and capitalism,” Modi said. Patel was also the founder of the Amul dairy cooperative movement in Gujarat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also inaugurated a nutritional food plant, a Rs 8 crore centre of excellence in food processing of the Anand Agriculture University and a Rs 20 crore ice cream plant of the Vidya Dairy.
Modi’s caravan then headed to Anjar in Kutch district, where he addressed a gathering after inaugurating the Mundra LNG Terminal, Anjar-Mundra and the Palanpur-Pali-Barmer gas transmission projects, cumulatively worth Rs 6,216 crore. He said that the power supply from Kutch will give a fillip to Rajasthan and Punjab to move towards a gas-based economy.
Highlighting the achievements of his government in taking the central policies to the people. He said, “In 60 years, 13 crore families received gas connections in the country. In four years we have given connections to 10 crore families,
Modi then headed to Rajkot to inaugurate the Gandhi Museum at Alfred High School, Gandhi’s alma mater. Speaking at the event, Modi said that it was Gandhi, not he, who deserved the UN’s ‘Champions of the Earth’ award. Modi was conferred with the award jointly with French President Emmanuel Macron for their pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance and promoting new areas of cooperation on environmental action.
“Cleanliness was an important aspect of Gandhi’s life and he used to say, if he had to choose between cleanliness and freedom, he would choose cleanliness first, such was his commitment towards cleanliness,” he told PTI.
The Prime Minister also asserted that sanitation coverage in the country has increased to 95 per cent which stood at 35 per cent in 2014."

(Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)
A team of engineers is conducting a geological survey of the site of the Statue of Unity in Sadhu Bet in Narmada to kick start the first phase of construction of the proposed 182-meters tall statue – a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After a detailed report of the geological survey, the work on laying the foundation for the monument will commence.
A team of engineers of the consortium of Turner Construction, Michael Graves and Associates and the Meinhardt Group are supervising the ongoing geological soil survey that began a few days ago. As part of the process, the team of engineers is ascertaining the nature of the strata of the soil where the raft foundation of the statue will be constructed. An engineer of the consortium at the site said that the quartzite hillock will see a foundation of about 52 meters for which the geological tests are being carried out.
[related-post]
“The current machines have been fixed at the site to ensure that the founding level of the surface has no anomalies that can be hazardous for the structure. The rock is very solid and the foundation will be as deep as 52 metres once the construction begins but it is important to check if there are any other aspects that must be considered as the preliminary tests were not able to go into the depths of the rock,” the engineer said. The consortium will hand over a final report of the analysis to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) in due course.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to the data available with the SVPRET, for the raft foundation for the monument, the recommended safe bearing capacity is 2,300 KPa. The site has already been termed safe from seismic hazards. SSNNL engineers say there will be no blasting activity at the site during construction. Instead, advanced slicing technology will be used to shape the base so as to prevent any disturbance to the base of the hillock due to blasting.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The geological survey comes after a team of engineers from L&T Chennai conducted a thorough advanced Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) survey — a remote sensin method using light as pulsed laser to measure elevations accurately, including 3D data regarding the shape and surface of the earth. Engineers say that soon advanced cameras will be installed at the site to enable higher level of engineering teams track the progress at the site via satellite images.

On his first visit to Gujarat after being appointed as Bhartiya Janta Party’s (BJP) national working president, J P Nadda said Gujarat has been a role model for the country. He arrived in Ahmedabad for his two-day visit Friday evening, and held a meeting with the party’s senior members under its membership drive, Sangathan Parv, at the party headquarters, Kamalam.
Addressing party members, including MLAs, MPs, various district incharges and BJP membership drive incharges, in the presence of BJP Gujarat incharge Bhupendra Yadav, BJP national general secretary V Satish, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani and other senior members, in Gandhinagar, he said that all are fortunate to be a part of the world’s largest party.
“We all are very fortunate that we are a part of the largest political party. Since the Jan Sangh times, lakhs of workers have worked hard day and night, the fruits of which we are seeing today. Forty years ago, despite losing elections continuously, we did not lose hope. Though the BJP is ruling many states, Home Minister Amit Shah says that we still need to take it to the top,” Nadda said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that the entire country has been looking at Gujarat. “Gujarat has been a role model for India. After a huge win in 2014, the state model was replicated in the country,” he said.
Talking about the achievements of the party, Nadda said that the BJP government in the Centre has not only raised the living standards of people, but has also improved their health conditions, which is noticed at the international level. “The number of beneficiaries of the Ayushmaan Bharat scheme is higher than even the population of many countries,” he said.
“Taking forward BJP’s Antodaya ideology, the party has always been concerned about the poor, the underprivileged and the backward. Today, both the Centre and the state BJP governments are dedicated to make policies that would reach the public at large,” he added.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are concerned about the prosperity of every citizen and working hard towards making a different image of India for the world. This is the reason that the country’s, especially Gujarat’s BJP workers’ responsibility has increased manifold,” he further added, saying that research would be conducted on changing the country’s image and people’s utmost faith in the BJP.
“I thank the Gujarat BJP team that has arranged meetings with maximum party members during the short visit,” he concluded. Nadda is scheduled to visit the Statue of Unity on Saturday.
Former Congress MLAs Alpesh Thakor and Dhavalsinh Zala, who joined BJP in the presence of Jitu Vaghani on Thursday, were not present at the Sangathan Parv meeting. Party insiders claimed that they did not meet the criteria of the members who were present at the meeting, who were either district or city incharges, board or Corporation chairmen, MLAs, MPs or the meeting organisers."

Dear Reader,
The Big Story
Do kilometre ki doori: That’s the mantra both the Indian and Chinese sides appear to be following while ordering their troops to step back from friction points. On Wednesday, keeping pace with the slow process of disengagement on the Line of Actual Control, both sides moved back by around 2 km from the standoff site at PP15 in the Hot Springs sector. The Indian Express has learnt that the disengagement process is built on a four-pronged disengagement approach that includes keeping adequate troops in depth areas until it is completed.
From Front Page
Pakistan claims that former Indian Navy official Kulbushan Jadhav, who was convicted on charges of spying and terrorist activities in Pakistan, has refused to appeal against his death sentence. India aptly responded to the claim, saying it is “continuation of the farce” in play for the last four years.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A fortnight after coming under the BJP radar, the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and two other trusts linked to the Nehru-Gandhi family will be probed by the Centre in connection with alleged violation of various Acts including money laundering. The Congress termed the government’s move as “cowardly” and a “blind witch-hunt”. “
Three members of a family, all linked to the BJP, were killed in a militant attack on Wednesday evening in North Kashmir’s Bandipore, leading to the arrest of their entire security detail. The high-profile killings in a fortified zone came as a shock for the security establishment, especially as Bandipore has been relatively calm in recent years.

The Pandemic
From cylinders to concentrators, the demand for medical oxygen has shot up ever since it emerged as a key element in the treatment of Covid. Such is demand that many dealers of concentrators, most of which are imported from China, say they are out of stock. Going against expert advice that oxygen must be only used under medical supervision, even residential societies are snapping up oxygen cylinders.  
The Covid-19 transmission rate in India has increased for the first time since March. India’s Covid-19 reproduction number, or R, which estimates the number of people infected by one already infected person, was on a steady decline from 1.83 for months since March 4. However, in the first week of the second unlocking phase in July, the rate has shown an increase for the first time, research by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai shows.
Khagaria district in Bihar, where Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Abhiyan, seems to have had little to offer to migrants who returned. Take Alauli for example. It has 21 panchayats but barely 10 have so far started some works under the ambitious campaign. “These small works with little income cannot hold back workers in Bihar for long,” says Brajesh Kumar.

In Brief
* The surge in polymer content that set off the leak at Visakhapatnam in May and claimed lives  had also happened barely 10 days earlier but no serious note was taken, a probe team has found.
* A coastal village on the outskirts of Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram has emerged as a sensitive Covid-19 hotspot after over 100 people in the area tested positive for the virus in last one week.
* The Centre has “taken a serious note” of the gold smuggling case wherein a senior IAS officer was removed as principal secretary to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
* Ninety-seven per cent of the Congress’ total foreign funds came from the Rural India Supporting Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (both US-based), and the Delhi-based Public Health Foundation of India.
* At a time when the BJP in Chhattisgarh is mocking the Congress-led government’s scheme to purchase cow dung, the RSS has come out in praise of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel for the scheme.
Beyond Covid-19
“Workers like me wonder, even you must be wondering, how to work with Congress leaders we fought against.” Encapsulating the dilemma of party workers who will have to campaign for former Congress leaders in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh bypolls, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that he often sensed their discomfiture at the prospect of seeking votes for their formal rivals. 
A cart puller in Lucknow has been arrested for failing to pay for the damages related to the anti-CAA and NRC protests in December last year. Tehsildar (Sadar) Shambhu Sharan, who is overseeing the recovery process in the city, said: “Mohammad Kaleem will be released after 14 days and we will see what assets he has and will auction them.”
And finally
A pandal, a complimentary banquet hall, e-invites, henna artists, music, all-day meals, including starters and mocktails — and of course, hand sanitisers, social distancing and seating only for 50. The Gujarat government has opened bookings for a “perfect destination wedding” against the backdrop of a picturesque location and open-to-sky setting at the Statue of Unity complex on the Narmada Dam.

Chief Secretary J N Singh Monday visited the site to take stock of ongoing preparations. “We have invited dance troupes from across the country to perform here during the inauguration. Air Force planes and helicopters would shower flowers on the statue during unveiling. I am here today to see how we can synchronise them” Singh told reporters.
In a series of photos, marking the “milestones” of the project, the government said, “When Prime Minister Narendrabhai Modi will dedicate the memorial to the nation on 31st October, 2018, his dream is going to be a reality. The Statue of Unity, for which he had performed the ground-breaking ceremony, is now not only the pride for Gujarat, but also for the nation. It would have not been possible to realise (the dream) without strong determination and political will. A Gujarati has done this”.
Meanwhile, the government announced a change in the PM’s schedule. Earlier, Modi was scheduled to arrive at Kevadia Colony from Delhi on October 31. However, now it has been planned that the PM will arrive in Ahmedabad on the evening of October 30. A top state government officer said that the PM will stay at Raj Bhavan in the night and then to go Kevadia Colony in a chopper, the next day.

Activists Rohit Prajapati,who was among those detained by the police till 2 pm on Thursday until the function at Kevadia Colony completed,said that the police followed them as they entered Devalia in Narmada on Wednesday evening. They were later asked not to go out from a house in Rajpipla.

At midnight,several villagers were detained illegally to create atmosphere of terror inside villages to prevent planned well-announced peaceful hunger strike in villages, he said.
The protesters had made five demands,including supply of water from the Narmada and Karjan dams to the nearby villages for irrigation and drinking purposes,prevention of Kevadia Areas Development Authority (KADA) from acquiring their land,and formation of a new Garudeshwar taluka.
While the government agreed upon most of their demands,it did not commit on whether it will acquire land for tourism,which has not gone down well.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The incident, which was recorded on the CCTV cameras of the safari park entrance shows the five personnel walking into the safari park without tickets.

Saying that they were “opposing just for the sake of opposing”, Modi said “people who oppose and protest are becoming increasingly irrelevant for the country and society”.
Speaking at the inauguration of six projects related to the Namami Gange mission in Uttarakhand, via video conference, Modi said: “They are opposing the independence of the farmer. These people are now insulting farmers by setting on fire the goods and equipment that farmers worship.” Youth Congress workers from Punjab set a tractor on fire near India Gate on Monday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Reiterating that the MSP (minimum support price) system would not be scrapped, Modi said: “The country has freed its farmers from many restrictions. Now, the farmer can sell his produce to anyone, anywhere. But today, when the central government is giving the farmers their rights, these people are protesting.”
“Aaj desh dekh raha hai ki kaise kuchh log sirf virodh ke liye virodh kar rahe hain (The country is watching how some people are opposing just for the sake of opposing),” he said.
“Today, these people are spreading confusion among farmers about MSP. The MSP will remain and the freedom of farmers to sell their produce anywhere will also remain. Some people are unable to accept this freedom. One of their means of generating black money has ended, so they have problems,” he said.
He said the Opposition had also criticised the government on other issues including the jan dhan scheme, GST, one rank-one pension, surgical strikes, Rafale acquisition, Statue of Unity and Ram temple. “Yeh log na kisan ke saath hain, na naujawan ke saath, aur na hee jawan ke saath (these people are neither with the farmer, nor with the youth, nor with the soldiers),” he said.
“It has become their habit to oppose everything that is happening for the country. Their only way in politics is opposition,” he said. “With passage of time, these people who oppose and protest are becoming irrelevant for the country and society… A party, whose four generations of a family ruled the country, wants to fulfill its selfish interests by riding on the shoulders of others, and opposing everything related to national interest,” he said.
Modi also inaugurated the Ganga Avalokan Museum at Haridwar, released a book “Rowing Down the Ganges”, and the new logo for the Jal Jeevan Mission. He unveiled guidelines for village panchayats and water committees under the Jal Jeevan Mission, and announced a 100-day campaign to be launched on October 2 to ensure drinking water connection to every school and anganwadi in the country.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare on Tuesday released its latest data on kharif crop procurement. Up to September 28, paddy procurement was 3,164 metric tonnes in Haryana and 13,256 metric tonnes in Punjab, with a total MSP value of Rs 31 crore at MSP of Rs 1,888 per quintal, from 1,443 farmers."

(Photo: Gajendra Yadav)
Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Radha Soami Satsang centre in South Delhi’s Chattarpur, which is being converted into a Covid facility for 10,000 patients, on Saturday.
Of the 10,000 beds, 2,000 are ready and over 300 personnel provided by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) will be present at the facility initially. This includes doctors, nurses and paramedic staff. No patients have been sent to the facility so far.
During the visit, district and ITBP officials took the two around the facility and explained the process through which patients will be admitted and treated. The facility is spread over around 12,50,000 square feet.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The two also interacted with doctors who have been posted at the facility.
Before the visit, though, Aam Aadmi Party Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and BJP MP Gautam Gambhir sparred on Twitter over the “inauguration” of the centre.
“We hear that the Home Minister Amit Shah is going to the world’s biggest Covid hospital built by the Delhi government to inaugurate it stealthily, quietly (chori-chori, chupke-chupke). Is BJP fighting corona or Arvind Kejriwal,” he tweeted.

Gambhir, who is the MP from East Delhi, replied to Singh and said: “Sanjay ji, I spoke to Home Minister Shri Amit Shah regarding this after your tweet. He said that he wasn’t going to inaugurate the centre but for an inspection, for which Arvind Kejriwal has also been called. Do you not speak to Kejriwal ji or had you decided to take the credit alone?”
The centre at Chattarpur has been build over the past few days by the local administration with help from the Radha Soami Satsang administration, private companies such as Sleepwell that donated beds and mattresses as well as the Centre, which is providing personnel through ITBP and CAPF.
BSES Rajdhani Power Limited had initially provided an electric load of 18,000 KW (18 MW), which was later increased to 23,000 KW (23 MW).
The centre was named the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital after the Home Minister’s visit last week.
On Saturday, Delhi MLA and senior AAP leader Atishi called the centre a “true tribute” to Patel and posted two photos on twitter — one of the centre and the other of the Statue of Unity.
While Kejriwal has thanked the Centre several times over the past two months for their “help and guidance” during the pandemic, other AAP leaders have routinely hit out at the Centre and BJP.
After the visit, Shah tweeted: “I applaud our courageous ITBP personnel, who would be operating this Covid Care facility during these trying times. ..

(IE photo: Vishal Srivastav)
Claiming that the Congress and Samajwadi Party failed in handling the communal riots of Muzaffarnagar, BSP chief Mayawati on Wednesday called for Dalit-Muslim unity to weaken “communal forces”, which were growing stronger in the country. She appealed to Muslims to vote for her party in the coming Lok Sabha elections to keep the BJP away.

In her address at her party’s Savdhan Rally at Ramabai Ambedkar rally ground, she also attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying he should not call Dalits and people from other backward communities “aam aadmi” because they continue to face atrocities across the country.

Addressing the huge gathering on her 58th birthday, the former chief minister said while the Congress-led central government failed to impose President’s rule in the state after the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts to restore harmony, the top SP leadership was busy enjoying a Bollywood dance and song programme at Saifai, the native place of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, instead of helping the victims in relief camps.

Stressing that there is a need to form Dalit-Muslim “bhaichara” (brotherhood), she said the BJP can never form the government if the Muslim community unitedly votes for BSP.

She said if voted to power, her party will “honestly pay special attention” to implement the recommendations of the Sachar Committee.  “Samajwadi Party ki tarah koi dhokha aur anyay nahin hone diya jayega (There will be no betrayal or injustice the way SP has done),” Mayawati alleged.

The BSP has already named 18 Muslim candidates for the Lok Sabha elections. Mayawati said the BSP’s Dalit base has always stood by the Muslims and the latter feel safe with the BSP. “The BSP has a record that no communal riots took place during its government in UP,” she said.

Mayawati reiterated her party will not have any alliance with any party for coming Lok Sabha elections. She said that appointing Muslims as DGP and Chief Secretary, like the SP government has done, will not help the Muslims because “goons and mafia have captured” the state government.

“I did not allow any atrocity to happen on Muslims despite Hindu officers being appointed at these posts,” she said.

Slamming BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi, she said Gujarat CM has announced building of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s “statue of unity” only for political gains. “How can a man who failed to stop the Hindu-Muslim riots after the Godhra incident create unity and bhaichara between the various castes and religions of the country,” she said.

She said while Modi claims to replicate the Gujarat model at the national level, every third child is malnourished in his state and there was no anti-corruption body like Lokayukta there for a long time.  Mayawati alleged that the Congress, BJP and SP came together to defeat the BSP in 2009 Lok Sabha elections to stop a Dalit’s daughter from becoming the PM. She said her party will emerge as “balance of power” in the next Lok Sabha.

Hitting out at AAP, Mayawati said Kejriwal should not count the Dalits and backwards with his own Baniya community and tag them as Aam Aadmi as they face social unequality.

She said SCs are stopped from entering the temples and have to leave their houses to save their lives in Haryana — the home state of Kejriwal.

She said Kejriwal needs to improve the government machinery and not indulge in “natakbazi (drama)” like Janata Durbars."

This month the BJP-led NDA government completes four years in office at the Centre. It is appropriate, then, to look back at the promises made in the BJP’s manifesto and evaluate the government’s performance in the four years. We restrict our analysis to agri-food issues that impact the largest number of people in the country. The problems of the agriculture sector are possibly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed to address the most when he called for “sabka-saath, sabka vikas”.
Modi set expectations of the farming community soaring even before he assumed the prime minister’s office. In October 2013, he asked Indian farmers to donate their used farm-implements to build the Statue of Unity in memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Sardar Patel represented farmers nationally and was behind the setting-up of the first dairy cooperative in Gujarat. Building his statue with metal from used farm-implements was an ingenious idea that helped Modi connect with Indian farmers.
The BJP’s election manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections made several promises to farmers. We discuss two of these promises in this article, the others will be covered in subsequent articles.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The manifesto promised that the BJP, if elected, would ensure that farmers earn at least 50 per cent more than their costs of production. It also promised that a BJP-led government would “radically transform Food Corporation of India (FCI)” by “unbundling FCI operations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency”.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-5159359"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/oped.jpg"" alt="""" width=""622"" height=""333"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/oped.jpg 622w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/oped.jpg?resize=450,241 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/oped.jpg?resize=600,321 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"" />
It took the PM four years to act on the first promise. In this period, profit margins of almost all major crops have fallen. Bonuses given prior to May 2014 on paddy and wheat procurement in states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh were withdrawn. Moreover, increase in MSPs — 3-4 per cent — fell short of covering rising costs of production. Tumbling farm prices in 2016-17 and 2017-18 further squeezed margins. Agitations by farmers, since the past two years, finally shook the government, which then started rethinking the ways to fix minimum support prices (MSPs) at 50 per cent above farmers’ costs. Then started the mystery about the cost-base: Was it supposed to be A2+FL (paid out costs plus imputed family labour) or C2 (comprehensive cost)? A2+FL is about 38 per cent lower than C2. Farmers expected their profit margins to be 50 per cent above C2, but it seems the government may use A2+FL as its base. This has increased the resentment among farmers. Many feel let down. With one year to go for the Lok Sabha elections, it will be crucial for the BJP to rebuild the farming community’s lost trust. Will that is done through loan waivers, interest free loans, or other instruments, will be for all to see.
On the second promise, however, the government moved swiftly. Within three months of assuming office, in August 2014, PM Modi set-up a High-Level Committee (HLC) under the chairmanship of Shanta Kumar, who had served as the Union Minister for Food in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. The committee was mandated to suggest measures to restructure the FCI. This aroused expectations of a radical change in India’s food management system. The HLC submitted its report in January 2015. Inter alia, it recommended four measures: One, rationalise FCI’s procurement operations by moving them away from Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh to Bihar, Odisha and UP; two, reduce the population covered under the National Food Security Act from 67 per cent to 40 per cent, increase the monthly grain-entitlement of beneficiaries and gradually introduce cash transfer in PDS, by first targeting cities with more than 1 million population and then extending it to grain-surplus states, giving the option between cash and grains to others; three, it recommended that FCI’s grain stocking and movement operations be outsourced to the private sector and the corporation’s storages be modernised by bringing in private players; and four, introduce direct cash subsidy to farmers and deregulate the fertiliser sector.
It has been three years since the report was released and barring a few pilot projects that use DBTs with respect to food and fertiliser subsidy, there hasn’t been much change in the FCI’s role and functioning. In fact, the recent announcement of raising MSPs by 50 per cent above A2+FL will further deepen the role of the FCI and NAFED. This will inevitably raise the country’s food subsidy bill and increase the NAFED’s losses because of the pulses and oilseeds purchases it will have to make. The biggest disruption, however, will be the large-scale efficiency losses in agri-markets.
India’s premier food security programme, the public distribution system (PDS), is said to have benefited from the government’s digital drive and its DBT Mission. Aadhaar-linking of ration cards, regular update of beneficiary list and use of Point-of-Sale(POS) machines in ration shops are said to have led to deletion of 2.75 crore bogus ration cards (out of 24.3 crore total ration cards), and reduced grain pilferage. Evidently, this should lead to progressively reduced grain offtakes from the central pool leading to a contained food subsidy bill. However, since 2013-14, PDS grain offtakes have grown from 46.7 MMTs to 54.4 MMTs (2017-18) (Figure). The food subsidy bill has gone up from Rs 92,000 crore (2013-14) to Rs 1,69,000 crore (BE 2018-19) (Figure). But the real devil is in the details. Unpaid FCI food subsidy bills have accumulated over the years, and as of March 31, 2018, they stood at a massive Rs 1.34 lakh crore. Additionally, there are outstanding bills of DCP states for which no reliable estimates are available. After adding all this, the country’s real food subsidy bill amounts to nearly Rs 3 lakh crore.
The conclusion is, alas, that the two promises remain largely unfulfilled. In the last four years, profitability of cultivation fell rather than increased; and FCI paraphernalia expanded and deepened — rather than getting reformed. Further, the Indian farmer feels that she has lost the growth momentum as the average agri-GDP growth rate in the four years of the Modi government (2.4 per cent) is less than half of what was experienced during last four years of Manmohan Singh government (5.2 per cent in 2010-11 to 2013-14).
We hope PM Modi realises gravity of the situation and reverses this trend, and wins back the trust of the Indian farmer."

As the ‘Statue of Unity’ of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is set to be unveiled in Gujarat, there should also be a “statue of disharmony” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh said here Saturday. It was unfortunate that Patel’s statue will be unveiled by those who spread “disharmony and hatred”, said Singh, a Rajya Sabha member, speaking to the media here.
“On October 31, respected Prime Minister Modi is coming to unveil the Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel (at Kevadiya in Narmada district). There should also be a statue of Narendra Modi….called `statue of disharmony’,” he said. “People who are known to spread disharmony and hatred are going to unveil the statue of Sardar Patel. There cannot be anything more unfortunate for the country,” he said. Singh attacked the Modi government for failing to fulfil promises made before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
“People trusted their prime minister that he will bring black money back, but in the last four and a half years, black money has doubled. It was said everybody will get Rs 15 lakh, but later it was termed as `jumla’ (a slogan),” he said. “Youth are still waiting for jobs, and it was for the first time in independent India that farmers had to dump the produce on roads,” Singh said. “He (Modi) had promised to end inflation. But petrol and diesel prices are soaring. People are crying due to inflation. There is a great disappointment among people,” he claimed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The AAP leader was here for the hearing of a Rs 5,000 crore defamation suit filed in a city court against him by industrialist Anil Ambani over Singh’s comments on the Rafale deal. Modi has “hurt the dignity of the office of prime minister” by signing the Rafale fighter jet deal, Singh said.”Rafale deal is the biggest scam in the country. Are you the prime minister of a few corporates, or of the people of Gujarat, or the country?” the AAP leader asked.
On the defamation case, Singh said those “raising their voice against them are slapped with defamation suits”. “Since court fee is free (zero) in Gujarat, anybody can come here and file a defamation suit of Rs 5,000 crore or Rs 10,000 crore,” he said."

The drive to collect iron to build the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, on the Narmada, seems to have fizzled out. The Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) godown in the Chhani area of Vadodara, which has been the repository for the iron brought from across India, has seen little action over the last two months.
The last truck carrying palletized cartons containing the trademark white and orange boxes of farm tools, a bottle of village soil and a satin scroll containing the names of the contributors and a form with details of the village, arrived here on April 24 from Ahmedabad, according to official records.
A laminated white placard hangs on the gate, directing those wishing to hand over “contents” for the Statue of Unity to three representatives of SSNL, whose phones numbers have been mentioned. Inside the compound, the sheds stand locked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Records at the SSNNL office in Narmada Bhavan in Vadodara show 16 states have contributed zero iron tools to the project, which was an important part of Narendra Modi’s campaign for prime ministership. Some of these states are BJP ruled — Rajasthan, for example, has sent nothing.
The entire Northeast — Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim, Mizoram and Nagaland — has remained aloof, while kits from Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Punjab are “awaited”.
Karnataka has sent only five resource kits, while BJP-ruled Goa has sent 386.
Uttar Pradesh has contributed the largest number of kits — 40,000 — beating Modi’s home state Gujarat to the second place with 33,000 kits. Tamil Nadu sent 12,000; Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh 10,000 each.
Sources said the movement to collect iron for the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which was compared to the drive to collect bricks for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, fell flat after NGO Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG) exited in January, after having completed its mandate of designing and rolling out the project’s pan-India outreach and social mobilisation plan.
According to sources, SSNL was entrusted with the implementation of the project three years ago, but for two years, it could not come up with a plan on how to collect iron for the project. It was then, in August 2013, that CAG was roped. It was asked to come up with a plan to reach out to people, ask them to contribute iron and soil for the project, and to build a buzz around it. The CAG website says it conducted “1 regional workshop in each of the South, East, West and North-East regions and 2 workshops in the North region”.
Last December, Modi, as chief minister of Gujarat, flagged off a convoy of trucks that were to travel across India on a drive to collect iron tools from seven lakh villages. The statue was to be 182 metres tall, and was to come up 3.5 km downstream from the Sardar Sarovar dam, soaring nearly 19 over above the height of the dam measured from its foundation.
The CAG’s web site claims that 700 tonnes of used farm iron has already been collected from several states across the country. It says three lakh “Resource Kit Box” had been sent across the country “to collect used farm tools as symbolic contributions towards the construction of Statue of Unity”.
Sources said only 1.26 lakh kits have so far “returned” to the godown.
When the Indian Express team visited the shed shared by Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in the SSNNL godown last week, only 94 boxes were marked “J&K”. The boxes, purportedly from J&K, bore transport stickers that read “Uttar Pradesh”, with “Jammu” written by hand on the back of the cover. Like other boxes, they had rusted parts of an old cycle, blades of farm equipment, screws, nuts and bolts.
“The CAG was behind the concept of taking the Statue of Unity to villages to make it an all-India campaign to take Modiji’s name to villages. They created a buzz around it on social media and it became popular. It worked during the election campaign, but now the CAG has taken a back seat, and so has the Statue of Unity campaign,” said a BJP leader.
Sources in CAG, however, blamed the Gujarat government. “CAG had a limited mandate to put together a strategy on how to reach out to people and involve them in the drive to collect iron and soil from across the country. We were also asked to build a buzz around the project which we successfully did. The implementation, collection, etc., was never our responsibility. We ceased to be part of the project from January onwards,” said a senior CAG member.
Another member said the Gujarat government had lost interest in the project because it had served its purpose.
According to the Statue of Unity web site, technical bids were to be opened on January 31. Asked about the delay, SSNNL managing director J N Singh said, “We will be opening tender bids in 10 days’ time, and work will start soon”.

The annual report of SSNNL for the year 2018-’19, tabled in the recently concluded monsoon session of the Gujarat Assembly, stated that “land has been given on token rent of Rs 1 per annum” to various projects being developed to attract tourists to the predominantly tribal region of the state.
Of the 234 acres given on token rent for 30 years, 34 acres have been allocated to the Tent City, which is run by a private operator and is located five kilometres away from the SoU and the Sardar Sarovar dam. Similarly, the biggest chunk of land – 44 hectares – has been given for a Jungle Safari, which is one of the 30 projects being developed near the SoU. Jungle Safari and the other eight projects who have been given land on token rentals are part of these 30 projects meant to attract tourists near the dam. “Tent City is the government project of the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited (TCGL) and we have given the land to the government company on a token rent. We didn’t wish to charge the government agencies commercially and so, we have given land at token rentals,” a senior official from SSNNL told The Indian Express.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Similarly, 48,856 square meters of land have been given for construction of guesthouses of other states and another 1.59 lakh square meters have been given to Western Railway, which is in the process of providing rail connectivity to the SoU.
Land has also been given for Vishwa Van (60,200 square meters), Ekta Nursery (25,000 square meters) and Educational institutions (59,167 square meters).
“These lands have been given on token rent during the early part of 2019,” the official said.
SSNNL, which has been set up by the government of Gujarat to execute, operate and maintain the Sardar Sarovar Project comprising a dam and canal system, have as of March 31, 2019, acquired 59,540 hectares. “Most of this land acquisition was carried out for the dam and the canal network in the 1960s,” the official added.
During the year 2018-’19, over 15.61 lakh tourists visited Kevadiya Colony. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the SoU on October 31, 2018, over 12 lakh visitors have visited SoU in the first five months.
In the past, too, SSNNL has given land near Kevadia colony on Rs 1 annual rental. This includes land for the Industrial Training centre in 2009, quarter for staff of the Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited and the Gujarat State Cooperative Bank."

Three kilometres from the river island of Sadhu Bet, Sattuben Tadvi has again set up a stall along the road in Navagaam village, hoping to profit from the heavy movement of cars headed to Sardar Patel’s statue. Her stall was removed last week from the road as it was raised and levelled ahead of the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue. A widow and mother to two children, Sattuben claims she made twice the revenue by afternoon from a crowd never “witnessed before”. “It feels like a miracle, an overnight change. Changes and developments happened within hours and we saw it all.”
A few metres from Sattuben’s home, Seetaben Tadvi (27) is happy to get a job after her house was partially demolished for construction of the road. She claims that she has been employed to clean the roads every day and will be paid Rs 7,500 per month for the job. She says that she doesn’t know her employer but claims that she has been working for the last three days.

At Koriya village of 25 households in Garudeshwar taluka, 15 km from Sadhu Bet, villagers seem unaffected by the buzz of activity on the two-lane SH 63 adjacent to the hamlet and connected to it by a kutcha road.
“We can see the statue from across our farm, but its still far… I would want to go and visit it some day,” says Hemant Tadvi (72), who lives with his son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren in a house partly constructed under the Indira Awas Yojana.

Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel inaugurated the work on concrete foundation raft of the Statue of Unity, to mark the 65th death anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Tuesday. Taking a moment to thank Narendra Modi led NDA government for clearing the state government’s request for installation of 30 sluice gates on Narmada Dam to raise its height to 138.68 meters, Anandiben said that Sardar Patel would be “proud” that the BJP has fulfilled his dream of constructing the Narmada Dam for the benefit of farmers.
Anandiben paid her tributes to Sardar Patel at the venue, held over the bailey bridge constructed for the purpose of transporting construction materials, and said that the extension of the height of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam will benefit farmers even on “borders of Pakistan”.
Speaking at the event, Anandiben said, “I have inaugurated the foundation raft concrete work on the Statue of Sardar Patel, which was envisioned by Narendra bhai (Modi), as the world’s tallest statue.

Anandiben also said that the work of installation of 30 sluice gates over the Narmada dam would also be completed by next year, raising the height of the dam from 121.92 meters to 138.68 meters. Anandiben credited the prudence of the Modi-led NDA government for clearing the state government’s eight year old plea.
“The work of installation of the gates is on. Once complete, it will ensure that water will be supplied right until the border of Pakistan. Currently, we have already ensured that Kutch receives water. This dam, commissioned in 1961, had been Sardar Patel’s dream and he will be proud that the BJP has made his dream come true. We petitioned the UPA government for eight years since 2006, but it took Narendra bhai only 17 days to clear the file when he assumed office of the Prime Minister,” Anandiben said.
SS Rathod, Director, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) said, “From the time of the inauguration at the hands of Anandiben, the raft foundation work will continue round the clock for six days. Close to 4500 cubic meters of concrete will be compressed with ice in a process that follows precision so as to ensure that there is no heat in the mixture.”
The 3-meter deep raft foundation will now see round-the-clock concreting for the next six days to ensure safe bearing capacity of 2300 KPA, officials said. Rathod added that the museum and memorial park would be completed before the construction of the feet of the statue begins, next year. Rathod added that this phase of the project will also complete the construction of the main bridge connecting the statue to the Narmada bank as well as the road along the bank leading to Sadhu Bet.
The contract for the project was handed over to L&T, in October 2014 and the estimated cost of the project is about Rs 2980 crores. The project includes an exhibition hall, audio visual presentation on the life of Sardar Patel as well a memorial park."

Bringing the issue of legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel back in public discourse, Congress on Monday accused BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi of “misguiding” the common people on leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and the independent India’s first home minister.
“People of the state are being misguided about Sardar Patel and I want to ask a question to those who are talking about constructing the ‘Statue of Unity’ that why were they silent despite being in power for more than one-and-half decades”, said Union Minister of Mines Dinshaw Patel.
He was speaking on the occasion of inaugurating Rajkot-Sarai Rohilla (Delhi) weekly express train service here. The “statue of unity” is said to be the dream project of the Gujarat chief minister who had last year laid the foundation stone for the statue coming up near Sardar Sarovar dam project.
“They (leaders) are talking about spending crores of rupees on the project but have contributed nothing to Sardar Patel museum at Shahibaug in Ahmedabad”, said Patel, also the chairman of Sardar Patel Memorial Society. He also accused the state government of working only for the benefit of corporates, saying the UPA government at Centre has taken a number of steps for welfare of the common man in the fields of health and education. On the train service, he said the train would run every Thursday between Rajkot and Sarai Rohilla (Delhi) and return to Rajkot on every Friday."

(File)
The world’s tallest statue, Statue of Unity (SoU), in Kevadia Colony of Gujarat, was put up “for sale” on online marketplace OLX, prompting the authorities to take down the advertisement and file a complaint.

The statue, a towering memorial dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was put up for sale for Rs 30,000 crore to donate the money for medical and healthcare equipment in view of coronavirus spread. The description read, “Emergency! Selling Statue of Unity because of urgent money required for hospitals and healthcare equipment.”
After an article appeared in a local newspaper, the SoU authorities on Sunday approached the police to file a complaint against an unknown person for the listing. “An unknown person, with a mala fide intention to defame the government had put up the Statue of Unity for sale on OLX, despite not being authorised to do so,” a release signed by Nilesh Dubey Chief Administrator, Statue of Unity, stated. “It is appalling that the online marketplace OLX did not verify the post and approved it…,” the release added.
An FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 505 (publishes, circulates any rumours), 417 (Punishment for cheating) and 469 (forgery), as well as under the Information and Technology Act, against an unknown person. “We received a complaint from the authorities and have filed an FIR. We are now tracing the source of the listing made on OLX,” police said.
A major attraction since its inauguration on October 31, 2018, the SoU was closed for tourists since March 17 after a directive by the Gujarat government."

While BJP registered a clear lead in Gujarat in the initial rounds of the Assembly polls, Central Gujarat recorded mixed results. While most turncoat MLAs, who defected from the Congress to the BJP, registered losses, only CK Raulji of Godhra Assembly is leading with a comfortable margin.
In Kheda district, Congress is leading the final round of counting in Matar constituency. Candidate Sanjay Patel is leading by over 4,000 votes against BJP’s sitting MLA Kesrisinh Solanki. Congress won the Thasra Assembly constituency, with Kanti Parmar defeating turncoat leader Ramsinh Parmar, who has been a five-term MLA from the seat and is also the chairman of Amul Dairy.
BJP candidate Mansinh Chauhan from Balasinor is also trailing behind Congress candidate. Congress candidate Kalu Dabhi won the Kapadvanj Assembly in Kheda district, which was earlier represented by Shankarsinh Vaghela. Vaghela did not field a candidate from his Jan Vikalp-All India Hindustan Congress party front for Kapadvanj. Vaghela, however, had lent support to Bimal Shah, an independent candidate, who had also served as Transport Minister of the state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

However, the biggest upset for BJP came in the tribal district of Narmada as both sitting MLAs – Motisinh Vasava from Dediapada constituency and Shabdasharan Tadvi from Nandod constituency- were trailing behind the Congress-Bhartiya Tribal Party combine in the final round. Rebel JD(U) leader Chhotu Vasava’s son Mahesh Vasava, who is contesting from Dediapada Assembly in Narmada district, is leading over BJPs’ sitting MLA Moti Vasava. In Nandod, Congress candidate Premsinh Vasava has a clear lead over sitting MLA Tadvi. Incidentally, Narmada district, which recorded the highest voter turn out in the polls at 79%, is home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project, the 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhai Patel.

In Vadodara, BJP candidates Seema Mohile from Akota, Manisha Vakil from Vadodara City, Jitendra Sukhadia from Sayajigunj, Rajendra Trivedi from Raopura and Yogesh Patel from Manjalpur constituencies registered comfortable victories. All the five urban seats have been traditional BJP bastions. In Vadodara rural, Waghodia BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav won by a margin of over 12,000 votes, while Karjan MLA Satish Patel scraped through. Ketan Inamdar, sitting MLA of Savli in Vadodara, also registered a thumping win, while Padra sitting MLA Dinesh Patel is set to face an upset from Congress candidate Jaspalsinh Thakor.
Of the 7 constituencies in Anand district, Congress won five and BJP two. Congress retained Borsad, Anklav, Sojitra, Petlad and wrested Anand from BJP. The BJP had fielded Yogesh Patel, dropping sitting MLA Rohit Patel from Anand. Congress’ Kanti Soda Parmar won from Anand. BJP, however, retained Khambhat with new candidate Mayur Raval and won Umreth with Govind Parmar. NCP candidate Jayant Patel, who was sitting MLA in Umreth, lost. In Chhota Udepur, Congress’s heavyweight and sitting MLA Mohan Rathwa managed to scrape through with a 700 vote lead in the end."

Cities across the country have witnessed significant changes over the past 10-15 years on the back of high economic growth, infrastructure development and evolution of the services sector.
If the six metros — New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore — witnessed the bulk of development in the first phase, the next phase will see the emergence of tier II and III cities with a sizeable jump in their economic activities.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The enclosure will also include an Interpretation Centre as well as a rehabilitation centre for rescued crocodiles spread over an additional 3,000 square meters, which will be off-display for the public. The Director of the Zoological Park has invited bids for the proposed crocodile enclosure, which is estimated to cost about Rs 98 lakh.
However, the authorities are “yet to decide” if the crocodiles on display will be from the Narmada river, which has been home to the muggers or whether they will be brought in as part of an “exchange” programme from elsewhere.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The zoo authorities floated tenders inviting bids early in December. The plan includes crocodile holding pen with sand floor and puff panel roof as well as a keeper’s gallery with anti-skid floors. It has been designed by a Delhi-based architect and also includes “saucer shaped water bodies” within each enclosure to recreate the natural environment. The enclosures will have a moat and a retaining wall to ensure safety and distancing.
Dr RR Nala, Director of the Zoological Park, Kevadia, told this newspaper that the process to invite agencies to build the enclosures was on. “It has been part of our plan and we have begun the process to include the crocodile enclosure in the safari park soon. We will have a rehabilitation centre, where rescued crocodiles, who are in need of any medical attention or found injured can be brought in for treatment. This area will be off-display for the public.”
Sources said that while the enclosure was being created to house some of the native crocodiles from the Narmada river, authorities denied that any decision had been made on the same. A senior official said that the process of displaying crocodiles from the Narmada Dam would require special permission from the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA), which encourages exchange between zoos instead.
For several years now, the Narmada reservoir as well as the river, have been used for releasing crocodiles rescued from human habitats, especially Vadodara and Central Gujarat, where the muggers live in their natural habitat amid human settlements. The locals in Narmada also venerate the idol of Goddess Narmada, who is depicted riding on a crocodile.

Nala added that the authorities were yet to plan which crocodiles would be put on display for the public. “We will do it as per the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority of India. We will look at the options of exchange when we get to that point.”
Interestingly, the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) and the forest department had rescued hundreds of crocodiles from Dyke 3 of the Narmada Dam premises, which is now the location for the water aerodrome terminal that connects Kevadia to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. Dyke 3, officially named Panchmuli Lake, was also popularly called “Magar Talav” due to crocodiles residing there. When asked if the rescued crocodiles would be displayed for public after the due process prescribed by the CZA, Additional Chief Secretary(Forest & Environment Deptt) & MD SSNNL Rajiv Kumar Gupta said that no plan was in place yet."

(Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)
A total 4,830 trees will be cut down for the proposed conversion of a 29.6 kilometres road connecting Vadodara to Dabhoi into four lane from the current two-lane, a route that will be important for tourists visiting the Statue of Unity at Kevadia in Narmada district after it is ready for public. The cutting of the trees is inevitable as they stand on both sides bordering the road. In two months, the forest department has managed to chop down around 2,000 trees, and another 2,830 trees will be chopped down in as much time, officials said.
A private contractor has been given the task of cutting the trees which were surveyed by the office of the range forest officers at Vadodara and Dabhoi. “We had conducted the survey and marked the trees around two years ago, even though the work on cutting them has begun now as the Roads and Buildings department has given green signal to convert the road into four-lane,” said RFO Vadodara P B Chauhan.

The private contractor has deployed JCB machines, trucks and a team of labourers to cut and transport the trees to a godown at Ashapura from where the forest department will auction them off after the work is completed. “As many as 1,117 trees stand on both sides of the road from Vadodara and a village called Hetampura, which falls under the jurisdiction of Vadodara RFO, while from there to Dabhoi, we have 3,713 trees. The work has started from Dabhoi and will go on till it touches Kapurai chokdi, the last point on the road touching the national highway that connects Vadodara to Surat,” said Dabhoi RFO CC Rohit.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Officials of the R&B department said the work of widening of this state highway was pending since long but has been expedited keeping in view the construction of the government’s ambitious 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity that is coming up at an islet on Narmada river near the Narmada dam. The statue will draw tourists from Ahmedabad and Vadodara, and this road will see heavy traffic. The Statue of Unity site will be around 60 kilometres from Dabhoi."

This is an election of the sort Gujarat hasn’t seen since Narendra Modi first burst onto the scene in 2001. For the first time since then, he isn’t a candidate on the ballot paper in the state. While the BJP, which won all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014, is still seeking votes in the Prime Minister’s name, for the first time in a long time, Modi isn’t top of the mind for most of the state electorate either.
As The Sunday Express travels across Gujarat, from areas where the Patidar anger is now reduced to a footnote and places where the Dalits haven’t forgotten the Una flogging, to where the farmer woes are now aligned with a common national narrative, calculations across parties seem based on an old familiar: caste. It may still be a long way from when the Congress had it sealed with its KHAM (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi, Muslim) formula, but having reduced the BJP to its lowest tally of 99 out of 182 seats since 1995, in the 2017 Assembly elections, and dealt a public humiliation to the BJP over a Rajya Sabha seat, the party hopes to make more progress.
That is, if it gets its act together. The Assembly high is already frittered away with the BJP wooing five of its 77 MLAs so far. In the run-up to the polls, the Congress failed to strike any alliances, not even with old ally NCP, while talks with the Bharatiya Tribal Party’s Chhotu Vasava for Bharuch didn’t pan out.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Congress president Rahul Gandhi did all of five rallies in the state, that votes on April 23, mostly talking about the Rafale deal and accusing the BJP of protecting rich bank defaulters. Modi has held six so far and is scheduled to do one more in Patan on Sunday. At his meeting in Amreli on April 18, an emotional PM urged people to “gift 26 lotuses” to him as he was “their man in Delhi”.

Patidars, and others
On the main street of Chhattar village in Kalawad taluka of Jamnagar district, a shop running out of an extended home is also distributing BJP paraphernalia these days. Owner and sarpanch Jaisukh Tada, a Leuva Patel, says that in 2015, he had himself driven villagers in his SUV to a Hardik Patel rally at the height of the Patidar agitation. “I was proud that this boy was out to do something for my community… But we got to know soon enough that he was a money-minded Congressman,” says Tada. Click here for more election news 
The anger over Hardik having joined hands with the Congress runs high, with little rancour over the fact that he is unable to contest because of conviction in a case related to the agitation.
Of the 15 Congress MLAs who had won (13 in Saurashtra and two in north Gujarat) on the strength of that anger in 2017, three are now with the BJP. These three Assembly seats, along with Manavadar which had fallen vacant after the Congress MLA defected to BJP will see bypolls simultaneously with the Lok Sabha on April 23. One by-election was held on December 20, re-electing Kunvarji Bavaliya, a Congress MLA who too had joined BJP in July last year.
One of these seats is Unjha, in which Modi’s native village Vadnagar falls. The Mehsana Lok Sabha seat itself includes both Modi’s and Amit Shah’s native villages. Hardik is barred to campaign in Mehsana district by the court.
While this means that the BJP is now set to earn back a chunk of its traditional Patidar votes, the Congress will lose more OBC support due to Radhanpur MLA and Thakor Sena leader Alpesh Thakor quitting the party along with two other MLAs, citing “injustice to the community”. The swing of Patidar and OBC votes is set to reflect in Banaskantha, Patan, Mehsana and Sabarkantha seats in north Gujarat.

Vasava, whose vote was decisive in Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s win in the Rajya Sabha election, kept waiting for the party to make up its mind on an alliance. Not just Bharuch, his party’s vote base among tribals could cost the Congress dear in the Lok Sabha seats of Chhota Udepur, Bardoli and Navsari in central and south Gujarat. Tribals make up 15 per cent of the population in the state.


	ExplainedCaste, local issues in focusGujarat will see a first election in 18 years where PM Modi is not a candidate. Unlike 2014, caste calculations are expected to dominate the political discourse. While Modi is expecting his home state to repeat its performance of 2014, the Congress, having reduced the BJP to 99 seats in the 2017 Assembly polls, its lowest since 1995, it will hope to do better.

Spokesperson Raju Dhruv says the Patidars, Kolis, as well as other voters’ groups will favour the BJP. “It is true that Patidars were misled for sometime, but this community has always put the nation first. They have faith in the work being done by PM Modi and Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani. Similarly, Kolis will not be swayed by the false propaganda of the Congress.”
Dhandhuka under Surendranagar parliamentary seat is considered the “gateway” to Saurashtra, which has been struggling with drought. Most of the 51 talukas across 11 districts declared drought hit by the state government are in the Saurashtra-Kutch region. However, the theme of the campaign of sitting Congress MLA from Limdi, Somabhai Patel, one of the tallest Koli leaders in Gujarat, is his caste. Somabhai is contesting from Surendranagar.
An old BJP veteran, he taps into the anti-lower caste sentiments against the BJP, asking for votes for the Congress “so that we don’t lose our azaadi”. “If by mistake Modi comes back, you will lose your right to vote. I say this with complete confidence. The Constitution made by Babasaheb will be thrown into the sea.”
Kolis form the largest OBC group in Gujarat, at 20 per cent of the population, and dominate Surendranagar, Bhavnagar and Junagadh seats in Saurashtra and Navsari in south Gujarat.
In Navsari, the Kolis had demanded the BJP nominate one of them instead of sitting MP C R Patil. Bavaliya, one of the tallest Koli leaders in the state had to intervene after the BJP re-named Patil. The Congress fancies its chances with its candidate Dharmesh Patel, a Koli.

Says Somabhai, “The Koli samaj will not vote for the BJP… The party does not have good people and so it is breaking the Congress. It is afraid 33 per cent of its own MLAs will leave, so they are luring Congress MLAs.”
Soon after Bavaliya defected to the BJP in July last year, he was made a minister of cabinet rank by the ruling party. Bavaliya, who is also the national president of the Akhil Bharatiya Koli Samaj, says the BJP has sent a strong message to Kolis by making him minister, and this would help the party retain the Koli-dominated Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Surendranagar seats. “The BJP has made the voice of Kolis heard in government decisions,” he says.
On the caste balance, the BJP also has the support of the powerful OBC group Chaudharys of north Gujarat, who control the dairy industry. The influential leaders among them include former Gujarat minister Shankar Chaudhary, who chairs Banas Dairy, that is said to be Asia’s largest milk union.

Both the Congress and BJP have tapped into the dairy vote bank — the Congress’s Parthi Bhatol once headed the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, which markets the Amul brand, while the BJP’s Parbat Patel (an MoS in the Rupani government) is a director in Banas Dairy.
Over at Navagam village in Surendranagar, the Kolis claim they have been suppressed for decades by the Bharwads, the traditional cattle-rearing community who are also OBCs.
Mahendrabhai Magvania, a Chunvaliya Koli and husband of sarpanch Jhiniben, is nursing a broken leg since he was attacked by the Bharwads some eight months back for his wife standing for sarpanch elections. The Kolis say the Bharwads try to take possession of their land by letting lose their cattle to graze on it. The Bharwads say they have had to leave the village on account of the pushback by Kolis.

Still, Mahendrabhai says, his vote is for Modi, irrespective of who the BJP candidate is. “Modi has given us grants, built roads, deepened ponds, installed streetlights,” he says.

All 26 seats in the state go to the polls on April 23 (Javed Raja)
But near the village square, four elderly men smoking beedis say it is “doctorsaheb (BJP candidate Mahendra Munjpara)” that they are voting for, due to his caste. Samadbhai Magvaniya claims Modi does not matter. As does Navganbhai Kashibhai, puffing away. “Modi hoy ke koi bhi hoy, aapda samaaj no manas ne j vote apaay (Be it Modi or anyone, vote will go to the one from our community).”
The Dalit factor
On the way to Navagam village, stands a memorial for three Dalit boys killed in a clash with police in 2012. The three had been killed after the Dalits crowded the Thangadh police station to lodge a complaint about an altercation with Bharwads at the town fair. An inquiry report is still not out.
The parents of the deceased have been agitating for justice, and the father of one of the deceased, Valji Rathod, is now contesting from Gandhinagar as an Independent against Amit Shah. “We have been fighting for justice for so many years with no result,” he told The Sunday Express while filing his nomination.
Hoping to tap into the Dalit anger, simmering since the Una incident when members of the community were publicly flogged, the Congress has fielded its Una MLA Punja Vansh against BJP sitting MP Rajesh Chudasama from Junagadh. Dalits constitute nearly 7 per cent of the population in Gujarat.
In March, the Una Dalits sat on a week-long protest demanding land promised to them after the flogging. But officials cited the Model Code of Conduct to say their hands were tied.
A group of Dalits gathered at the Ambedkar Chowk in Upleta in Porbandar say it’s price rise that has “finished” them during the Modi reign. “For the poor like us, the Congress is good. Parties work only for industrialists, those who work for the people will win,” says Gopal Katariya, who provides masonry services.
Bullet train vs relief
In Vadodara, Valsad, Surat and Navsari districts, work is on on the bullet train project. The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) along with the Gujarat government has to acquire 612 hectares in the state. But officials have been struggling to convince farmers to part with their land.
Farmers, mainly from south Gujarat, had organised under the Gujarat Khedut Samaj to move the high court against the amendment to the 2013 land acquisition law by the state government overruling the requirement of social impact assessment. The BJP government had filed affidavits and begun awarding compensation as per market value to those farmers consenting to part with their land.
But while the Modi government projects the Mumbai-Ahmedabad train, to run at speeds up to 320 kmph, as its showpiece project, the BJP makes no mention of it in its rallies.
Meanwhile, BJP sitting MPs K C Patel of Valsad and Prabhu Vasava of Bardoli have been questioned by people at their meetings, including over the land acquisition for the Par-Tapi-Narmada river linking project.

All politicians have been barred entry for campaigning in the Kshatriya-dominated Shishang village in the Jamnagar Lok Sabha seat. “We allowed you only because you are from the media,” says Ashoksinh Jadeja, 53, who owns 80 bighas and claims to have taken voluntary retirement as head constable because he was “tired of the BJP”.
The Modi government’s latest farmer scheme PM-KISAN, unveiled just before the polls, doesn’t lure him either. Questioning the

Rs 6,000 per annum assistance it awards, Jadeja says, “Of the Rs 2,000 first installment, I had to spend Rs 400 on paperwork to get myself enlisted as a beneficiary.” Noting that theirs used to be a BJP village, he adds, “They took away roti from my plate. Why should I vote for the BJP?”
Hardevsinh Jadeja, who is a Congress supporter, says he is ready to face action for speaking out against the BJP government. “They can book me for rashtradroh (sedition). Let them.”
Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has been talking about an exclusive farmers’ budget and promising not to imprison anyone for loan default. Modi highlighted the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and the Kisan credit card.
But others warn that the farmer anger could translate into total “nirasta (disinterest)” for the elections, including towards the Congress. “What is the use of voting? There is no democracy left,” says Shishang’s Hardevsinh who is a farmer and has been a Congress supporter since “Rajiv Gandhi’s time”.

At a paan shop in Upleta, a farmer who is part of a group gathered at a shop at the end of the day for their daily dose of phaaki (a mixture of tobacco, betel nut and lime paste), says they don’t need anything from the government. A Patidar, he is also a government teacher and doesn’t want to identify himself. “Just give us water,” he says. “We don’t want any loan or insurance scheme. We will produce everything the country needs… except rice maybe.”
Where is the water?
That water could change many a fortune is evident across the 600-km stretch in Saurashtra that The Sunday Express travelled through. Barring sporadic green patches of bajra, cabbage, beans, onion and fodder fields, the region and its local rivers are completely parched.
The semi-arid region has no perennial river and following a poor monsoon, a majority of dams are dry this summer. Government supplies Narmada water to farmers in Surendranagar, Morbi, Botad and Bhavnagar districts while major dams like Shetrunji and Bhadar-I help irrigate fields in a few dozen other villages. But large parts of the region that remain dependent on groundwater sources are struggling.
Under its ambitious Saurashtra Narmada Avataran Irrigation scheme, the state government is laying giant pipelines to connect 115 dams of Saurashtra with canals of Narmada dam. But this year, not many of the 115 have received water. As a drought relief measure, the state government has paid farmers Rs 5,300-Rs 6,800 per hectare as input subsidy.
But angry farmers in Rajkot, Devbhoomi Dwarka etc have staged protests alleging arbitrariness by insurance companies in settlement of insurance claims for crop loss.
But it’s all about Balakot
Rajesh Gohil, Congress MLA from Dhandhuka, insists, “Just by doing air strikes, and swaying people emotionally, the BJP cannot win.” He accuses the BJP of wooing the urban areas by “communalising”, by accusing the Congress of “speaking the language of Pakistan”.
BJP top campaigners, including Modi, Amit Shah and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, have, in different ways, played on the Pulwama-Balakot events to emphasise on the “tough Modi-led government”, seeking votes in the name of “national security”.
At Patidar village Chhattar, sarpanch Jaisukh Tada says “the air strikes will help the BJP”. Despite the anger against Hardik Patel, despite the lingering hope for the quota movement, he says, “First comes the nation. If the country is safe, only then we are safe.” However, he laments non-availability of irrigation water and damage to crops by animals.

BJP spokesperson Dhruv claims Modi is set to get the Muslim vote too. “They have benefited from the communal harmony and law and order during Modi’s reign. The Congress always treated Muslims as a vote bank and thus the community was left behind,” he says.

The Pulwama/Balakot narrative forced the Congress to return to the drawing board. The party, which was to hold its working committee meeting in Gujarat after 60 years on February 28, had to reschedule it as well as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s first rally as general secretary.
But the BJP has used another “national pride” narrative sparingly. On April 19, campaigning in Chhota Udepur, the constituency where the Statue of Unity is situated, Amit Shah made no mention of it. In 2017, the Assembly seat of Nandod was won by the Congress even as the statue was being readied.
Referring to Modi’s charge on April 18 that none of the Congress leaders had visited this architectural marvel of his government, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi says, “All they are doing is politicising Sardar Patel. Had they really been concerned about him, they would have finished the Sardar Sarovar Project on the Narmada by building all the minor canals.”
He adds that May 23 would mark a victory for the Congress manifesto, winning it the support of all castes and communities. “We have announced a Krishi budget and farmers belong to all communities.”"

With monsoon yet to set in, the rising water level in the Narmada dam — for the second year in a row — is good news for the state as it is heavily dependent on the dam for water. Officials said that the dam added over 43 centimetres to its level overnight on Friday.
The steady inflow of an average of 6,000 cusecs water into the reservoir upstream from Madhya Pradesh’s Indirasagar dam has meant that the live storage in the Sardar Sarovar basin is 2,593 million cubic metres (MCM).
The Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) increased the outflow into the main canal from 6,000 cusecs to 7,117 cusecs on Friday. The Indirasagar dam in MP, which releases the water after power generation to Gujarat, has been steadily contributing to the increase in the water level.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This is the second consecutive year when the basin has risen over the previous overflow level of 121.92 metres, before the work on the installation of 30 gates was completed in 2017 to raise the height of the dam to 138.63 metres. Last year, the Narmada dam reached the momentous figure of 138.63 metres in the extended monsoon in September.
A senior official said that as per the protocol, once the dam reservoir reaches 133 metres, the Riverbed Powerhouse (RBPH) would have to be operated to utilize the water and balance the inflow and outflow as the dam inches closer to its Full Reservoir Level (FRL).
The completion of the Garudeshwar Weir this year, 12 kilometres downstream from the dam, will help retain the water released from the powerhouse — after generation of hydropower — around the Statue of Unity (SoU), which is located 3.5 kilometres downstream. The SoU management plans to start a jetty service that will help tourists travel along the six-kilometres stretch downstream from the statue towards the weir, once tourist activities open after the Covid-19 lockdown ends."

On Tuesday,Modi shared the dais with PM Manmohan Singh at the inauguration of the Sardar Patel museum where he said that had Patel been made the first Prime Minister of India,the fate and face of India would have been different. The last time Modi and Advani  were together,after the former was named the PM candidate,was on October 16 at the inauguration of the Sabarmati Riverfront garden. 
Incidentally,the name missing from the invitation card for the grand event in the tribal district of Narmada is that of Cabinet minister for agriculture and water supply Babu Bokhiria,who has recently faced injunctions from the Gujarat High Court over encroachments.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi is expected to address a gathering of over 20,000 people at a school campus in Kevadia at 11 am,following which he will go to a spot on the bank of the Narmada river near Sadhu Tekri where he will perform the groundbreaking puja at an auspicious time of 12:39 pm. The site of the puja is around 6 kilometre from where he will address the public. October 31,the date of the ceremony,is celebrated as the 138th birth anniversary of Indias first home minister Sardar Patel.
The other invitees to the event  Nitin Patel,Anandi Patel,Saurabh Patel,Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Ganpat Vasava  will also accompany him to the puja ceremony. Tribal MP Mansukh Vasava has been invited as a special guest. Modi will also inaugurate the work to build the Garudeshwar Weir which will ensure water around the Sadhu Bet where the Sardar Patel statue is expected to come up. This will support boating and other tourism-related activity.
Police said tight security arrangements had been made for the programme,but refused to divulge more details. After the Patna incident,we have taken all precautionary measures. We are not in a position to talk about it in details, Narmada SP Pravin Mall said. 
Tribals living in 70 villages around the site of the statue have said they will go ahead with their protest on the same day of Modis programme at Kevadia,despite the government having verbally agreed to many of their demands. Villages opposing the construction of Garudeshwar Weir that submerges seven villages will hold fast in large numbers on October 31. 
The Statue of Unity,to be constructed on Sadhu Bet,an isle situated 3.2 kilometre from the site of the Narmada dam,will be the tallest in the world,almost double the size of Statue of Liberty in New York. The first phase of the construction will cost Rs 2,063 crore and is expected to be completed in 42 months. Bids for the first phase of construction have already been invited. The statue will have steel framing,reinforced cement concrete (RCC) and bronze coating,involving 35,000 tonne cement,3,725 tonne steel and 1,500 tonne bronze.

On October 9, 2018, 35-year-old Taraben Tadvi’s house and shop on the main road leading up to the Statue of Unity in Waghadia village in Gujarat’s Narmada district was demolished to widen the road ahead of the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue. Since then, Tadvi’s family of four — classified as BPL; the family belongs to the Tadvi Scheduled Tribe — along with seven other families, has been moved to the interiors of Waghadia village. With the aid of a few government schemes, they have now built a two-room mud and tin house and a small shop, but the relocation has taken its toll.
1) Taraben Tadvi (35)
In 2015, Tadvi took a loan of Rs 5,000 under the Gujarat government’s Sakhi Mandal Yojna — an initiative to empower women in rural areas through financial assistance — to set up her shop, where she sells snacks, tea, cold drinks and petrol. “Back then, my shop was on the main road and was very popular with tourists. I would easily earn Rs 700-1,000 a day and, during weddings and festivals, I would make an extra Rs 500 as well,” she says. In the years that followed, Tadvi repaid her loan and also invested in a life insurance scheme, paying Rs 947 per month. “But ever since I have moved here, my only customers are members of the seven other families who shifted with us. There is no one else. My income has dropped to Rs 100 a day. It is becoming increasingly difficult to make ends meet,” she says.
The family had built their old home under the Indira Awas Yojna. In 2016, they also built a toilet after receiving Rs 12,000 under the Swachh Bharat mission. Their new house does not have a toilet and the women go out in the open to relieve themselves.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The family is also entitled to the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna, but are yet to avail its benefits. Taraben, along with other women from the neighbourhood, venture deep into the woods, almost a kilometre away from their house, to gather firewood for cooking. Earlier, she bought firewood from a man who sourced it from the forests and sold it. “He does not sell it here anymore,” complains Tadvi.
2) Husband Savai Tadvi (38)
Taraben’s husband Savai has been unemployed since the relocation. Earlier, he was employed as a contractual labourer at the Statue of Unity site under the MNREGA scheme. His contract ended in October 2018. For the past four months, since the family was relocated, he has been busy setting up the home. “Earlier I worked as a labourer in the Kutch-Bhuj area, where I earned Rs 200 per day. At the Statue of Unity site too I made the same amount. I am now looking for work at the Garudeshwar weir dam construction site,” he says.
The Statue of Unity was inaugurated on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
3) Son Tarun Tadvi (14)
Tarun, a Class 9 student, is enrolled at a government school in Boriya village, 5 km away. He takes a shared auto to go to school, that costs Rs 10 per day. Every year Rs 550 is credited to his account under the Right to Education Act. His parents do not pay any additional fees for his education.
Daughter Yogeshwari Tadvi (18)
Yogeshwari is pursuing her diploma in Computer Operator and Programming Assistance (COPA) from ITI Kevadia. She is entitled to a scholarship under the National Fellowship and Scholarship for Higher Education for ST students. She has filled up the form and is waiting for the Rs 4,500 to be credited into her account. As she is pursuing a computer-related course, she is also entitled to receive a tablet under the Gujarat government’s Tablet Sahay Yojna next month. In Class 9, she got a cycle under the Saraswati Sadhna Yojna, but she prefers to walk to her college. “I have paid Rs 5,000 as fees. I hope to receive the Rs 4,500 scholarship soon. The tablet will also help me with my practical assignments. I can’t afford to buy it on my own,” she says."

Dedicating the abrogation of special status of Jammu & Kashmir to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on National Unity Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the provision under Article 370 only promoted “terrorism and separatism” and was therefore, necessary to be done away with.
“The new system in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is not meant to draw a line on the land (to draw a boundary) but to build a strong link of trust,” the prime minister, who was attending a function at the Statue of Unity in Gujarat on the occasion of Patel’s 144th birth anniversary, said.
The PM said he dedicated the Centre’s August 5 decision to scrap the controversial provision of the Constitution “at the feet of” independent India’s first home minister.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“That wall was promoting separatism and terrorism. I am here today to humbly tell Sardar Patel that the wall has been demolished,” Modi said.
Inspired by Patel, the government is working for “emotional, economic and constitutional integration” of the country, without which it would be difficult to imagine a powerful India in the 21st century, he added.
On August 5, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union Territories, which came into existence today.
The Prime Minister also took a swipe at Pakistan, saying those “who cannot win wars” against India are trying to destroy its unity.
He added that some elements are trying to destroy the unity in diversity of India by spreading separatism and terrorism, but even after “trying for centuries, nobody could annihilate us or defeat us”.
“Unity in diversity is our pride and our identity, the world is surprised by our unity despite so much diversity,” Modi said.
“The greatest challenge of the 21st century for our enemies is to destroy this unity in diversity,” he added.
In a veiled dig at Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister whom the ruling BJP often blames for the decades-old Kashmir issue, Modi said, “Patel had once said that had he handled the Kashmir issue, it would not have taken so long to resolve it.
“North-East is now moving from separatism to attachment as decades-old problems are nearing resolution,” he added, referring to the Centre’s initiatives to bring peace to the insurgency-affected region.
India is different from other countries. We celebrate diversity. We do not see any contradictions in diversity. We see unity in it, the Prime Minister said.
“When we respect traditions and beliefs of different sects and religions, love and attachment (among people) increase,” he added.
Modi also addressed young IAS officers at a separate function in Kevadiya called ‘Aarambh’ and asked them to work together for the nation, saying silos and hierarchy don’t help the system.
He called for working towards realing the vision of making India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25.
“This course, Aarambh, is nation-centric and future-centric. It will usher a paradigm shift in administration, whereby people stop working on silos. Instead, people work together and in a comprehensive manner,” a tweet posted on Modi’s official twitter handle -PMO India – quoted him as saying at the event.
Modi said no bureaucratic posting should be seen as a punishment rather it should be treated as an opportunity.
“The presence of silos and hierarchy doesn’t help our system. Whoever we are, wherever we are, we have to work together for the nation,” he added.
“Let’s change how we look at things. Even something like a changed terminology helps. Earlier, people would keep saying backward districts. Today we say aspirational districts. Why should any posting be a punishment posting? Why not see it as an opportunity posting?” the PM said."

After several years of animosity and heated arguments at meetings, the warring groups of the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) have finally decided to work together for important issues such as construction of an indoor cricket stadium in Kotambi, for which land was identified as far back as 2013. At last week’s AGM, the BCA peacefully discussed the backlog of accounts since 2014 that it is yet to clear in order to get its share of Rs 135 crore grant from BCCI. Royal Scion and former BCA head Samarjitsinh Gaekwad attended the meeting after current BCA President Pranav Amin met him in person and extended an olive branch. Gaekwad heads the Royal group while Amin is from the Revival group. Both Gaekwad and Amin have said they would set aside their rivalry for now and get things going. At the AGM, members agreed to appoint an Ombudsman to look into issues plaguing cricket under the board.
OSD For MSU VC
A day after the in-charge registrar of MS University NK Ojha retired and a new registrar, Krishnarajsinh Chudasama, was appointed, the former was appointed as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the capacity of Assistant/Advisor to the vice-chancellor. The announcement was made during the Diwali vacation period, which has attracted the ire of a group of senate members. They questioned the appointment saying there is no provision to appoint an OSD assistant/advisor to the VC when there is already a statutory post of pro vice-chancellor. Senate members also questioned why the decision was taken during the vacation period. A letter in this regard has been sent to the Principal Secretary of the Education department, and an answer is awaited.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Commanding View
New features have been added at the Statue of Unity site in Kevadia, Narmada district to attract tourists. Recently, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi marked the second anniversary of the SoU on October 31, the authorities experimented with the seating arrangement for guests who arrived for the PM’s address. Apart from the regular seating, some guests were also seated at a hilltop nearby that offered a different view of the dais, and it was called the ‘green gallery’. A senior state government officer said that they may arrange for a green gallery at other public events of dignitaries such as the Prime Minister or Chief Minister."

Express
Ahead of the launch of the Statue of Unity on October 31, the Gujarat government is planning to take out Ekta Yatras in 10,000 villages across the state in around 200 chariots before and after the inauguration of the statue.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani launched a website for the yatra – ektayatra.com – here on Friday. The yatra will be spreading Sardar Patel’s message of unity and sovereignty of India.
The yatra will be carried out in two phases in October and November. The first phase will be between October 20 and 29, and the second phase between November 12 and 21.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official release said that the yatra has been organised to ensure that the inauguration of Statue of Unity — the statue of Vallabhbhai Patel — becomes a memorable event for the people of Gujarat. During the yatra, various programmes will be organised in the villages that include essay competition on Sardar Patel, quiz competition, discussions and exhibition of videos, enactment of plays on Sardar Patel, screening of films on patriotism, among others.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) A M Tiwari has been appointed to oversee the entire planning and execution of the Ekta Yatra. At the same time, various district administrations are expected to make the arrangements for the yatra at the village level.
In July last year, Gujarat government had organised similar Narmada Rath Yatra to mark the completion of Sardar Sarovar Dam project. At that time also, the state government had planned to target 10,000 villages across the state. That yatra preceeded the Assembly elections in December last year.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Another important yatra on Swami Vivekanand was carried out by the Gujarat government in 2012 when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of the state. The yatra was called Vivekanand Yuva Vikas Yatra to mark 150 years of Swami Vivekanand’s historic Chicago speech. Modi had begun his election campaign for 2012 Assembly elections through this month-long yatra in September 2012."

(Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana/Archive)
The mugger crocodile, also called marsh crocodile or broad-snouted crocodile, is a species (Crocodylus palustris) native to freshwater habitats from southern Iran and Pakistan to the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. It has come to the centre of renewed attention in Gujarat, where the Forest Department has started evacuating muggers from two ponds on the Sardar Sarovar Dam premises on the Narmada, to facilitate a seaplane service at the Statue of Unity.
Already extinct in Bhutan and Myanmar, the mugger has been listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1982. In India, it is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Among the six schedules in the Act, Schedule I and part II of Schedule II provide the highest degrees of protection to listed species, with the most stringent penalties for offenders.
For animals listed in Schedule I, any of kind of population control activity, capture for captivity, or transportation can involve cumbersome processes. A wildlife expert said: “Any activity involving the animal, technically require permits and sanctions from multiple authorities. It is a tedious process that involves a chain of paperwork, and permissions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This includes even transportation of crocodiles. So its relocation or capture is definitely illegal without permission. However, state governments have the authority to give permissions in some situations where they become a danger for the human population.”
Vadodara, 90 km from the Narmada dam, is the only city in the country where crocodiles live in their natural habitat amidst human population. Crocodiles from the Vishwamitri river, where they number around 300, often enter people’s homes, giving rise to conflict and capture. Most of these crocodiles are thereafter released in the Narmada dam waters, away from human habitats.
Experts say crocodiles were listed under Schedule I not because of the fear of extinction but to prevent their trade. Crocodiles are valued for their skin and flesh. In some cases, they are also worshipped, including in the Narmada. In idols of the Narmada Goddess, a crocodile is her vehicle; there is an idol on the premises of the Narmada Dam. Goddess Khodiyar Maa, who is worshipped by a section of Gujaratis, is also seen riding a crocodile as a symbol of her supremacy over land and water."

According to him,The Statue of Unity project is being carried out with a view to belittling Pandit Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi vis a vis Sardar Patel. Vaidya said that Modi may be saying good things about Sardar,but the institution (RSS) of which he is a product,thinks diametrically opposite and creates confusion about Sardar. Similar confusion is being spread about Swami Vivekanand,Subhaschandra Bose,Bhagat Singh,Chandrashekhar Azad,Rajguru,Sukhdev and others that they all were Hindu extremists while the fact is none of them was a Hindu extremist, Vaidya said,adding that there was nothing to suggest that the Hindutva leaders participated in freedom movement. 
Higher charge for lawyers <\b>
Even as the cost of living is rising with ever-increasing prices of commodities,the price to be a lawyer and practice law has also increased in Gujarat and that too by 1,000 %. Recently,the Bar Council of Gujarat decided to increase the enrolment fee for the lawyers under the provisions of Advocates Act from Rs 600 to Rs 6,000. The BCG officials said that the fee had not been increased for quite some time and looking at present circumstances it was unanimously decided in a General Meeting of BCG to increase the enrolment fee from Rs 600 to Rs 6,000 for anybody who wanted to practice law from November 1 onwards.

According to the official figures, 29,32,220 tourists visited the statue located in Kevadia colony between November 1, 2018 and November 10, 2019. The total income generated so far is Rs 80.65 crore.

“Average number of tourists who visited the site per day during Diwali holidays is 22,434 as against 14,918 during last year’s Diwali. Thus, the number of tourists per day has increased by 50.4% due to addition of various newly developed tourist attractions.”

The MEA statement announcing cancellation of talks between the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers on September 26, within a day of confirming the meeting, is intriguing. The blunt announcement had undiplomatic phrases and even an inaccuracy. (It claimed that Imran Khan had been in office for a ‘few months’, when it had only been a month since he took over.) The wording so mortified former IFS officer Sharat Sabharwal that he tweeted in defence of his service. “IFS does not draft such election oriented statements or take such hasty flip flop decisions,” he said, adding that the thinking behind the statement was “more brawn than brain’’. Since MEA officials and the PMO claim privately that they did not compose the statement, the question is, who did so and why? It appears that the press release was written in a huff and a hurry after National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval reportedly expressed his reservations over the talks, even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi is believed to have okayed the meeting in principle. Doval is understood to have objected because he feared that Pakistan’s hawkish Foreign Minister S M Qureshi, who is known to have humiliated India in public in the past, was unlikely to be constructive.
Will Doval lose beat?
During former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s regime and even after he demitted office, Indo-Pakistan negotiations were conducted from the Indian side largely by NSA Doval, who kept in regular touch with his Pakistani counterpart through meetings, often in third countries, and even telephonic conversations. However, Doval could now be out of the picture since Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has not appointed a National Security Adviser and, in fact, has decided to shut down the division.
Weeding out Congress
Just as Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy was trying his best to mollify former CM Siddaramaiah and other Congress dissidents, the lone BSP minister in the government, N Mahesh, has struck a discordant note. Mahesh, while inaugurating a cleanliness drive, urged people to uproot the Congress, describing the party as a weed. Congress minister Puttaranga Shetty, who has an ongoing feud with Mahesh as they are both from the same region, fumed, “Who is Mahesh to talk of removing the Congress?’’https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Mahesh tried to explain away his comments, claiming that he was actually referring to the Parthenium weed, which is commonly known as Congress grass and is believed to have come to India in the 1960s through wheat sacks imported from the USA under the PL-480 Food for Peace programme. His smart response appears incredulous. Mahesh, a Dalit who is Karnataka’s reform-minded primary and secondary education minister, is among the most erudite of ministers in Kumaraswamy’s Cabinet.
Bronzed Iron Man
The Iron Man of India will be covered in bronze cladding made in China. The giant statue of Sardar Patel coming up in Gujarat, costing around Rs 2,300 crore, will measure 182 metres from head to foot and 240 metres if one includes the base. The Statue of Unity, as it is called, will be twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. True, it is not entirely a Made in India product, but the iron for the statue and most of the inputs are indigenous. Experts from the US, Singapore and other countries were hired to advise on environmental safety, architectural details and to plan a digital museum for Patel. A high-speed lift will take visitors to the top and offer a panoramic view of the mighty Narmada river, the dam and the surrounding peaks. It is expected to be one of India’s major tourist attractions and state governments have been invited to build guesthouses in the vicinity. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was the first to send a blank cheque for his state’s guest house.
Bureaucratic sloth
Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is keen for the new school of journalism he has opened in his country to have a tie-up with the Indian Institute of Mass Communication. In fact, the country’s Ambassador to India, Farhad Arziev, is an alumnus of IIMC. The proposal was sent to the Indian government several months ago, but to the embarrassment of the MEA, when President Mirziyoyev arrived in Delhi last week, the MoU with IIMC could not be signed. IIMC Director K G Suresh says the delay is because the new executive council of IIMC has yet to meet to clear the proposal. Considering the term of the last executive ended three months ago, there was surely sufficient time for a new executive to be constituted and for a meeting to be called."

(File)
The state government is considering a special status for Kevadia Colony, which has turned into a tourist hub after the inauguration of the Statue of Unity (SoU) — the 182-meter statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — in order to ensure better management of increased civic needs of the area.
With as many as 30 peripheral projects set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31 at SoU’s first anniversary, the administration has felt the need to separate Kevadia from the Gram Panchayat.
According to senior government officials, Gram Panchayat of Limdi, under which Kevadia Colony falls, is not equipped to handle the newfound civic needs of the area. Chief Secretary JN Singh told The Indian Express that the government is working at permutations to make Kevadia a special zone for administrative purposes. Singh said, “The Gram Panchayat is unable to cope with the administrative needs of Kevadia Colony. We are working on making it a special zone in order to make things easier… something along the lines of Tirupati. Not just Kevadia, but a similar model is being worked out for Ambaji and other places.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to officials of the Narmada district administration where Kevadia falls, the need for a separate administration has been felt after the area’s fast-paced development and an increased inflow of tourists. IK Patel, District Collector of Narmada and CEO of SoU, said, “Basic civic needs like sanitation and water supply to Kevadia Colony are not something that the Gram Panchayat can handle anymore. The government will soon decide the best possible way to create a separate body that can administer Kevadia Colony, which is currently under the Panchayat and therefore, the Deputy Collector.”
Sources said that Somnath could also be considered as a special zone for administrative purposes. An official said, “A corporation like those being created for smart cities could be on cards for tourist areas like Kevadia Colony and Ambaji, which will have the power to execute civic projects and the funds needed for the same. A body is needed to manage the funds meant for the development of civic amenities to ensure accountability and transparency.”
Meanwhile, Kevadia Colony is preparing for grand celebrations for the first anniversary of the statue on October 31, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. While Modi visited Kevadia on his birthday on September 17, to pay obeisance to river Narmada after the Sardar Sarovar dam had touched its Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 138.68 metres, it will be Shah’s first visit to Kevadia since taking oath as the Home Minister.
Among the special events lined up for the day — which is to be celebrated as ‘Ekta Divas’ across the country — is a parade by the Central Police Reserve Forces (CRPF) and the National Security Guard (NSG) commandos. According to insiders, much of the celebrations will be themed around the recent abrogation of Article 370 from Kashmir, as well as the creation of the Union Territory. Officials say that a special mention of Sardar Patel’s vision for a unified India and the then incomplete task of Kashmir will also be part of the narrative.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Modi will also inaugurate Nutrition Park, Safari Park, Mirror Maze, Kevadia Railway station, Vishwa Van, Cactus Garden, Dinosaur park, Ekta Nursery, Arogya Van, Aquarium, Butterfly Garden, Shreshta Bharat Bhavan, Narmada Nihar and Ekta Dwar. While the Ekta Dwar has already been erected, speculations are rife that Kevadia will also be rechristened Ekta Nagri on October 31. IK Patel, however, denied it."

“The problem with the Gujarat Chief Minister is that he is back to very,very cheap antics… There cannot be absolutely any objection to installing the statue of Patel,but the context has to be taken into account,” party spokesman Manish Tewari told reporters.
Gujarat Congress has complained to the state Election Commission accusing Modi of breaching the poll code while Modi dubbed the action as an “insult” to Patel. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tewari said if the Gujarat Chief Minister was so serious to honour India’s first Home Minister,he would have contributed to the renovation of Patel’s memorial in Ahmedabad.
“There has been no such contribution for the past nine years,” he claimed.
Tewari alleged that Modi’s announcement of erecting the statue just ahead of elections to six municipal corporations was to garner votes for the BJP. “His intention is to gain cheap popularity and score brownie points.”
A couple of days back,Modi had announced erection of 182 feet tall statue of Sardar Patel called ‘Statue of Unity’ at Sadhu Bet,an island on River Narmada,which will be double the height of ‘Statue of Liberty’."

On the eve of the unveiling of the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya Colony, as many as 16 tribal activists and leaders were detained by police from various villages across Narmada district on Tuesday for “planning to hold protests” during the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Wednesday.
In neighbouring Tapi district, at least 10 tribal activists from Vyara tonsured their heads as a mark of support to the protest call ahead of the inauguration of the 182-metre-tall statue.
Those detained on Tuesday belonged to Bhilistan Tiger Sena (BTS), an organisation floated by Jhagadia MLA Chhotu Vasava, and Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) party formed by his son Mahesh Vasava in 2017. Among those detained were BTS district president Mahesh Gagubhai Vasava and district vice-president Mahendra Vasava, besides members of the two outfits.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

(Source: Twitter)
Rohit Prajapati, Nita Vidrohi, Modita Vidrohi — daughters of late Gandhian Chuni Vaidya — were also detained. According to the police, the BTS and BTP leaders were mobilising people to join protests through social media. Police said they detained the tribals leaders and their functionaries as a preventive measure.
“We are not against Sardar Patel, but we are against the BJP government in the state which has snatched the rights of tribals in Gujarat. Our demand is that government should implement Article 244 (1) of the Constitution, and then inaugurate the Statue of Unity,” Chhotu Vasava told reporters in Surat as he, accompanied by his son Mahesh Vasava and Congress MLAs from Vyara and Mandvi — Punaji Gamit and Anand Chaudhary —opposed the unveiling ceremony of the Rs 3,000-crore statue.
“We just want to ask how tribals could benefit from the Statue of Unity. The government should come out with clear picture. We have been protesting for long, as a result of which we are getting support from a large number of tribals across the state,” Chhotu Vasava added.
The state government has been claiming that the Statue of Unity project would generate jobs for tribals in the regions as the project is likely to attract a large number of tourists. On Monday, the government said that local youths from the tribal-dominated districts in the region have been trained to work as guides at the statue site.
This comes amidst headmen of 22 villages located near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on Monday wrote an open letter to PM Narendra Modi, stating that villagers would not welcome him at the inauguration of the Statue of Unity on October 31.
Local tribal leaders have also announced a boycott of the function citing destruction of natural resources due to the memorial. “These forests, rivers, waterfalls, land and agriculture supported us for generations. We survived on them. But, everything is being destroyed now and celebrations are also planned. Don’t you think its akin to celebrating someone’s death? We feel so,” the letter, having common content and signed by sarpanchs of 22 villages, stated.
“The tribals will observe inauguration of the Statue of Unity as “Black Day”, and tribals in each and every village in Gujarat will not cook food and they will keep fast for one day. The protest will not be for single day. We have planned in detail and it will continue for few more days. We are also protesting against water issues in the tribal-dominated areas. There has been no solution from the state government,” the former MP added.
His son, Mahesh Vasava, said that they will hold a tribal rally from Umargam taluka in Valsad district to different parts of the tribal-dominated districts, talukas and villages across the state for 21 days.
The Congress MLA from Mandvi in Surat, Anand Chaudhary, also hit out at the government for neglecting the tribals and spending money on building the statue. “In the name of development in tribal areas, the rights of tribals are being snatched away. For all these years, tribals have been victims, as a result of which tribals are protesting against the Statue of Unity. We are demanding our rights from the government and to pressure the government, which is terming us as Naxals and traitors,” Chaudhary said.
“The protest by the tribals across the state should be done peacefully and nobody will take law in their hands,” the MLA added. The tribal belt from Umargaam to Ambaji, comprising 5,500 villages and various tribal organisations, have called for a bandh on Wednesday."

The US presidential results were unlike anything candidate Joe Biden and the Democrats have hoped. They weren’t an overwhelming repudiation of President Donald Trump and his policies. The race, instead, turned into a nail-biter with no clear winner emerging even more than 24 hours after polling ended. Key battleground states, however, began to slowly turn Blue as counting progressed, narrowing down Trump’s path to the White House. Track all the latest updates here.
Meanwhile, inside a bar in Pennsylvania, not far from Biden’s home, local residents keenly followed the results on TV as the evening turned to night.

Decision 2020
The RJD might be making a serious effort to woo voters outsider its Muslim-Yadav base, but the spectre of “jungle raj” still weighs heavily on the minds of upper castes and non-Yadav OBC’s, EBCs and Mahadalits. The voter who is looking for change is searching for an “Arvind Kejriwal-type” option, a “teesri vikalp” — a (third) alternative with a clean slate.
As the Mahagathbandhan takes heart from the crowds flocking to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s rallies, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is banking on his “silent voters” — women and EBCs. The Nitish government has assiduously courted both, and believe that though not as vocal or visible as the others and hence not registering in the various poll analyses, they continue to stand by it.

The police is probing a complaint, filed by the manager of a Vadodara branch of HDFC Bank at Kevadia police station, for the alleged siphoning off of the money during the period between October 2018 and March 2020.
Himkar Singh, Superintendent of Police (SP), Narmada District, confirmed to The Indian Express that two staff members of the collection company had been detained for questioning.
“We are questioning them for their role in the theft. They are collection agents, who visited the Statue of Unity multiple times during the period when the said crime took place… If there is evidence of their involvement in the theft, they will be arrested. The MoU between the bank and Writers Business anyway lays the onus on the latter, which has certain security amount deposited with HDFC. So Writer Business will foot the bill of this theft,” the SP said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The complaint filed late on November 30 said that the bank has engaged Writer Business for offering doorstep cash collection facility to the Statue of Unity, which had offline ticket counters before the Covid-19 lockdown for entry to various projects of the tourist spot as well as regular parking charges.
The HDFC Bank has been providing services for the cash collected daily by the SoU administration at various counters for offline ticketing and parking fees, and depositing it in the Statue of Unity bank account in its Vadodara branch. The receipt of the cash received is issued to the SoU administration and it is periodically reconciled with the cash deposit entries made in the account.
During the reconciliation carried out with the HDFC after the easing of Covid-19 curbs, SoU auditors noticed that the receipts submitted by executives of Writer Business on behalf of the bank did not match with the actual entries into the account with an amount of Rs 5.25 crore missing.
An officer of the district police said, “We have to tally a lot of records to ascertain the exact days when the theft has taken place as the period ranges from October 2018 to March 2020.” The receipts in the SoU records indicated that the agent of the HDFC Bank had been handed over the amount.
Singh added, “There is also negligence on part of the bank and the local administration. Such kind of checks on daily cash collections should be done regularly, if not every day…”
According to Narmada District Collector DA Shah, who is also the CEO of SoU, HDFC Bank is solely responsible for this transaction process. A committee that met and scrutinised the records concluded that the theft occurred between the two financial companies and, as per the agreement, HDFC Bank has credited the amount to the SoU account along with the interest, while they will resolve their dispute with their agent.
The FIR, so far, mentions “Staff of Writers Business Services Private Ltd”, as the accused and has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) 407 (criminal breach of trust by carrier), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy).

Railway officials said the trains were running despite losses as only a handful of passengers booked tickets compared to the capacity of both the trains. 
“The trains were making severe loss. We had eight coaches in the Memu train between Pratapnagar to Kevadia and the Janshatabdi has one vista dome coach and around six coaches. There have been no commuters right since the beginning.

Meena added that while the railways observed low occupancy even when the trains were flagged off in January, the first step was to reduce the size of the trains.

“For the Memu, we first reduced the frequency from three daily round trips to one round trip per day. Then we reduced the number of coaches from eight to four. But there were days and trips in which only two passengers travelled. This is unsustainable at the moment. We believe that owing to the  pandemic, there are barely any commuters… For the moment, we have suspended the train until a further decision is taken.”"

Modi, who landed in Ahmedabad late Tuesday, is also scheduled to visit the Wall of Unity, built with soil collected from more than 1 lakh villages across the country in 2013-14. The Prime Minister will perform a special prayer at the feet of the Statue of Unity and visit the museum and exhibition, and the viewers’ gallery. The gallery, at 153 metres, can accommodate up to 200 people at a time and offers a spectacular view of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, its reservoir, and the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges.

A tent city and the state bhavans are two new features added to the project since its inception —- the bhavans will be built by some state governments, on the Gujarat government’s invitation, with Uttar Pradesh and Nagaland having already accepted the proposal.

The statue was conceptualised by Modi when he was Gujarat Chief Minister. Its foundation was laid in October 2013.

"1618504956-999","https://indianexpress.com/page/35/?s=%22Statue+of+unity%22","Fallout: Narendra Modi BJP’s No.1 but others may begin talking back","https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/fallout-narendra-modi-bjps-no-1-but-others-may-begin-talking-back/","Fallout: Narendra Modi BJP’s No.1 but others may begin talking back","December 9, 2013 3:26:10 am","The Bharatiya Janata Partys victory in the last set of state polls before next years general elections has strengthened the position of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi at the partys pinnacle but its also likely to prompt factions within to redraw their boundaries as they deal with a more charged-up Modi.
In fact,the 4-0 scoreline  although the Delhi verdict is still wide open  can help delay a wave of simmering protests. But for Modi-baiters,the Aam Aadmi Party stealing its thunder in Delhi and Shivraj Singh Chouhan naming L K Advani before Modi in the list of credits during his victory speech has come as fresh fodder. Their differences with Modi are expected to get sharper given his authoritative style and reluctance to accommodate beyond set terms. 
Even one of his ardent backers,BJP president Rajnath Singh,is up against one such issue. Singh,a leader from Uttar Pradesh,has always contested from that state but since Amit Shahs appointment as in-charge,the unstated effort has been to find a seat for Modi to contest from Uttar Pradesh  a move seen as a force-multiplier for the BJPs prospects in the state. Singh,sources said,does not feel it is appropriate for both the party president and the partys PM candidate to contest from UP. According to reliable sources,Amit Shah recently conveyed to Singh that Modi,too,agrees with this view without spelling out what exactly does Modi want: to yield to Rajnath or to get Rajnath to back down. This ambiguity,sources said,is causing concern in sections of the party.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As of today,however,Singh recognised Modis role,praising him after he credited victory to all CM candidates and state-level party workers. BJP has won over 405 Assembly seats from 589 Assembly segments that went to polls. This amounts to an approximately 69 percent victory. This is a clear message for 2014 Lok Sabha elections. We have benefited hugely from Narendra Modis popularity.
Another cause for heartburn among his detractors in Delhi is the way Modi deals with them on a strict need-to-know basis. Take the political row over the alleged illegal snooping of a woman by the Gujarat police where Shah,then a Minister,is allegedly on tape instructing an IPS officer at the behest of saheb, an apparent reference to Modi.
When news of this broke,few details were forthcoming from Gandhinagar to BJP leaders. A statement from the womans father was all that BJPs spokespersons in Delhi had to defend their PM candidate. Some senior leaders,who had opposed Modis declaration as PMs candidate,are said to have expressed their view that this went against the BJPs well-established norms of internal democracy.
Even todays victory,while dealing a heavy blow to the Congress ahead of 2014 elections,also threatens to eclipse BJP stalwarts in Parliament. It will be a lame duck Congress government and lame duck Leaders of Opposition, remarked a senior BJP functionary on the impact of BJPs sweep in the Assembly elections.
Further,insiders highlighted the way in which Modi set the terms of engagement with the Government on the  Communal Violence Bill. Despite substantial dilution of its provisions,sources added,there was no way the BJP in Parliament could even consider talking to the government after Modis firm opposition to the Bill.
Even on organisational issues,Modi,it appears,has been passing directions that the party has to execute without question. For example,more recently,the BJP president had to instruct all party general secretaries to help organise Run for Unity on December 15,an initiative of the Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG),a non-proft closely linked to Modi which hosted the Gujarat CM at a youth conclave in October.
The party top brass were clueless about this initiative but have now been asked to chip in as per Modis directions. CAG,incidentally has also described itself as  National Movement Partners for the Statue of Unity movement that aims to instal the worlds tallest statue,that of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,seen as Modis effort to appropriate Patels legacy from the Congress.
Thats not all. Differences within surfaced during the Delhi campaign,too. For about a month before the polls,all campaign material focused on Modi,including radio advertisements which only had Modi speaking. This did create issues in the party,sources said,given that Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj also sees herself as a key Delhi leader. Then,in the last 10 days of the campaign,advertisements with a message from her started appearing. Soon after,there were Arun Jaitley advertisements followed by Rajnath Singhs. Similarly,the manifesto cover had to be re-designed to include more faces,including that of Swaraj.
Incidentally,Swaraj avoided any reference to Modi today. In her tweet after the results,she said: It is a pro BJP wave in Madhya Pradesh,Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and anti-Congress wave in Delhi. She congratulated Chouhan,Raman Singh,Vasundhara Raje and party colleagues.
The move to bring back former BJP stalwart in Karnataka B S Yeddyurappa through a merger with the Karnataka Janata Paksha has been facing resistance from senior members including Advani and Swaraj. The Aam Aadmi Partys stellar debut in Delhi may now be used as an argument against this merger,said sources."

(Express photo)
As the delegates attending the 13th Conference of Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP13) went on an excursion to the Statue of Unity on Friday, the Gujarat Forest Department invited school students to visit an exhibition inside the Indian pavilion at Mahatma Mandir, the venue of the CMS COP13 in Gandinagar.
“Since no formal meetings were scheduled today, we sought permission of the UN (CMS) to allow school students to visit the exhibition so that they can learn about the biodiversity in India and the need to conserve it. We invited the principals of 62 local schools and around 25 schools brought their students to Mahatma Mandir. In all, 732 students and 204 teachers visited the exhibition,” said Dinesh Kumar Sharma, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force in Gujarat.
The forest departments of various states, NGOs and institutes researching and working in the field of biodiversity conservation and companies such as the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, have set up their stalls at the exhibition. A total of 61 stalls display various exhibits, replicas of birds and animals, books and other material on wildlife and conservation efforts by government and various agencies.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We also organised a quiz competition… The objective was to help students learn about our flora and fauna,” added Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Research & Training), Sanjiv Tyagi.
Incidentally, the Gujarat Forest Department has been tasked with making local arrangements for the global event on migratory species of wild animals, which India is hosting for the first time. While the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is hosting the event, arrangements at Mahatma Mandir have been put in place by the state forest department under the MoEFCC’s guidance. “We were preparing for the event for the past several months and it is satisfying that it is going smoothly, without any complaint of mishaps so far,” Sharma added."

“We should feel proud of our farmers, our kisan…In spite of so many negatives happening during the corona (virus pandemic), one sector which has withstood (Covid-19) and then provided a record production of foodgrains, that is the agriculture sector. Doctor, nurse, sanitation workers, security personnel are frontline warriors, no doubt, but first among them are the farmers. Farmers are the most frontline warriors, because they’re annadatas (food-providers) and have increased production even in these trying times,” said Naidu. Naidu, was the chief guest at the closing ceremony of the 386-kilometre commemorative Dandi March, which was initiated to launch the celebration of 75 years of Independence – Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav.
The march was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 12 from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The vice-president had taken a tour of Prarthna Mandir, followed by a tour of Saifee Villa, where MK Gandhi had stayed a night during the Dandi March in 1930. Naidu visited the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial (NSSM). The tour ended with Naidu signing the visitor’s book at the NSSM. Naidu was gifted a framed replica of a wall painting of the march at the NSSM by MSU, Baroda alumnus Alexander Devasia.
Meanwhile, hailing the initiative of a commemorative Dandi March, Naidu added, “It is more remarkable that the Dandi March we’re symbolically rebuilding today signifies the nation’s ability to stand united… I’m very happy that our Prime Minister when he takes up any issue, he makes it memorable, he makes it historical. Take the case of Statue of Unity, take the case of Ambedkar memorial in Delhi…”
Also present at the event and on the dais were Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, deputy CM Nitin Patel, Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang, Union Minister of State for Culture and Tourism, Prahlad Singh Patel and Navsari MP CR Paatil.
Notably, the last 12 kilometre stretch of the Dandi March saw 45 school students from Gangtok, studying in classes 10 and 12, join in. The Sikkim CM too had joined in on the march. As Lakshman Adhikary, one of the four escorts who were accompanying the students for the march from Gangtok, said, “Over 120 people from Sikkim participated in the march here which included the Sikkim CM, political leaders, bureaucrats and students. We were informed in very short notice (by the central government) so the education department overnight gathered names of students who were athletes from around eight schools in Gangtok. They had to be then tested for Covid-19 and flown in by April 2 and participate in the march by April 3.”
CM Tamang said that the “andolan” of Dandi March of 1930 till date inspires all to fight against injustice, which is an ideal of a democracy but “the way Indian jawans were martyred in Chhattisgarh by Naxalites, while expressing condolences, I also condemn the anti-nationals in strong words,” added Tamang.
‘Make in India’, ‘Vocal for Local’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ found unanimous mention among all dais-speakers, with special praise reserved for the ‘Make in India’ vaccine (Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR).
Rupani, who reminisced on how a public-driven movement in 1930 that involved taking a pinch of salt had caused havoc in the colonial powers’ ranks, added that it is a matter of pride that Azadi Amrit Mahotsav, to mark 75 years of independence, started from Gujarat “at the hands of Gujarat’s son and Prime minister Narendrabhai Modi.”
“On the direction of the Centre, which is that of the PM Narendrabhai, a self-righteous (swabhimaan), a self-belief (aatmavishwas) has developed among citizens… we’ll live for this country and we’ll die for this country… In the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working with the feeling that Corona loses, India wins…”"

Noted Gujarati folk singer Gita Rabari who was among the guests riding the vistadome coach commended Modi for turning Kevadia into a tourist spot. She said, “I have never been to Statue of Unity and am excited to visit it today.”
The inaugural ride had coaches allotted for religious leaders, industrialists, people from rural areas, school students, sportspersons, media persons, cadets of NCC and NSS, and travel agents.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Eight members of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s family also boarded the train at Anand railway station.
Bhupendra Patel, grandson of Sardar Patel’s youngest brother, Kashibhai Patel, who lives in Vallabh Vidyanagar, has been taking guests to the SoU. “ I usually take them by road. This train has made it much easier. People from any part of the country can reach this place without any transportation issues,” he told this paper.
Atul Patel, another relative of Sardar Patel, who lives in Vadodara, said, “With the construction of SoU and this train service, Kevadia has got chance to be in the limelight as a tourist destination. The best thing is that this train service was made possible in 20 months.”
Kevadia, nestled in the Vindhya mountains and home to the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river, has been popular as a picnic spot for schoolchildren.
The Vistadome coach that would cost Rs 885 per seat, had 44 passengers, including Padma awardee Vishnu Pandya, who is the chairperson of the Gujarat Sahitya Akademi, and has helped provide content for the Sardar museum at the SoU.
Around 25 students of Sanskrit Gurukul Vidyalay from Asarva area of Ahmedabad chanted slokas and folk dancers performed as the marigold bedecked train left Ahmedabad, with a total 14 coaches with a capacity of1,276 persons.
On Sunday, 885 people took the inaugural ride through cotton, plantain and castor fields, in the Charotar region of central Gujarat into the forested and tribal district of Narmada, covering 180 kms at a speed of nearly 110kmph, close to the time taken by a road trip. The train was welcomed by local people at Nadiad, Anand, Vadodara, Dabhoi and Chandod. The train is scheduled to make daily trips from Ahmedabad to Kevadia and back.
Parth Vataliya, a school student from Sarkhej area of Ahmedabad, said, “I am visiting the SoU for the first time and very excited about it. I loved this journey as we have been served nice food and the train is very clean.”
Chief priest of Jagannath Mandir in Ahmedabad, Mahant Dilipdas Maharaj, was thankful to Modi for inviting the “sant samaj” on the first ride, and said, “My blessings are there for the efforts of PM Narendrabhai Modi who has started this train which is going to benefit a lot of people.”
congratulating Modi, Akhileshwardas Maharaj from Ahmedabad said, “What PM Modiji is doing will benefit immensely to the country economically and vocationally. It will also help people understand what Sardar Patel had done for Somnath temple and for Dharm.”
Former deputy municipal commissioner of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, ZA Sacha, drew attention, wearing a thobe and keffiyeh (Arabic attire).
According to Sacha, “Through such initiatives, people come closer to each other. They get a chance to know each other. Also, with this service, people can reach Kevadia easily and see Statue of Unity. They will be able to enjoy our rich culture.”
Joel Christian, an evangelist from the Church of North India, Gujarat Diocese, said, “It is our utter privilege that we are representing Christian community and grateful to PM Modi and CM (Rupani) for witnessing this historic moment of diversity.”

The group of industrialists that took the train included Shilpa Bhatt, chairperson of Business Woman Wing Committee of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Two other business women travelling with her included Swapna Sai and Sarangi Kanani.
“Earlier, one could reach Kevadia only by road. Now people have another option… Train journey is very comfortable compared to road journey, which is tiresome. Today’s development will change the direction of tourism in Gujarat. It will also inspire other states,” they said.
At Kevadia, where Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was present, the special invitees were taken on a tour of the 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel, the Jungle Safari and the Children Nutrition Park.
Commercial operations of the train starts from Monday with ticket price ranging between Rs 120 and Rs 885.

Modi also attacked the Prime Minister on the issue of installing a gate on the Sardar Sarovar Dam which has been pending for a long time. He alleged that Gujarat is being discriminated against by the Centre for political reasons.
Taking on the Prime Minister for his comments on October 29 that he is proud Patel belonged to his party,Modi said,”Rana Pratap,Chhatrapati Shivaji,Bhagat Singh,Sukhdev,Rajguru are highly respected. Were they BJP members? Will only those who belong to the BJP be given respect and honour. Country is greater than the party and those who sacrifice themselves for the country are greater.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He emphasised that nobody,not even him,can deny that Patel belonged to a party but his stature was such that he is respected by all. “We should not divide our legacy,” Modi said.
BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate,who was speaking at the inauguration of a project to build the tallest statue of Sardar Patel here,also attacked Singh and the Congress on the issue of secularism.
“I would really like to honour the Prime Minister for saying that Patel was truly secular. We also say that Patel was truly secular. 
The country needs Patel’s secularism and not votebank secularism. He was secular yet his secularism did not come in the way of building the Somnath Temple. Mr Prime Minister,the country needs secularism that does not divide the country but unites it,” Modi said.
The BJP leader alleged that despite repeated requests to the Prime Minister,the gates on Sardar Sarovar Dam have not been constructed. Indicating that this was due to politics and discrimination against Gujarat,Modi said the Centre and the Congress can take all the credit for it but should build the gate without any further delay."

The service, run by the SpiceJet under the banner of Spice Shuttle, will be resumed after the seaplane returns to India by December 15, officials said.
On Saturday, the seaplane took off for Male in the Maldives, where it is set to undergo “major maintenance” at a hanger in an aerodrome facility, Gujarat government officials said.
This is the second time since its inauguration on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the seaplane service has been suspended for maintenance. The first “routine maintenance” of the aircraft was carried out three days after its inauguration when the services were suspended for two days.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Captain Ajay Chauhan, the Director of Civil Aviation, Government of Gujarat, told The Sunday Express the seaplane had to be sent to the Maldives as it is registered in that country and because India does not yet have a hangar facility for maintenance of seaplanes.
“The seaplane has to mandatorily undergo maintenance at various levels, depending on its flying hours and distance covered. This is a major maintenance and occurs after every stipulated flying hours. Since its arrival, the seaplane has flown for a significant number of hours, including its journey to reach India,” Chauhan said.
He added this kind of major maintenance needed to be carried out in a hangar “but we do not have a hangar for seaplanes right now in India. The seaplanes cannot land on runways meant for regular flights, so it cannot be taken to the Ahmedabad airport for maintenance”.
Chauhan said the seaplane service would commence immediately after the plane returned to India by December 15. “Currently, the SpiceJet has wet-leased the 19-seater Twin Otter 300 seaplane from Maldivian Aero. Under the agreement, the Maldives provides SpiceJet with the entire service, insurance, operations and maintenance as well as crew in lieu of a fee. Carrying out maintenance of a flight also has to adhere to some guidelines of the Director-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) but for that, the aircraft has to be registered in India, which is not the case with this seaplane,” he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
An executive of the SpiceJet said such routine maintenance was necessary for the “smooth functioning” of the seaplane services and a hangar to carry out maintenance of the seaplane would soon be ready in Ahmedabad."

Gujarat MLA and tribal leader Chhotu Vasava has put up a series of Facebook posts explaining the significance of Diwali for tribal communities. Vasava, who has been vehemently opposed to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, has used the ‘Statue of displacement’ and ‘Aarey’ hashtags in his posts to mention the “injustice” being done to tribals who have lost their lands to development projects. Vasava, in his post said that Diwali holds a different significance for tribals as compared to the Hindu community. “We tribals do not celebrate Diwali based on the panchang and tithi dates but by way of the decision of the village chief, who sends the village chowkidar to each home to announce the dates of Diwali. It usually comes in between the season of the rabi harvest and the kharif sowing because Diwali is associated with crops for tribals where we worship the dhan (crops) and the cows.” Explaining the four-day tribal ritual of harvesting the food, worshipping the cows, farm tools and the sun, Vasava has expressed hope for ‘justice for the innocent adivasis’ during Diwali.
Marked For Minister
Several minutes before Union Minister Amit Shah was set to arrive at Sola Civil Hospital to interact with Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries, hospital and government personnel were seen marking chairs with a blue ribbon and seating handpicked beneficiaries in the marked chairs. The interaction seemed to have been decided impromptu, and announced just hours before it was to begin. Approximately 15 such chairs were marked of the odd 80-90 chairs at the venue. Officials undertaking this task were seen asking those already seated on the marked chairs to move to another one. The same list was handed out to the minister for his interaction and the names of beneficiaries seated on the marked chairs were called out to share their experiences. Some other names too were called but the beneficiaries were absent. No beneficiary from the unmarked chairs was called out."

Former Gujarat Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela Sunday said Manmohan Singh was the “world’s best prime minister” who worked hard for the country without seeking publicity.
In a veiled attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vaghela accused him of “wasting” public money on the Statue of Unity and for “self-advertisement”, and sought Rs 10,000 crore aid for welfare of the OBC community.
“This (Central) government allocated only Rs 1800 crore for welfare of the entire OBC community (in 2018-19). What does that mean? You waste more than Rs 5000 crore in advertisements. Why not give it to the community?” Vaghela asked while addressing an OBC Sammelan at Fagvel in Kheda district, around 38 kms from here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Questionning priorities of the Modi government, Vaghela said the ruling dispensation spent “Rs 10,000 crore” on the construction of the Statue of Unity and Mahatma Mandir (a convention hall in the state capital Gandhinagar) even as “people are dying of hunger, farmers committing suicide, and youths becoming jobless”.
“…The government should give Rs 10,000 crore for the welfare of the OBC community,” he said.
The Statue of Unity, which is the tallest monument in the world dedicated to first Union Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was unveiled by the prime minister in Gujarat’s Narmada district in October this year.
Referring to Bollywood film “The Accidental Prime Minister,” Vaghela, who had quit Congress ahead of 2017 Gujarat assembly polls, said Manmohan Singh was “the best prime minister in the world.
“Manmohan Singh saved the country from recession for ten years. He did not work to get his photos published, or deliver speeches. You are silent, not him. His work spoke for himself,” he said in an apparent reference to Modi’s criticism of Singh as “mauni baba” or a silent premier.
“The Accidental Prime Minister” is a biographical film based on the 2014 memoir of the same name by Sanjaya Baru, the then media adviser to Manmohan Singh.
Singh, who headed the erstwhile UPA government, served as the 13th PM of the country who remained in office from May 22, 2004 to May 26, 2014.
The Congress has said the film is the BJP’s propaganda against the Grand Old Party.
Without naming Modi, Vaghela asked him to give account of the works done by his government after coming to power in 2014.
“They gave you power for five years to work. But you have made fun of people. The entire country is finished. The country has gone backward by 15 years (due to demonetisation and GST),” he said.
There is nobody who understands the economy in the Central government. What has it got to do with us whether your plane lands in the Sabarmati (river) or in the ocean? We should not fall for such “dramabazi”, he said.
The prime minister had taken a seaplane flight from the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad to the Dharoi dam in Mehsana district on the last day of campaigning for Gujarat polls last year, triggering a row."

The iron collected over two years for the Statue of Unity project-a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to be built in Vadodara facing the Narmada Dam-is likely to be part of an art work to be displayed there, and unlikely to be used in the main structure of the statue, say officials associated with the project. This has come in sharp contrast to the original plan of the project.
In fact, the official website, http://www.statueofunity says: “The iron collected through the ‘Loha’ campaign will be melted, converted into rebar, and used in the foundation of the Statue of Unity, making farmers across India an integral part of building the World’s Tallest Statue.”
[related-post]
KV Sanghavi, Chief Engineer, Project Director & Director (Canals) for Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), said that though the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) is yet to take a decision on how the metal could be used, the sentimental value attached to the drive could result in a separate display art work.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are not going to use the iron for the main structure as we are not very sure about its quality. If we use it, a lot of technical process will have to be done. It is more a sentiment-related issue and we will be using it in the non-structural part or for display. We could make an art work or a show piece out of it that can be displayed in the open. What it would be or how it would look, has not been finalised,” Sanghavi told The Indian Express.
The SSNNL has so far collected 1,69,078 kits containing iron tools each weighing nearly 700 grams from across the country, as against the target of three lakh kits of iron tools from farmers’ contributions. The government constituted the SVPRET, chaired by the incumbent chief minister, as the executing body for the statue which is also supported by people’s funding. “The iron tool collection is now complete and we have received no fresh kits since the beginning of this year,” said an officer.
Last year, the Gujarat government had roped in Gujarat State Fertilizers Company (GSFC) and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers (GNFC) – two of its major PSUs to complete its “iron collection drive”.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2377556"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/patel-statue-graphic.jpg"" alt=""patel-statue-graphic"" width=""206"" height=""208"" />The kits containing the iron metal were stocked in the SSNNL godown in Chhani.
Recently, the engineering teams working on the design of the statue conducted a detailed ‘light and shadow’ study to ascertain its “look” at any time of the day or season. According to officials, the study will help to decide the orientation of the statue with respect to the light. The engineering team will also begin wind tunnel tests at the site, after completing the geo-technical and hydrological survey tests.
Sanghavi says that the reinforcement steel for the main structure will be of first quality. “There are many parts of the project for which we can use the steel and even roll it if necessary. Nothing has been planned as of now. Depending upon its metallurgy, things can be added or subtracted from the scrap during the process of extraction,” he said.
A BJP leader said, “The iron collection drive has ensured that farmers across the country know about the statue and feel connected to it. They understand that they are part of the process of the construction of the World’s Tallest statue. The tools will be put to good use by experts.”"

Speaking at the first convocation of St Xavier’s University in Kolkata, he said that education is also needed to resolve disputes through democratic dialogue and effective leadership.
The society takes recourse to the force of education to challenge hate-mongering and divisive agenda, Tharoor, who

About the education system in India, Tharoor, who was a former minister of state for human resource development,

said “we are suffering from the systemic problem of skill mismatch between qualifications and jobs undertaken”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Because of this not knowing what to do after graduation, some politicians will suggest them to make pakodas

(fried snacks),” he said in a veiled reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion that those who sell pakodas outside offices count as employed.
He said, “Our present government will not invest in subsidising scholarships for our best students, preferring to

waste its money on grandiose statues”, an obvious reference to the 182 m tall statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, known as the Statue of Unity in Gujarat which was inaugurated by Modi last year.
“In India we are struggling to provide fair access to motivated students. Last week, the students of Bangalore’s National Law School University who had already paid Rs 1.80 lakh were suddenly told to pay up Rs 50,000 more which for students from economically weaker students were left helpless”, he said.
Tharoor said he was looking forward to the New Education Policy aimed to create a new approach to education in the country."

Addressing 5,000 gram panchayat representatives from 24 states at the National Conference on Panchayati Raj and Rural Development here on Saturday,Modi not only listed his governments achievements but also lauded Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Only a few day ago,Chouhan had showered praises on Modi. Under the Jyotirgam Yojana,all villages in Gujarat get 24 hours electricity supply. Under the Atal Jyoti Yojana,MP is doing the same, said Modi in his inaugural speech at Mahatma Mandir. Last month,the MP government had issued a full page advertisement in a Gujarati newspaper,claiming completion of the Atal Jyoti Yojana.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhis vision of Gram Swarajya,Modi called for efforts to make villages self-sufficient in all spheres,instead of focussing on winning elections through a culture of charity. Calling for strengthening of Gram Sabhas,Modi avowed that the Gram Sabha must be as important for the village as the Lok Sabha is for the nation. He called for the optimum use of technology for enhancing the development of villages. The CM spoke about the importance of de-centralisation in order to develop villages,saying that sitting in state capitals authorities cannot take decisions about the needs of villages. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Felicitating sarpachs who have done remarkable work in their respective villages,Modi claimed that the rural development model of Gujarat is successful due to various innovative projects.
With sarpanchs and councilors from across India present at the venue,Modi promoted his pet project of building Statue of Unity  a 182-feet-high statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel  touted to be the tallest in the world. His idea of collecting iron pieces from all villages of India to build this statue on an island near Sardar Sarovar Dam is being promoted as a farmers movement by the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha election. A short film on the proposed statue was screened ahead of Modis speech.

In fact,the 4-0 scoreline  although the Delhi verdict is still wide open  can help delay a wave of simmering protests but for Modi-baiters in the party,the Aam Aadmi Party stealing its thunder in Delhi and Shivraj Singh Chouhan naming L K Advani before Modi in the list of credits during his victory speech has come as fresh fodder. Their differences with Modi are expected to get sharper given his authoritative style and reluctance to accommodate beyond set terms. 
Even one of his ardent backers,BJP president Rajnath Singh,is up against one such issue. Singh,a leader from Uttar Pradesh,has always contested from that state but since Amit Shahs appointment as UP in-charge,the unstated effort has been to find a seat for Modi to contest from that state (this is seen as a force-multiplier for the BJPs prospects in UP). Singh,sources said,does not feel its appropriate for both the party president and the partys PM candidate to contest from UP.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to reliable sources,Amit Shah recently conveyed to Singh that Modi,too,agrees with this view without spelling out what exactly does Modi want: to yield to Rajnath or to get Rajnath to back down. This ambiguity,sources said,is causing concern in sections of the party.
As of today,however,Singh recognised Modis role,praising him after he credited victory to all CM candidates and state-level party workers. BJP has won over 405 Assembly seats from 589 Assembly segments that went to polls. This amounts to an approximately 69 percent victory. This is a clear message for 2014 Lok Sabha elections. We have benefited hugely from Narendra Modis popularity.
Another cause for heartburn among his detractors in Delhi is the way Modi deals with them on a strict need-to-know basis. Take the political row over the alleged illegal snooping of a woman by the Gujarat police where Shah,then a Minister,is allegedly on tape instructing an IPS officer at the behest of saheb, an apparent reference to Modi.
When news of this broke,few details were forthcoming from Gandhinagar to BJP leaders. A statement from the womans father was all that BJPs spokespersons in Delhi had to defend their PM candidate. Some senior leaders,who had opposed Modis declaration as PMs candidate,are said to have expressed their view that this went against the BJPs well-established norms of internal democracy.
Even todays victory,while dealing a heavy blow to the Congress ahead of 2014 elections,also threatens to eclipse BJP stalwarts in Parliament. It will be a lame duck Congress government and lame duck Leaders of Opposition, remarked a senior BJP functionary on the impact of BJPs sweep in the Assembly elections.
Further,insiders highlighted the way in which Modi set the terms of engagement with the Government on the  Communal Violence Bill. Despite substantial dilution of its provisions,sources added,there was no way the BJP in Parliament could even consider talking to the government after Modis firm opposition to the Bill.
Even on organisational issues,Modi,it appears,has been passing directions that the party has to execute without question. For example,more recently,the BJP president had to instruct all party general secretaries to help organise Run for Unity on December 15,an initiative of the Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG),a non-profit closely linked to Modi which hosted the Gujarat CM at a youth conclave in October.
The party top brass were clueless about this initiative but have now been asked to chip in as per Modis directions. CAG,incidentally has also described itself as  National Movement Partners for the Statue of Unity movement that aims to instal the worlds tallest statue,that of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,seen as Modis effort to appropriate Patels legacy from the Congress.
Thats not all. Differences within surfaced during the Delhi campaign,too. For about a month before the polls,all campaign material focused on Modi,including radio advertisements which only had Modi speaking. This did create issues in the party,sources said,given that Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj also sees herself as a key Delhi leader. Then,in the last 10 days of the campaign,advertisements with a message from her started appearing. Soon after,there were Arun Jaitley advertisements followed by Rajnath Singhs. Similarly,the manifesto cover had to be re-designed to include more faces,including that of Swaraj.
Incidentally,Swaraj avoided any reference to Modi today. In her tweet after the results,she said: It is a pro BJP wave in Madhya Pradesh,Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and anti-Congress wave in Delhi. She congratulated Chouhan,Raman Singh,Vasundhara Raje and party colleagues.
The move to bring back former BJP stalwart in Karnataka B S Yeddyurappa through a merger with the Karnataka Janata Paksha has been facing resistance from senior members including Advani and Swaraj. The Aam Aadmi Partys stellar debut in Delhi may now be used as an argument against this merger,said sources."

As part of the publicity blitzkrieg launched by the Gujarat government to draw crowds to the Statue of Unity is an abridged biography of Sardar Patel that glorifies the leader as doing Mahatma Gandhi’s bidding by sticking around with Jawaharlal Nehru even though their thinking clashed.
The book — Hind na Sardar in Gujarati, Sardar of India in English and Hind ke Sardar in Hindi — originally written by his contemporary Ravjibhai Manibhai Patel in 1962, and published by Gandhian Navjivan Press, is being distributed in the ongoing government-sponsored Ekta Yatra. The book — the government has commissioned 25,000 copies of the book from Navjivan Press — will also be distributed among guests visiting the Statue of Unity in Narmada district.

While the biography covers various aspects of Sardar Patel’s life — his schooldays, his law career, Bardoli Satyagraha, his efforts in unifying the princely states among others — it has a chapter, Conflict of Natures, that describes the differences between him and Nehru after Independence. The book records that after Gandhi’s assassination, Sardar “…spent the next two years as the loyal colleague of Nehru to do his duty by Gandhiji… Yet the differences between Nehru and Sardar were not completely over. And in spite of that their oath of loyalty made them work together continuously. In an intolerable situation, Sardar continued to serve the nation after the death of Bapu, with complete loyalty and respect to Nehru…Time and again, he set aside his differences for smooth working of the nation”.
It goes on to quote Sardar’s October 2, 1950 speech that he made in Indore. “Our leader is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Bapu had appointed him as his successor and had declared it too. All the soldiers of Bapu have the obligation to follow Bapu’s orders in totality. Those who do not follow these orders with their hearts are sinners of God. I am not a disloyal soldier. The position in which I am, I do not think of it at all. I know only this — that I am where Bapu placed me,” Sardar Patel is quoted as saying.
It is to be noted that the book has been ‘re-compiled’ to the extent that it has added a message of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and around 15 pages devoted to the Statue of Unity project.
Managing Trustee of Navjivan Trust Vivek Desai said, “The original content of the book has not been touched at all.”"

He accused the Central government and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of delaying the raising the height of the dam by building gates,which would optimise generation of hydroelectricity and water supply in the states of Gujarat,Rajasthan,Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. 
The Indian Express explains the recent controversy surrounding this dam located at Kevadiya Colony in Narmada district. The Sardar Sarovar Project,executed under the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam ltd (SSNNL),was built at the cost of $ 392.4 billion and every year the Gujarat Government spends Rs 5,000 crore on the project.
What is the current status of the dam and the recent controversy surrounding gates?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited,a state government undertaking,completed raising the dam up to 121.92 metres in 2006,which is 96 per cent of its total concrete structure. And since then,in absence of a go-ahead from Narmada Control Authority (NCA),construction work at dam site in  Kevadia Colony has come to a standstill. NCA was given power by the SC in 2000 to allow raising of height from time to time following clearance from Relief and Rehabilitation sub-group and Environment sub-group. The state Government has asked the NCA to allow installation of spillway piers,which will take dam to full height of 138.62 metres and 30 steel radial gates over Sardar Sarovar Dam. It is the piers and gates that will technically make it a dam,without which it can only be called a causeway. The Gujarat Government is still waiting for the NCA nod to install the gates.
Why does the Narendra Modi government wants to install gates as soon as possible?
The Gujarat Government has already built the required 30 iron gates,but once installed it will take height of this dam covering four major states – Madhya Pradesh,Gujarat,Maharashtra and Rajasthan – to 138.62 metres from current 121.92 and increase water holding capacity by 74 per cent – from 1.27 million acre feet to 4.75 million acre feet – and help irrigate parched areas in Gujarat. In absence of gates,with the dam overflowing for past two monsoons,water goes wasted even as parched lands of Saurashtra and north Gujarat reel under drought. Modi on Thursday also asked permission to install gates. According to him,the installation work will take at least three years.
When the Environment Sub-Committee has given the nod for gates installation and why has the NCA not given the nod so far?
In January this year,Maharashtra submitted its report on action taken on relief and rehabilitation to Relief and Rehabilitation sub-group,while the other two contenders – Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh – did it in 2012. As per the SC directives,the NCA can give a go-ahead only after clearance of both Environment and Relief and Rehabilitation sub-groups. The Relief and Rehabilitation sub-group,chaired by secretary of social justice and environment ministry,is reportedly yet to clear Maharashtra action taken report. Referring to this issue,Modi on Thursday said that even after eight to nine months of submission of all data related to relief and rehabilitation of all three states,the Centre has not given nod to install gates. As secretary of water resources department at the Centre heads the NCA,Modi has repeatedly been blaming the Centre and the PM for delay.
Is installation of gates the only reason why Sardar Sarovar Dam has not reached its full potential?Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
No. The project started in 1982,and till date 60 per cent of its nearly 75,000-km-long canal networking work is pending. So,when a low height of the dam poses danger of losing huge quantum of water to overflow,at the same time in the absence of a complete canal network,despite water availability in the dam at present,several parts of Gujarat reel under water crisis. In absence of this network,notwithstanding the available quantum,it cannot achieve its target of irrigating 19.92 hectare of agricultural land. So even if dam height was raised to its maximum level by August last,when it was overflowing for almost two months,the government would have not been in position to avoid the drought-like situation in districts of Saurashtra-Kutch,north Gujarat and central Gujarat."

But it might be more accurate to say that the voice behind Seth’s voice is that of Jawaharlal Nehru’s, the putative author of The Discovery of India on which Benegal based his kaleidoscopic TV tome. First broadcast in 1988, this Doordarshan classic was Indian satellite TV viewers’ first introduction to Nehru’s scholarly gifts. The Nehruvians and the well-read elites may have devoured this doorstopper in the original but translating Nehru’s idea of India and its episodic investigation into our golden but wounded (to use a Naipaulian phrase) past meant the whole country could tune in to understand free India’s first prime minister’s way of thinking. Also, his hopes and aspirations vis-à-vis India’s leap into the 20th century.To read this story, sign up hereSign up to get quick access to Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.Email / Mobile:ContinueORContinue with FacebookContinue with GoogleAlready a member?

Ponderous history books have told us about Indian civilisation and its highs and lows. Bharat Ek Khoj treats that sacred history with due diligence and respect. For this TV experience, Benegal racked up not just the finest actors — Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Shabana Azmi and the whole caboodle from the parallel cinema pantheon of which he was the patron saint — but also the best researchers and historians for consultation.
Through 53 episodes, each lasting over 40 minutes, the show spans 5,000 years of Indian history. The idea, one can gather, was to explore the ‘Indian thought’ and explain to the audience how our civilisation started, how it flourished, what was trade and commerce like in the ancient past, the conquests and bloodshed as well as our centuries-old heritage, social reforms, religion and lores of the land. From Ramayana, Mahabharata, Indus valley civilization and the Buddha to Kalidas, Maurya, Ashoka, Shivaji, Akbar and Mahatma Phule, Bharat Ek Khoj’s searching eye conspires to piece together the spiritual puzzle that is India. With thousands of years of cultural war set on such an expansive canvas, you can imagine that this is simply too vast for even history buffs to make sense of, let alone binge-watch it in a single sitting. The Discovery of India was written by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in just five months’ time in the year 1944 while he was incarcerated in Ahmednagar fort prison camp between 1942-1945 for his involvement in the Quit India movement. The show takes up the book’s first-person narration framework, with Roshan Seth (playing Nehru) talking to his audience from jail. It is from here, filling out his diary pages, that Seth guides you through the various phases and eras of Indian history. While admittedly a prolific writer, Nehru wasn’t a historian. But despite no libraries or literature to consult, Nehru brings in an historian’s rigor. Much of this book was written from memory and partly with help from his jail companions like Maulana Azad, Govind Ballabh Pant, Narendra Deva and M Asaf Ali. Benegal renders Om Puri’s voice as a counterpoint to balance Nehru’s views. And what a privilege it is to listen to Seth and Puri’s voiceovers, as they bring Nehru’s magnum opus alive.
A mini-Indiahttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

There’s no one protagonist here because there’s no one story. It’s a tapestry of a plot with a full cast of characters. In telling the tale, whether it is the episode featuring Shivaji or Ramayana, Benegal uses folk singers and snippets from Ram-Leela to make the drama seem interesting and relatable. While the title song is in Sanskrit, the script is equally peppered with Urdu, perhaps underlining the form of diversity that Nehru believed in. At times, Bharat Ek Khoj’s set (a replica of mini-India, one imagines) may have seemed like an extension of Benegal’s spartan parallel cinema, which produced classics of the genre such as Ankur, Mandi, Manthan, Nishant and Bhumika. What further heightens this sense is the participation of New Wave regulars like Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and others. Put together, the entire cast of Bharat Ek Khoj can form a village. One of the show’s ingenious portrayals include Naseeruddin Shah as Shivaji Maharaj. It’s unusual to see Shah, otherwise offbeat cinema’s Mr Everyman, in a period spectacle but there’s a formal precision in his performance that justifies his casting as much as it astonishes. As you start watching the show and getting more entrenched in its historical sway, you meet more actors like Shah whose presence gives you a pleasant surprise. There’s Sadashiv Amrapurkar as Mahatma Phule, who along with his wife Savitribai faces stiff social opposition from locals as he goes about his social reforms, particularly towards education and untouchability. Some might wonder what a fresh-faced Lucky Ali is doing in this show, until you realise he started out as an actor.
Along the way, you also see a raw Irrfan Khan appearing as various characters. Freshly out of NSD, Khan wasn’t a big name yet and being a part of a Shyam Benegal show with his screen heroes like Om Puri and Naseer must have meant a great deal to a young actor like him. He’s dutifully pushed into smaller roles in the Chanakya, Akbar and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan chapters but the one in which he really comes into his own is episode no. 51. Titled Separatism, the episode follows the emergence of Muslim separatism foreshadowing the events of 1947, when India and Pakistan finally came into existence as two seperate nations divided on the basis of religious identities. Khan plays Salim, a young Iqbal-quoting, Aligarh-educated Muslim idealist in the golden age of Muslim League. His spiel on Islam and nationalism is in some ways a dress rehearsal to many of his great future performances. Carrying the bulk of the responsibility, Roshan Seth and Om Puri couldn’t have asked for a better role. Seth quickly became typecast as screen Nehru after playing him in Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi. Bharat Ek Khoj deploys him mainly as a narrator, more like an architect who doesn’t necessarily have to throw himself into action. After Seth, if the show has any cornerstone, it is Om Puri, an old Shyam Benegal hand. He’s superb as Ashoka and Duryodhana. Puri, who died in 2017, blends himself into the well-written content so fully. He was indeed a rare beast: he had a commanding screen presence and yet, a highly natural and adaptable style of acting.

Benegal is no stranger to the period genre. He gave us Junoon, based on the 1857 uprising, Kalyug, which was a modern-day iteration on Mahabharata, and Trikal, a retelling of Goan history as remembered by its prodigal son (played by Naseeruddin Shah), returning to his ancestral home. Later on in his career, the filmmaker reevaluated Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s revolutionary life in a 2004 film of the same name. As showrunner, Bharat Ek Khoj remains one of his most ambitious projects till date. The show’s authenticity is as much attributable to its writers and historians, including the likes of Shama Zaidi, Sunil Shanbag, Vasant Dev, Irfan Habib, RS Sharma etc, who served as advisers.
Prisoners of Our Age
In a 1980 foreword to The Discovery of India, Indira Gandhi noted that her father’s first three books which also includes Glimpses of World History and An Autobiography “have been my companions through life.” The father-daughter had a lifelong exchange of letters in which Nehru’s intelligence, curiosity and empathy shines through. Glimpses of World History is a literary gift to “Indira Priyadarshani” on whom the father doted. He was naturally concerned about her future but also wanted to welcome her into the adult world with Glimpses of World History. The correspondence between the two started as early as 1930, when Indira was barely in her early teens. The letters are deeply personal in nature, as Nehru often pours his heart out. Later, Indira is said to have corrected the proofs for The Discovery of India. “Books fascinated Jawaharlal Nehru,” Indira wrote. “He sought out ideas. He was extraordinarily sensitive to literary beauty. In his writings, he aimed at describing his motives and appraisals as meticulously as possible.” Nehru decided to write The Discovery of India after travelling the length and breadth of India during the freedom movement. At rallies, he met villagers who chanted “Bharat Mata ki jai” without knowing its proper implications. What is Bharat Mata, Nehru wondered. “Mother India was essentially these millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these people,” he concluded, an anecdote Benegal used in the first episode itself. Nehru was in awe of India, but there was something of an inner critic in him, too, which strove towards addressing the country’s faultlines and frailties. As he conceded, “India with all her infinite charm and variety began to grow upon me more and more.” Yet, he failed to understand what this vast country embodied. So he embarked on a literary voyage to find out.

Even though the man who led the independent nation into the modern world wrote that we are “prisoners of our age,” he equally saw India as an “ancient palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie has been inscribed.” At one point, he makes another crucial observation: “A civilization decays much more from inner failure than from an external attack. It may fail because in a sense it has worked itself out and has nothing more to offer in a changing world, or because the people who represent it deteriorate in quality and can no longer support the burden worthily.” Besides such cautious assertions, Nehru’s book simultaneously celebrates and questions religion (generally, as well as his own atheist tendencies), metaphysics, philosophy, politics, society, colonialism, Marxism, the Upanishads, Greek versus Indian civilisation, China, the freedom struggle, our epics and our way of life. Today, Nehru’s legacy is a political football boasting more critics than admirers. Many in the Right consider Nehru’s reign as India’s lost years, and are now trying their best to undo that past. As India’s first prime minister, they feel Nehru was supplied with the once-in-a-lifetime chance for change in the great nation’s life. In hindsight, they suggest that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel whose Statue of Unity has become one of the tallest symbols of national politics in recent years was the best prime minister India never had. Maybe, Patel would have been a lesser evil. Or maybe not. Let’s leave that to academics and politicians. While over the decades Nehru’s leadership has come to be seen as more missed opportunities and a tragic failure of lofty ambitions, his writings show us a man who was sensitive, subtle and iconoclastic. He had spent much of his youth in and out of British prisons. As he himself joked later on in life, he wasn’t in jail often enough to write even more books!"

(Source: Twitter)
Questioning the spending of Rs 3,000 crore on building the Statue of Unity, which was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Patidar quota leader Hardik Patel on Wednesday said that the government could have paid a tribute to Sardar Patel, who had led farmers’ agitation, by using that money for welfare of farmers in the form of crop insurance.
Hardik, who launched a Kisan Satyagrah here in Junagadh on Wednesday on the occasion of Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary, was joined by former Union minister Yashwant Sinha and BJP MP from Patna Sahib Shatrughan Sinha.
Speaking at the event Yashwant Sinha hit out the BJP and the Modi government at the Centre over a range of issues — corruption, price rise, Rafale deal, farmers income, among others.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Yashwant Sinha said that he felt guilty that he was part of a political party, which made promises to people but did not honour them and therefore, he was touring the country of late and apologising to people. He said that the Modi government had failed on every front and once he realised that this government was interested only in creating drama, he had distanced himself from the BJP. “For four years, I was hopeful that whatever promises were made to farmers will be fulfilled. But there came a time when I realised that it is not happening and that every section of the society, be it farmers, youth, women, Dalit and others are feeling deceived as this government has proven to be a government of jumla only,” he said.
Sinha welcomed the inauguration of Statue of Unity but suggested that had Modi announced some big welfare scheme for farmers, it would have been a more befitting tribute to Sardar Patel.
In his speech, Shatrughan Sinha said that he would not mind being labelled a rebel if telling the truth was rebellion. “People are asking me why I am rebelling against the BJP while I am a member of that same party. I tell them that while I am a member of the BJP, I am Indian first. Country is paramount. I like to state the truth. If telling the truth is rebellion then I accept the charge of being a rebel,” he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana)
The unveiling of India’s 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat Wednesday, which is set to become the “world’s tallest”, is being widely reported by the international media. From describing it as “a showcase of India’s growing prosperity” to calling it an example of “BJP’s efforts to appropriate a popular national figure”, the statue has received both praise and criticism. The State of Unity will be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary. The inauguration is expected to be a grand event planned along the lines of Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi.
The foundation stone of the Rs 2,989 crore project, erected on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat, was laid in October 2013 by Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. It has drawn flak from tribals and farmers living in the region who were against the enormous cost of the project as well as land acquisition by the government. They will observe a “black day” Wednesday,

US mediahttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A report in the Washington Post states that the Statue of Unity “will give India bragging rights to the world’s tallest statue — a nearly 600-foot creation that says as much about India’s global aspirations as it does about the political ego of its leader”. It adds, “The $408 million gold-coloured colossus also spills over into present-day politics. It is considered a trifecta for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a nod to his Hindu political base, a landmark site in his home state, and a showcase of the nation’s growing prosperity and status as a rising global power.”
Describing it as an unofficial launch of the BJP’s 2019 election campaign, it adds that “Modi seems to relish the big-splash attention of the projects.”
This report was carried by several organisations, including Canada’s National Post and Pakistan’s Dawn.
Pakistan media
Pakistan’s Express Tribune states that the statue has “became an example of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts to appropriate a popular national figure, as Patel was a member of the Congress Party, which now sits in opposition to BJP in India’s parliament.” Geo News, meanwhile, calling it “a burst of nationalist fervour”, highlights that “there is also a political motive to the mega project, with India heading into a campaign for a national election early next year.”
Chinese media
The South China Post, which carries an AFP report, states that the “world’s biggest statue could quickly be outdone by a monument to a Hindu warrior king in the sea off Mumbai” referring to Chhatrapati Shivaji’s statue in Mumbai. The report adds that it overlooks the isolated Sardar Sarovar Dam, which was PM Modi’s pet project.
British media
BBC has highlighted how local farmers are “aghast” that the government has spent so much money on the statue. It quotes a local farmer saying, “Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district.” It refers to a 2016 government report which says the Narmada district is home to several residents who live in hunger, while primary school enrolment is falling and malnourishment persists."

Sardar vs Patel
Besides announcing the October 31 event,where Narendra Modi would be laying the foundation stone for the Statue of Unity,the CMs portal played Tuesdays inauguration of the Sardar Patel museum at Shahibaug live. The museum has been renovated by a body headed by Union minister and Congress MP Dinsha Patel. The portal also posted live tweets from the speeches of Modi,Dinsha Patel and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. When Modi quoted 1919 as the year of Sardar Patels resolution in the Ahmedabad Municipality about reservation for women,Dinsha Patel corrected him,saying the resolution was passed in 1926. And this also went live. 
Interestingly,the English press release on Modis speech at the event,issued by the Gujarat Information department,played safe and did not mention the year of the resolution. It did refer to the Modi quote on Sardar Patel moving the resolution for womens reservation,though. However,as soon as Dinsha Patels speech went public,a news portal that openly supports Modi,posted a page from history,claiming Modi to be right. Its headline read: Dinsha Patel tried to be oversmart by correcting Modi….https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The news portal quoted a book written by Ahmedabad-based Dr Rizwan Kadri,who has done his doctoral research on Sardar Patels life and work,to debunk Dinsha Patel. It also posted a copy of a page claiming to be from the original municipal records belonging to  1919 to support its claim. 
Cleanliness cue
Chief Minister and BJPs prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi seems to be determined that the nation should observe the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi by carrying out cleanliness and sanitation drive. He had made this suggestion for the first time at the National Summit on Inclusive Urban Development last week. He made the same suggestion to the 14th Finance Commission team. Modi suggested that a national sanitation and cleanliness drive be launched,keeping in view Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebration in 2019.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) general board meet,that saw deputy mayor R D Desai retain his post,saw four condolence motions being passed. This included a resolution for the 115 devotees killed in a stampede in Datia (MP),death of former municipal councillor Indumati Kantilal Yagnik and playback singer Manna Dey. The last resolution,however,was the longest as it was loaded with political speeches condemning the death of seven persons in the serial blasts at Modis rally in Patna."

Dedicating the Statue of Unity to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the statue was not only a tribute to the valour and ability of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but also an expression of New India’s confidence. Modi also said Patel had given every Indian the responsibility to defeat any attempt to divide the country in the name of caste and religion and stay united.
Built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore, the statue is 182 m high, including the 25 m base. Said to be tallest in the world, the statue was also built in record time.
Remembering Patel’s efforts to unify the country after Independence, Modi said, “We had been carrying on this legacy of not providing a deserving place to a massive personality.”

Claiming that his government was taking forward Patel’s legacy of unifying the nation, he said, “Sabka saath, sabka vikas is our guiding principle. Sardar brought about political unification of the country by merger of princely states, while our government performed economic unification of the country through GST. We achieved the dream of One Nation, One Tax. We are constantly expanding Sardar’s pledge of uniting India. Whether it is the project of connecting all the agriculture produce markets of the country through e-NAM project…by introducing schemes like Bharatmala, Setu Bharatam, our government is striving to achieve Sardar’s dream of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.”

“This tallest statue of the world will remind the world and our future generations about the valour, ability and determination of a man who performed the pious duty of thwarting a conspiracy to divide Mother India,” he told the gathering of about 5,000 people.
Showering praise on Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary, Modi said, “After independence, pessimists felt that India will perish in its diversity…At that time, there was one ray of hope, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel…Sardar had the politics of Kautilya and valour of Shivaji Maharaj.”

Recalling the “sacrifice” of princely states who agreed to the merger of their kingdoms with the Union of India, Modi said, “The princely states had given an example of sacrifice and we should not forget it. I have a dream that there should be a virtual museum of more than 550 princely states who merged with India so that the future generations know about them.”
The foundation stone of the Statue of Unity was laid by Modi on October 31, 2013, when he was Gujarat Chief Minister. Modi said he never imagined that he will inaugurate the statue as Prime Minister. He recalled how farmers from across the country donated iron farm tools for the statue.

According to Modi, his government had launched a campaign to give recognition to great leaders of India like Dr B R Ambedkar, Shyamji Krishna Verma, Subhas Chandra Bose and Govind Guru.
“Some people in the country see this as politics. They react as if we have committed a crime (by recognising these leaders).”
Read | PM Modi writes: Sardar Patel worked with astonishing speed to dismantle the legacy of imperialism and create the geography of unity with the spirit of nationalism.
He said that the project will realise the dream of Sardar by bringing employment and tourism to the region. “Tourism activities would also change lives of locals here,” Modi said.
After the speech, the Prime Minister performed a puja near the feet of the statue, visited its exhibition hall and also went up to the viewing gallery of the statue at the height of 153 metres.
A team of Surya Kiran of Indian Air Force did aerobatics around the statue and spread colours of the Indian flag in the air. A team of IAF choppers showered rose petals on the statue whereas, a team of Jaguars from IAF did a fly past.
Modi spent about three hours at the site, also visiting the Valley of Flowers and the Tent City with Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, Madhya Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel and several state cabinet ministers. Religious leaders and distant relatives of Sardar Patel were also present. At the Wall of Unity, BJP president Amit Shah was with the Prime Minister."

Thousands of Chinese workers are expected to arrive at Sadhu Bet in Narmada district end of this year to begin work on the Statue of Unity, a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — a project launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Gujarat chief minister.
Even as Congress criticised the project as defeating the “Make in India” initiative launched by Modi, after reports that the statue’s bronze parts will be made in a foundry in China, the Gujarat government said it has no control over where the contractor company gets the material from.
The Statue of Unity is slated to be the world’s tallest statue at 182 metres. For the project, Modi had launched a nationwide farm tool collection drive symbolic of “unifying the country”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the company contracted by the Gujarat government for the Rs 3,000-crore project, has sub-leased the “bronze cladding” of the statue to TQ Art Foundry, part of the Jiangxi Toqine Company in Nanchang. Hundreds of Chinese workers are also expected to arrive in Narmada to “assist” L&T in the concrete construction of the statue core.
According to officials of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), a special purpose vehicle headed by CM Anandiben Patel, “High quality prototypes of precast facade that will be shipped in from China and assembled at the site.”
Member secretary of SVPRET K Srinivas said, “They (L&T) will be getting 25,000 pieces of bronze from China…The company is free to get the material from the best possible place.”
The steel frame work, also being procured from China, will be “contoured in the form of the statue” and “the cladding will be the facade”.
Emails to Jiangxi Toqine went unanswered, as did phone calls.

In a run-up to the inauguration of the Statue of Unity, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and the Department of Civil Aviation are exploring all possibilities of launching the seaplane service in the state that has been promised by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government ever since Modi rode a seaplane ride from Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad to Dharoi Dam in Ambaji as part of his campaign for the Gujarat Assembly polls in December, 2017.
A feasibility report prepared by the authorities has identified a spot on the premises of the Narmada Dam where the seaplane will land whenever the service takes off.Ahmedabad
According to officials of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), a multi-level committee comprising of officials from the aviation department as well as private jet operators visited the site of Pond 3 in Narmada in early July to survey it as a possible seaplane terminal. The rock-filled pond is officially named Panchmuli Lake and popularly called the ‘Magar Talav’ as it is infested with crocodiles. The site was finalized a few weeks later as its dimensions suit the requirements of landing the seaplane, which requires a minimum width of 900 meters in a water body with a depth of at least six feet.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official of SSNNL said, “When the civil aviation department approached the SSNNL for the project, we recommended Pond 3 to them as it has a vast body and is perfect for landing seaplanes. The team also liked the site. The aviation department will take care of the operations and the other aspects of the project.” The Narmada Dam premises have four scenic lakes in total between Sardar Sarovar and the Main Canal head regulator, namely Vadgam Lake (Pond 1), Baharfalia Lake (Pond 2), Panchmuli Lake (Pond 3) and Khalvani Lake (Pond 4).
The proposal to start seaplane service connecting Narmada Dam to Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad and Tapi River is part of the plan to boost tourism in Kevadia colony, which is home to the 182-meter tall Statue of Unity dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Guruprasad Mohapatra, Chairman, AAI, said, “The Pond 3 of Narmada is among the suitable sites in the state for landing seaplanes. However, there has to be a demand that has to come from the intending flight operators because creating the infrastructure is beneficial only when there is demand. The Ministry is contemplating the classification of seaplane services across the country under the Udaan initiative for the next bid. Private player SpiceJet is intending to bring the service of seaplane.”
Officials of the state government confirm that the seaplane project is a plan to boost tourism to Statue of Unity. An official of the Tourism department said, “While the idea to have seaplanes is primarily connectivity between tourist spots, the fact also is that Statue of Unity will see heavy footfall once it is ready. The tourism will get a big boost with the presence of the aerodrome services in the area”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Standing tall at 182 meters on Sandhu island of Narmada river, the Statue of Unity was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 143rd birth anniversary of freedom fighter and India’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The statue, which was constructed at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore, is now the world’s tallest and twice the size of the Statue of Liberty in New York.
The statue of Patel is an “answer to those who question India’s existence”, PM Modi said at the inaugural ceremony in Gujarat’s Kevadiya district. “The height of the statue is to remind the youth that the future of the country will be as huge as this.”
In Delhi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore flagged off the annual ‘Run for Unity’ in honour of Patel’s 143rd birth anniversary. The campaign was organised in various parts of the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb flagged off the ‘Run for Unity’ in Chennai and Agartala respectively.
Sitharaman, besides Tamil Nadu Ministers D Jayakumar and SP Velumani, participated in the event.  freedom fighter’s statue in Gujarat. “We are attending the Run for Unity to mark that (dedication of Patel statue). Youngsters have turned up in good numbers today. They have to play an active role in the country remaining united,” she said.
Biplab Deb was among those invited to the inaugural ceremony but he chose to observe ‘Rashtriya Ekta Divas’ in Tripura. “Sardar Ballavbhai Patel unified entire India with all his might and ensured our unity. The most important thing is that he did this without any battle, not even an exchange of barb with anyone. I remember him and congratulate Prime Minister for observing his birthday as Rashtriya Ekta Divas on behalf of people of Tripura”, Biplab Kumar Deb said.
‘Systematic destruction’ of India’s institutions is treason: Rahul Gandhi
While the statue received praise from around the nation, Congress president Rahul Gandhi pointed out how every institution Patel helped build is allegedly being torn down by the ruling government. “The systematic destruction of India’s institutions is nothing short of treason,” Gandhi wrote on Twitter.
In another tweet, Gandhi said Patel was a patriot, who fought for an independent, united and secular India. “A man with a steely will, tempered by compassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism. On his birth anniversary, I salute this great son of India,” he tweeted.

In Uttar Pradesh, BSP president Mayawati demanded an apology from those who had flayed her over the statues of Dalit leaders her government had installed in the state.
“All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj, for terming the statues installed by the then BSP government to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,” she said in a statement.
“The people of the country are also wondering if all this is not politics, and if the BJP really had this love for Patel why had they not put up such a massive statue earlier in Gujarat where they are in power for a long time,” she said.
The Bahujan Samaj Party chief paid tributes to Vallabhbhai Patel, known as the ‘Iron man of India’, on his 143rd birth anniversary. She said like Dalit leader Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel was also a nationalist and was widely respected.
Meanwhile, the CPI demanded why a bigger statue of Mahatma Gandhi was not built by the BJP, as he is the “tallest leader of Indian politics”.
“They (BJP) do not like his (Gandhi’s) secularism, that is why they have not taken up (build his statue). Instead, they have gone for Patel, who had rightist ideas,” the CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy alleged.
Tribals protest
The money spent on the statue drew heavy criticism from local tribal leaders in and around Narmada district, claiming “mass destruction” of resources due to the project.
In an open letter, addressed to Modi, sarpanches of 22 villages near the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada river, wrote “We villagers want to tell you with extreme grief that we will not welcome you on October 31. Even if you come here like an unwanted guest, you are not welcome here.”

Protesting against the BJP government snatching the rights of tribals in Gujarat, tribal activists and leaders questioned how would the tribal community benefit from the statue. The protest led to the detention of 16 tribal activists and leaders.
Patel’s family members say “Congress did nothing like this”
Patel’s family members hailed the ‘Statue of Unity’ as a “befitting tribute” to the ‘Iron Man of India’, saying it would help the younger generation know about his life and it should have been done much earlier by the previous governments.
“Congress didn’t do anything like this for Sardar Patel. The statue is a befitting tribute to his contribution to the nation,” said Dhirubhai Patel, grandson of Sardar’s elder brother Somabhai Patel.
Dhirubhai, 91, was a special invitee to the ceremony this morning. Besides Dhirubhai, who lives in Vadodara with his family, the event was attended by 35 other members of Vallabhbhai Patel’s extended family.
Sardar Patel, the first Home Minister of Independent India, is credited with merging 550 princely states into the Union of India. He had used force to annex princely states of Junagadh ruled by Nawab and Hyderabad ruled by Nizam, both of whom had wished not to merge their respective states with Union of India.
Bhupendra Patel, 80, another senior member of the family, said the statue would remind the younger generation about contributions made by Sardar.

“They will draw inspiration from Sardar Patel,” said Bhupendra, who lives in Vallabh Vidyanagar in Anand district.
He refused to comment when asked whether the previous governments did little for Sardar as being claimed by leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Dhirubhai’s son-in-law Shailesh Patel, a Mumbai-based businessman, was more forthcoming.
“This (statue) was long overdue. They should have done it much earlier. The statue will spread the message of the strength of unity and of the role played by Sardar to unite the nation,” he said.
Sardar Patel Memorial Trust’s founder-secretary Hasmukh Patel, who was also among the special invitees at the event, said it was a “good decision” to build the Sardar statue.
“The younger generation needs to learn from Sardar’s life and this statue will be a unique way to do so,” he said, adding that the prime minister has “recaptured Sardar’s memory in a unique way”.
Several tourist attractions 
The Statue of Unity, which opens for the public on Thursday, is expected to attract around 10,000 tourists daily, a state government official said.
A visitor can take a lift installed inside the statue which runs at a speed of 4 metres per second to reach a viewers gallery at a height of 135 metres.
The gallery will offer scenic vistas of the river Narmada, the dam and the surrounding Satpura range of hills, a state tourism department official said.

A museum and exhibition hall have been constructed inside the gigantic structure, depicting the life and times of India’s `Iron Man’.
The tourism department has also constructed a guest house, `Sreshtha Bharat Bhavan’, where tourists can stay.
There will be charges for visitors: Rs 120 per person for viewing the statue from outside, Rs 350 for visiting the viewers’ gallery at 135 metres.
Two Tent Cities with a total of 250 tents along two lakes near the dam, equipped with modern facilities, are also being touted as a major attraction, where one can camp in a natural environment.
Spread across 70,000 square metres, the Tent Cities will run on green energy, said the official.
A 17-kilometre long `Valley of Flowers’ is being developed along the banks of the river near the statue.
An area of 240 hectares has already been developed in the first phase of Valley of Flowers project, the official said. It will feature five nature trails for tourists.
A ‘Wall of Unity’ has also been constructed using the soil collected from across the country under a campaign launched by Modi in 2013.
A release from Gujarat chief minister’s office said the monument will be open for tourists from tomorrow.
International media
The statue, however, gained international attention. A report in the Washington Post stated that the statue “will give India bragging rights to the world’s tallest statue.” It further read, “It is considered a trifecta for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a nod to his Hindu political base, a landmark site in his home state, and a showcase of the nation’s growing prosperity and status as a rising global power.”
Beside US media, Pakistan Express Tribue, South China Post and BBC took note of the statue of unity as well.
Along with Modi and Shah, the inauguration of the statue was also marked by the presence of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel.

Space is the final frontier for mankind’s thirst of exploration and adventure. For all the anti-adventurists and killjoys, there are some obvious real-world applications in agriculture, telecom, weather forecasting, defence, medicine, natural resources and rare elements. Humans could become a space fairing species in another 30 years, perhaps even before if Elon Musk gets his way.
After the Apollo missions were completed, the world somehow lost interest in lunar missions. Scientists and space enthusiasts were still hopeful but public support faded away. For the next 50 years or so, a large number of the rocket launches made by the space organisations of the world were to put satellites in lower earth orbits, basically for communications and, let’s face it, for snooping on other countries. A relatively smaller number of missions were academically motivated.
The remarkable feats achieved by ISRO on July 22 and in other previous missions have made all Indians proud. Mostly because of two reasons: First, the critical parts of this mission — cryogenics, the orbiter, lander and the rover — are all indigenously developed. And second, the estimated cost of this project is Rs 978 crore only. I know putting “only” after that figure will surely raise eyebrows but do a Google search and compare it with what other space agencies have spent to achieve similar successes. Fun fact: The last Avengers movie was made at a cost of Rs 2,443 crore. It is in this context that I disagree with your editorial, ‘Another giant leap’ (IE, July 23) which counsels fiscal prudence on space missions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chandrayaan 2 was scheduled as early as 2011-12 in collaboration with Roskosmos. Failure in their Mars mission and following delays in the delivery of the lander forced the Russians to back out from the agreement signed on November 12, 2007. This led ISRO to develop the mission entirely in-house, which they did in a very short time. On July 15, the snag during the final countdown and the temporary cancellation of the launch may have given a reason to the international media and other space agencies to second guess India’s capabilities. But within a week, with a successful launch and that too with a very narrow launch window, ISRO made a statement, not with just words but with action.
Another example of the genius of our scientists was emphasised when they had to test the in-house made rover on a moon like surface. The moon’s surface is covered with craters, rocks and dust and its soil is of a different texture as compared to the earth’s. Importing lunar soil-like substance from the US was costly, hence ISRO decided to get “anorthosite” rocks from a couple of Tamil Nadu villages. They then crushed these rocks to the desired specifications and sent it to a test facility at Bengaluru, which resulted in huge savings. Scientists from NIT Tiruchirappalli, Periyar University, Salem and IISC Bengaluru worked on this project.
The remarkable part, however, is not the lower costs of these missions but the efficiency and the rate of success of these missions.
Though Chandrayaan 2 has been splendidly covered by The Indian Express, the conclusion of the editorial is somewhat discouraging from a scientist’s point of view.
Government spending on flagship programmes has increased several times during the past couple of decades, while their return on investment both monetarily and in terms of standard of living is sub-par. On the other hand, there are certain expenditures for which the real motivation is the misguided notion of patriotism. For example, the Statue of Unity has an estimated cost of Rs 2,966 crore and the proposed Shivaji statue is estimated to cost Rs 3,600 crore. I am not against the commemoration of our national heroes, but can we not make their memorials less extravagant and give rest of the money to institutions like ISRO, DRDO and NDMA?
In India, where most government institutions eventually end up spending more than what was initially proposed, ISRO is an exception. Immediately after this success, rather than pivoting the zeitgeist towards supporting the organisation through more funding and resources, we are cautioning the agency to set its priorities right and have asked it to show fiscal prudence. That does not seem fair.
So yes, Dear Editor, I disagree with the conclusion of your editorial.

Currently, the seaplane service from Sabarmati Riverfront to Statue of Unity in Narmada district is suspended for 15 days, until December 15, as the amphibious aircraft has flown to its home country, the Maldives, for mandatory maintenance and servicing. The new water hangar, officials said, will allow the maintenance and servicing of the seaplane to be undertaken locally.
Explained: What is India’s first seaplane project and how will it function?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The SpiceJet, which has a three-year contract with the Gujarat government to operate the service between Ahmedabad and the three destinations — of which, the Statue of Unity route was inaugurated on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi — confirmed that a water hangar is under construction at Sabarmati Riverfront.
“At this point in time, what we are looking at and what is under progress is the construction of a wet and dry dock and this will act as a temporary maintenance hangar for seaplanes and over a period of time we will see where a permanent hangar can be built,” SpiceJet told The Indian Express in response to an email query.
Since its launch on October 31, the seaplane service has been suspended for maintenance at least twice. On November 3, just three days after the launch, the plane was docked for two days at the Sabarmati riverfront for repairs. Its operation was suspended again on November 29 when the plane, registered under the ownership of Maldivian Aero, flew back to the Maldives for maintenance.
“These aircraft need regular maintenance, and in the absence of a dry and wet dock, this aircraft couldn’t be maintained properly in India. At SpiceJet, safety is the topmost priority. The aircraft has been flown to the Maldives for essential maintenance and our operations will resume on December 15 once the aircraft is back,” the airline’s spokesperson said.
Captain Ajay Chauhan, the Director of Aviation of Gujarat, said the AAI’s hangar that is coming up at Sabarmati Riverfront will be a “permanent” structure. “The hangar is being constructed by the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and Airports Authority of India. There will be underwater pillars and it will be an RCC structure that will allow an aircraft to land and be serviced. The current contract with SpiceJet is for three years and there could be more operators in the future. The overall period of the Udan scheme is of 10 years, so we are looking at it as a permanent structure.”
Chauhan said the Gujarat government has sought environmental clearance and received the Terms of Reference (TOR) from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) for Sabarmati, Kevadia and Palitana in September this year, but the work on the construction of the water aerodrome terminal at Shatrunjay Dam in Palitana is yet to commence. “It is up to SpiceJet to begin operations on the second route between Sabarmati Riverfront and Palitana. There is no impediment in the project due to pending environmental clearances. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic and fewer travellers, the operator is taking it slow… Once the pandemic is over, the work on the construction of the aerodrome on Shatrunjay Dam will commence,” Chauhan said.
The state government, sources said, has asked SpiceJet to bring in a younger seaplane as compared to the Twin Otter 300 that flew on the Ahmedabad-Kevadia route. The airline, however, has denied any plans to change the 49-year-old aircraft from the Maldives. “The aircraft had last undergone an overhaul and seat refurbishments on July 28, 2019. An overhaul of Twin Turboprop Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine was done on October 8, 2019,” it said.
Asked if the SpiceJet was looking to convert the existing wet-lease agreement with Maldivian firm (under which the owner company provides the entire service, insurance, operations and maintenance as well as crew in lieu of a fee to SpiceJet) into a dry lease, the SpiceJet spokesperson said, “At this point in time, we are only looking for wet-lease as under it one gets a significant value addition in form of experienced crew and engineering team. As we gain experience, we will have our own crew and engineering team and will convert the wet-lease into a dry lease.”
Dry lease is an arrangement covering the hire of an aircraft for a certain period which does not include the provision of a flight crew.
Meanwhile, Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure Company Ltd (GujSAIL) has invited bids for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of rotating beacons on the water aerodrome at Sabarmati Riverfront and Statue of Unity. The last date for the bidding is December 15.
The tender states, the work for the installation of the beacons must be mandatorily completed “within a period of 30 days from the date of signing of contract”.

A GujSAIL official said, “Airport beacons are used to help pilots identify an airport or airstrip at night. They are operational from sunset to sunrise and during the twilight hours. Sometimes, they are turned on if the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet and/or the ground visibility is less than three statute miles (VFR minimums). The beacon has a vertical light distribution to make it effectively visible from the horizon. It could also have dimensions, rotations or flashlights. The colour of the light indicates the type of airport. For instance, white and green lights are flashed for civilian land airports, while white and yellow lights are for water airport. Helipads and military airbases have different beacon colours,” an official said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

BJP’s Chandigarh unit is set to launch its campaign to collect material for the Statue of Unity to be constructed in Gujarat. As part the nation-wide campaign, the party is collecting pieces of iron from tools used by farmers as well as soil from sacred places. In Chandigarh, the campaign is likely to be initiated from January 23.
A total of 12 resource kits, one for each panchayat have been received in the BJP office. Each of the kits has a box to collect iron, a bottle to collect soil, posters, books, VCDs and material about Sardar Patel. The BJP is yet to take a decision on whether villages of the city under the municipal limits will be part of the campaign or not.
A meeting for the preparation of the event was held at the BJP office two days ago. Party workers would be assigned different areas from where the collection would be done. Along with this, pictures of members of the gram panchayat would be clicked and sent to Gujarat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The statue of Sardar Patel is expected to be the tallest in the world at 182 metres. Further, it will contain a gallery where pictures of all gram panchayats members from where the material is being collected would be kept.

The project initiated by BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is expected to help the party reach out to voters in remote corners of the country in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections.
National co-ordinator of the project OP Dhanker said, “We are covering 6.5 lakh villages across the country. The soil from villages would be collected from schools and religious places. The literature being distributed is in the native language of the state. The campaign for Chandigarh and Punjab will start shortly. In Haryana, it would be completed by the end of January.”Chandigarh NewsWithdraw stir on humanitarian grounds: Khattar to farmersTika Utsav concludes, Punjab fails to hit its daily target even onceSukhbir promises Dalit deputy CM if voted to power, BJP the CM postClick here for more
President of BJP’s city unit Sanjay Tandon said preparations for the campaign were on. “We have received the kits. Next week we will go to villages to collect the material. If there is a demand that villages under the municipal corporation are also included, we would do that,” he said."

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday paid tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said people like him do not divide people on the basis of “caste and creed”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled Patel’s ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat the same day.
“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel never wanted to divide people. He always pursued a politics of unity. Today, on his birth anniversary, the country must stay united. I feel those who are great leaders of the country treat all the people with equal respect. They do not divide people on the basis of caste and creed,” Mamata said at a public meeting in Jalpaiguri.
The 182-metre-high Statue of Unity, planned as a tribute to Patel and his contributions, was built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore. “This world is one big country. There are people speaking various languages and practicing various rituals. But at the end of the day, we are one and that is our our biggest identity,” she added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, the chief minister also hit out at the Centre for bringing “black days” to the country in the name of “acche din”.
“What is acche din? Can we describe dark days as acche din? Those who drive out people can never bring acche din in the country no matter how much they try… However, there is peace on in Bengal and they are trying to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere here. But we will maintain peace here and we want the country to remain united. That will be the acce din for the country,” she said.
Mamata also slammed the erstwhile Left Front and Congress governments in the state for not undertaking any development work in north Bengal districts.Kolkata NewsBengal Covid patient count tops 32,000 after another record jumpRahul Gandhi in his first Bengal rally: ‘BJP wants to destroy Bengal’s culture; TMC fight not ideological’Bengal: Amid Covid vaccine shortage, doctors warn of post-poll strain on health systemClick here for more

Some tribals from villages around the Statue of Unity (SoU) site in Narmada district, on Tuesday, said that they are being deprived of the benefits of projects and that they do not want to give their lands for tourism purposes in the region. They addressed a press conference in Ahmedabad in the presence of former Chief Minister Suresh Mehta and former minister Pravinsinh Jadeja, along with some social activists.
Dakshaben Kanubhai from Limdi village, which is near the SoU site, said, “They have acquired our land and are now harassing us on various grounds. In the name of cleanliness, they have impounded my calf for the past three days and are demanding Rs 300.” She said that somebody has been given a lease to run a food parlour near SoU on her family land, whereas the authorities have turned another land parcel of her family into a parking area for the upcoming October 31 event, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the site.
Another tribal, Govind Tadvi, Sarpanch of Vagadia village, said that the government is acquiring their land in the name of tourism without making tribals the beneficiaries of the projects. Govind said that by acquiring their land, the government wants to evict them. “If the government is planning to turn the place into heaven, why don’t they let tribals be a part of that heaven?” he asked.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shakuntala Tadvi from Kevadia alleged that authorities are forcefully taking their land, adding that she has two sons and both are unemployed. “Jobs are being given to outsiders from Ahmedabad, Vadodara and other areas (but not to local tribals),” she said.
Notably, acting on a public interest litigation (PIL) moved by an Ahmedabad-based activist, the HC had ordered to maintain status quo on land acquisition in six villages around SoU. The land of these villages was claimed to be acquired by Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) in the 1960’s, but its possession remained with the tribals. The petitioner has demanded that since the possession of the land remained with the tribals for these many years, the government cannot take it back now.
The quantum of such land, the tribals said, is 1700 acre of which 1100 acre has been in possession of the SSNNL or the state government.
Social activist Lakhan Musafir said that the tribals are only being given petty jobs and the government should give the food court at the SoU site to tribals as they can run it. He also alleged that in the name of cleanliness, domestic animals are being impounded by the authorities.
Punabhai Tadvi, another tribal from the region, alleged that to preempt any protest by them during PM Modi’s visits to the place, authorities detain locals. “They put us under house arrest whenever there is a programme of the PM. People from outside are being brought in buses, but the locals are put under house arrest till the PM does not leave the place.”
Addressing the press conference, Suresh Mehta said that without taking local tribals into confidence and any transparency, three government authorities — Tourism Department, SSNNL and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriyal Ekta Trust (SVPRET) — are implementing multiple projects. The former CM alleged that the SoU project was implemented while diverting the funds of SSNNL at the cost of the canal network’s irrigation efficiency. He added that the number of affected villages in the region would be around 72, as the government will bring in a number of projects in the name of converting the area into a tourism centre.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Meanwhile, Gujarat BJP condemned the statements of former CM Suresh Mehta and called him a “person with anti-Gujarat mentality”. Spokesperson of Gujarat BJP Bharat Pandya said, “This is a group of people opposed to the Narmada Dam project. The Statue of Unity is pride of Gujarat and every day 8,500 tourists are visiting it… it generates employment. Opposing such a project is not in the interest of Gujarat.”"

Dedicating the government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday said that a “temporary wall” between Indians, which encouraged separatism and terrorism, has now fallen.
Addressing a gathering in Narmada’s Kevadia Colony on Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, and also the day J&K state formally split into two Union Territories, Modi said: “For decades, Article 370 stood between us Indians like a temporary wall. Our brothers and sisters on the other side of this temporary wall would

always be in a state of confusion. This wall that promoted separatism and terrorism in Kashmir, today, as I stand before this grand statue of Sardar saheb, I bow my head before him and with complete humility, I am settling this account — ‘Sardar saheb, your incomplete dream… now this wall has been brought down’.”
Standing alone on the podium at the site of Sardar Patel’s Statue of Unity, the Prime Minister said: “Sardar Patel has once said that if Kashmir’s issue was handed over to him, then resolving the issue would not have taken so long. He had warned the country that the only solution to the issue was the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India. Today, on his birth anniversary, I dedicate the decision of the removal of Article 370, taken on August 5, to Sardar saheb.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Prime Minister also expressed happiness over the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission in J&K and Ladakh with effect Thursday and emphasised that both UTs will take strong steps towards a prosperous future.
Pointing to the recent Block Development Council (BDC) elections in J&K, Modi said: “After Independence, the people of Jammu and Kashmir were not allowed to exercise their democratic rights because of Article 370. For the very first time, BDC elections were held and 98 per cent panch and sarpanch cast their vote. There will be political stability now. Forming and dissolving governments for personal gains will now be put to an end.”
Turning to the Northeast, Modi said that the situation there was changing due to the government’s initiatives. “Decade-old issues are now nearing solutions. After a long period of violence, the entire Northeast region has now gained freedom from it. And this was not through violence but by developing an emotional connect,” he said.

The Prime Minister also spoke about “forces trying to destroy the country’s unity in vain” — he did not name anyone, though. “Those who cannot defeat us in wars are trying to disrupt our unity. They are fuelling separatists and challenging our unity in diversity. But they forget that similar attempts have been made over the decades, but no one could harm us or defeat us,” he said.
Earlier, Modi marked the occasion by offering tributes to the Statue of Unity, which has completed a year since it was unveiled. He also accepted the replica of the National Police Memorial from the wife of a CRPF jawan who was among the 40 killed during the terror attack in Pulwama in February."

In an unprecedented move, four senior-most Supreme Court judges – Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph – held a press conference in January launching a sharp attack against the then CJI Dipak Misra for “ignoring the concerns voiced by them”. Adding that “all is not well” in the apex court, the judges questioned Misra over the manner in which the cases were assigned in the roster.
Underlining they were convinced that democracy will not survive if the institution of judiciary was not protected, they said they have failed to convince Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra about the same. Adding that they had no choice but to go public with their concerns, the judges said: “We don’t want wise men saying 20 years from now that we sold our souls and didn’t do the right thing by our Constitution.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

An extraordinary southwest monsoon in Kerala unleashed unprecedented floods and landslides in the state, the magnitude of which has rarely been observed in recent memory.

Assembly elections were held in several states including Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. Among these, Congress formed government in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh, while TRS retained Telangana and MNF won Mizoram. In Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura where elections were held in February, Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP)’s Neiphiu Rio, Conrad Sangma of National People’s Party (NPP) and Biplab Kumar Deb of BJP, respectively were elected as chief ministers.
However, a high-octane assembly poll, a thrilling government formation exercise filled with nail-biting twists and turns, and never-ending coalition worries encapsulated 2018 in Karnataka. While the BJP got the majority, its state chief BS Yeddyurappa could not pass the floor test and had to resign a day after taking over as the chief minister.

In 2018, the Supreme Court passed historic judgments on several matters including women’s entry to Sabarimala shrine, Section 377, Aadhaar, Adultery among others. On September 6, scrapping the 157-year-old colonial-era law on homosexuality, the top court overturned its previous order on Section 377 and decriminalised gay sex. The section will, however, continue to apply to bestiality and sexual acts without consent and those involving a minor. In another verdict, the court lifted centuries’ old prohibition of menstruating women between ages 10 and 50 from entering Sabarimala temple in Kerala on September 28. However, despite several attempts, no women have been able to visit the shrine yet due to huge protests against the order.
The Supreme Court on September 26 declared that use of Aadhaar was constitutional but ruled that it is unconstitutional to make it compulsory when a citizen wants to avail government services. The then CJI Dipak Misra said banks and telecommunication companies should not make it mandatory for their customers to link Aadhaar number to their phone number and bank accounts.

2018 also saw a massive agitations by farmers from across the country several times. While some protests were held against the government to get fair prices for their agricultural produce, others were for the farm loan waiver and package for drought-affected regions. Last year, BJP’s Yogi Adityanath and Devendra Fadnavis had announced loan waiver of Rs 36,359-crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. On the other hand, the Congress after winning three states recently has announced loan waiver of Rs 35,000-38,000 crore, Rs 18,000 crore and Rs 6,100 crore for Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, respectively. Read More
Changing names of cities
This year three cities in Uttar Pradesh were renamed. Allahabad become Prayagraj, Faizabad renamed as Ayodhya and and Mughal Sarai’s name was changed to to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.
PM Modi on October 31 unveiled the world’s tallest statue — Statue of Unity — as a tribute to the freedom fighter and India’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The 182-metre long statue, twice the size of the Statue of Liberty, is built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore. Following this, the Uttar Pradesh government’s also announced that it will build a 221-metre statue of Lord Ram in Ayodhya. Soon after this, the Maharashtra government said that it may increase the height of the proposed Shivaji memorial statue (212 m) to make it taller than the Ram statue.

2018 saw a bitter fight between CBI Director Alok Verma and his number two, Special Director Rakesh Asthana, which had “exposed the CBI to ridicule”. Amid several accusations, allegations and investigations, the Government decided to divest Alok Kumar Verma, Rakesh Asthana of their functions, power, duty and supervisory role in any manner as Director and Special Director, respectively as an interim measure till the CVC concludes its inquiry. Currently, Nageshwar Rao, IPS, who was working as CBI Joint Director, was appointed to look after the duties and functions of the director.

The court said it was satisfied with the procurement process and that it found no reason to interfere in the pricing or the offset partner chosen as part of the deal. The Congress, however, is demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the matter saying the government presented “wrong facts” before the Supreme Court which led to “factual bloomers” in the Rafale aircraft deal judgment that gave the government relief.

Urjit Patel resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10 citing personal reasons amid a bitter dispute over the regulator’s autonomy. A day after, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das was appointed the 25th governor of the RBI. For Das, the biggest challenge now is to handle the pressure from the government on issues such as the restructuring of loans, infusing liquidity and sticking to its strict default norms for resolution of bad debts in banks’ books, where the Centre has favoured a more lenient approach. Meanwhile, Patel, who had taken over the reins of the RBI from Raghuram Rajan in September 2016, has become the first governor since 1990 to step down before the end of his term. His term was supposed to end in September 2019."

(Source: Express Photo)
Over 100 people from around six villages near the newly inaugurated Statue of Unity marched into the statue complex on Monday and staged a dharna near the ticket counter demanding jobs at the integrated complex.
The people, from villages including Navagaam, Waghadia, Mukhudi, have said that since they live close to the statue, and many of them lost their lands for the construction of first the Sardar Sarovar Dam and then the Statue of Unity, which also included widening of roads and the Shreshta Bharat Bhavan, they should be given priority in the job process.
Sarpanch of Navagaam village, located between the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Garudeshwar weir Dam, who also joined the protest said, “As many as 52 farmers from my village have been affected. The land which was the main source of our income was acquired. Now we do not even have jobs secured for the next generation. Parts of our farms which were not acquired by the government were washed away after water was released from the weir dam to enhance the beautification of the area around the Statue. We are suffering from every end with no respite or relief in sight.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Unlike the other protests so far which were led by tribal leaders and activists from the area, the villagers on Monday appeared to have come out in protest on their own without any guidance or directions by any leaders or activists.
According to police, the villagers walked inside the premise of the statue complex till the ticket counter and staged a dharna and raised slogans demanding job opportunities at the SoU. Additional police forces from Kevadiya police station were rushed to the spot to control the situation and disperse the crowd. No detentions or arrests were made, the police said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The villagers had earlier made representations to the President, Governor, Prime Minister, and Chief Minister among others, demanding that people recruited for any job at the complex should only be from the tribal belt who should also be trained in skill development. They had also urged that the water from the Narmada Dam for irrigation should be first provided to the local farmers."

(Express photo)
The Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), on Monday, issued a statement on the ongoing controversy over land acquisition in six villages surrounding the Statue of Unity (SoU) in Kevadia colony of Narmada district. Village tribals have called for a bandh and been on protest for over a week. SSNNL, in its statement, has made public the compensation package it had put forth before the Gujarat High Court (HC) in February, in reply to a PIL filed against the acquisition.
Apart from announcing a relocation plan for the displaced families, SSNNL has agreed to allot commercial shops in a complex of the SoU parking lot to those affected, in compensation for shops and stalls razed from these six villages. The announcement comes days after villagers got into a scuffle with the local police, that was accompanying SSNNL officials to fence the land which SSNNL “has acquired”. The statement on Monday said, “SSNNL is only fencing the land that it has measured as part of its acquisition claim. No other private land has been forcefully fenced or acquired.”
The contention of the villagers of Limbdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora is that SSNNL had sought the land acquisition 60 years ago for the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam. However, it is now intending to put the land to use for other commercial purposes, which is why the SSNNL claim on the land should be invalidated.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On May 30, 18 Congress leaders, including eight Gujarat MLAs, were detained in district headquarters Rajpipla on their way to join the Kevadia protest.
In its statement, SSNNL said that a settlement for beneficiaries from six villages would be relocated to an ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ project to be constructed over 16 hectares of land belonging to SSNNL in Gora village, across Narmada river downstream from SoU. The SSNNL in its statement said, “We will also construct concrete roads, ensure a network of tap water connections in all homes, drainage lines, aanganwadis, primary health centres, toilets in all homes as well as primary schools at an expenditure of Rs 15 crore.”
As per the guidelines of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA), all male heirs of a family displaced due to the project, who are 18 years of age as of November 1 1989, are to be given a plot of 1,000 square feet and a 250 square feet plot for animal husbandry. SSNNL estimates 1,000 such beneficiaries in the ongoing issue. It has also extended financial help to build houses amounting to Rs 4 lakh per beneficiary, of which 1.5 lakh to be given by the state government and Rs 2.5 lakh by SSNNL.
Additionally, SSNNL said it is willing to accommodate the demands of some beneficiaries who accepted the compensation offered by the government in 1992, but later expressed displeasure and keenness to opt for the revised package of 2013. “We will allow such 61 beneficiaries and 82 major sons of these beneficiaries to give up their earlier compensation and choose the new package,” it stated.
The official release said that the package had been “arrived upon after consensus” of high ranking officials of SSNNL as well as members of the six villages, who met in February to arrive at a settlement in the matter."

Owaisi was campaigning for AIMIM’s 12 candidates who will be contesting from three wards in Modasa municipality elections scheduled to be held on February 28.
“Do you know what happened on September 29, 2008 in Modasa?” Owaisi asked as the crowd responded by saying “bomb blast”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Among the deceased was a 15-year-old boy named Jamal Ab Din Ghouri…a blast occurred near a mosque during the month of Ramzan in Modasa [in 2008] in which seven were martyred and over 100 were injured. I want to ask the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gujarat Chief Minister and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh people… I want to ask the cowards of Congress whether they will ever speak of Jamal,” asked Owaisi, claiming that till date the people responsible for the blast have not been brought to book.
“The families of the deceased persons in the blast still don’t know who killed their loved ones. I appeal to my mothers and sisters that we will not let another Jamal die in Modasa. Human life has a value, be it a Hindu, Muslim, or someone of tribal origin. If my name is Asaduddin Owaisi, then my life also has value because it has been granted to us in the Constitution by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am telling you to use your vote on February 28 and tell these oppressors who killed Jamal that our lives have value,” said Owaisi.
Referring to the protests in Modasa in January 2020 against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), Owaisi said, “I want to congratulate the people of Modasa for the manner in which they protested against the CAA, NRC and NPR. However, is it not true that many senior citizens in Modasa started hurriedly getting their birth certificates fearing that once the CAA comes into effect, they will have to show their papers? How long are you going to live scared? I spoke up in the Parliament against 306 MPs of the BJP saying that if they will bring the CAA, then we will protest. We, too, have the right to live without fear.”
Owaisi attacked Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) president Arvind Kejriwal during his 30-minute address. Without naming Kejriwal, he said, “There is a guy who has come to Gujarat with a bundle of brooms. When riots were taking place in Delhi, when Hindus and Muslims were killing each other, he went to Gandhi samadhi and sat over there. This guy kept quiet even when the Tablighi Jamat was given a bad name and accused of waging ‘Corona Jihad’ in Delhi.”
Alleging that the Congress has not given the post of mayor to a Muslim in Modasa fearing that it would upset their votebank, he said, “It is the Congress party that is responsible for India’s Muslims being weak, India’s Muslims lacking a political voice and India’s Muslims, Dalits and Advasis getting harassed. Modi ji has spent so much money in constructing the Statue of Unity but in the process, he also displaced over 75,000 tribal people from the place,” said Owaisi.
AIMIM senior leader Waris Pathan, the party’s Gujarat president Sabir Kabliwala and Gujarat general secretary Hamid Bhatti were also present on the occasion. “For 70 years, you have voted for Congress out of no choice but this time AIMIM has decided to contest in Modasa to address your woes,” said Pathan."

Commenting on the recent turmoil in the CBI, the editorial in Organiser says that the agency received a jolt when its two top-most officers were forced to go on leave. “On the one hand, when the bravery and contribution of police officers [is being] recognised in the form of [a] National Police Memorial for the first time, the reputation of the highest investigation agency with the tagline of ‘Industry, Impartiality and Integrity’ is under a cloud for many reasons,” claims the editorial.
“Not long ago, the Supreme Court had passed the scathing remark denouncing the premier investigation agency as a ‘caged parrot’ and ‘its master’s voice’. Though a new kind of collegium was constituted to appoint the directors, the committee ultimately would appoint the best from the people available. If your systems are not reformed with the changing times, and the same mindset and political favouritism continue to prevail from the entry point, you cannot expect individuals to display impeccable integrity once they reach the top. In this particular case, eventually not just the CBI but the credibility of all other agencies like the Central Vigilance Commission, Intelligence Bureau and Enforcement Directorate will also be questioned,” the editorial asserts.
According to Organiser, the critical question is “why all the threads related to the slugfest within the CBI lead to the Moin Qureshi Money Laundering Case”. “Are there signs of the deep state, indicating certain foreign interventions, in this particular case, as many experts believe?” it asks.
Modi for Sardarhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ahead of the inauguration of the Statue of Unity on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Organiser’s cover story on the grand Sardar Patel statue accuses the media of linking every initiative by the government to elections. The article claims: “It is a very unfortunate trend in the Bharatiya media that every initiative or action by the government is linked to elections. This is happening with the Statue of Unity too. It is linked with appeasing the Patidar community of which a section is agitating against the BJP in Gujarat.” The article that the critics conveniently forget that the idea of Statue of Unity was announced way back in 2010 when Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. “It was the same year when Shri Modi was entering the tenth year in the CM Office on October 7, 2010,” the article points out. Modi has not forgotten any great or small revolutionary or freedom fighter who contributed to the Independence struggle of Bharat and as CM, Mahatma Mandir was built at Gandhinagar, Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Verma Memorial was built at Mandvi-Kutch, broadband connectivity from the venue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s historic Congress session at Haripura near Surat was launched, the article claims.
Court vs belief
Against the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgment on the entry of women of all ages to the Sabarimala temple, an article in Organiser says that Hindutva is an ecosystem built upon the diversity of spiritual practices, each catering to different groups of people with different temperaments. “Sabarimala is one such unique spiritual tradition, which is now under threat by the forces that want to destroy diversity and promote homogeneity. If the wishes of the deity are not respected, if the traditions of the temples are violated, then we would forever lose this tradition and the access to the deity of Ayyappan in the form of Naishtika Brahmachari,” claims the article and adds that it will be a great loss to Hindu civilisation, and more importantly to the male and female devotees of Ayyappa Swami.
The article asserts that in the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgment allowing women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple on the grounds of equality and women’s rights, thousands of women in Kerala have taken to the streets to protest against the judgment. “In the light of this protest, it is natural to ask if the prohibition on the entry of women of reproductive age between 10 and 50 were discriminatory and an infringement of women’s rights, why have women across Kerala taken to streets to protest the removal of the prohibitions?” it asks."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his radio address to the nation Sunday, evoked the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and credited him with uniting India after partition. It was his timely intervention which helped save Jammu and Kashmir from ‘aggression’, PM Modi said. The prime minister appealed to the citizens, especially the youth, to participate in large numbers in the ‘Run for Unity’ being organised on October 31 to mark the birth anniversary of Patel.
In his monthly radio programme, Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi said, “If we are able to see a united India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity and strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel.”
He said this year, October 31 will be more special as the ‘Statue of Unity’, erected on the banks of the River Narmada in Gujarat, will be dedicated to the ‘Iron Man of India’. The structure, he said, is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US. “This is the world’s tallest statue. Every Indian will now be proud to see the world’s tallest statue here on Indian soil. Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too,” he said.

The Prime Minister also paid tributes to late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on her death anniversary, also on October 31. “October 31 also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too,” he said.
Explaining the reason behind observing ‘Infantry Day’ every year on October 27, the prime minister said the first Indian soldiers had set their foot in Jammu and Kashmir to take on intruders from Pakistan on this day.
Recalling the January 1947 Time magazine edition, he said Patel has been profiled and described as a person who possessed the capability to unite the country and ‘heal wounds’. He further said that Mahatma Gandhi also considered Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act.

“Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp and weft of unity on the axis of a single thread. He ensured the merger of all princely states with the Dominion of India. Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or for that matter the princely states of Rajasthan, if we are able to see a united India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity and strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel,” Modi said.
In his address, the prime minister praised the para-athletes, who had represented India in the Asian Para Games recently and said that their spirit to overcome challenges is inspirational. He also evoked India’s ‘golden history’ in hockey and said that the nation has contributed largely to the sport by giving a number of talented players like Dhyanchand, Balvinder Singh Sr, Dhanraj Pillai among others.
“India has a golden history in Hockey. In the past, we have won several gold medals and also won the World Cup once. India has given some great hockey players to the world,” PM Modi said.
Praising the tribal communities for their contribution to environmental conservation, the PM said, “The Adivasi community believes in peaceful co-existence but when they find the natural resources under threat, they are not scared to fight for their rights. It is not surprising that our very first freedom fighters were from the tribal communities.”
The prime minister also touched upon the issue of organic farming and appreciated northeast India’s initiatives in the field. “The northeast has immense natural beauty and the people here are extremely talented. This is one region, where organic farming has made progress. A few days earlier, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018, for promoting sustainable food system in the state. This award is given by Food and Agriculture Organisation, which comes the UN,” the PM said."

A resolution condemning the state government’s proposal to build a 211m Ram statue in Ayodhya — calling it “disrespectful to god, who is to be prayed to and not showcased” — was introduced at an ongoing ‘Dharma Sansad’, a gathering of over 1,000 sants in Varanasi, Monday.
Meanwhile, the government is contemplating opting for crowd-funding for the project, as was done for the ‘Statue of unity’ in Gujarat.
The three-day ‘Dharma Sansad’, organised by Dwarka Peeth’s Shankracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, is happening right after the VHP organised a ‘Dharma Sabha’ in Ayodhya to renew their demand for a Ram temple. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The ‘Dharm Sansad’ continued till late Tuesday evening, and a ‘dharmadesh’ (verdict) is likely to be announced Wednesday. 
Sources said the issue of the proposed statue was discussed several times at the event. A “ninda prastav” (resolution to condemn) was placed Monday by Rajendra Singh, and was supported by fellow participants.

Singh said that at a time when the whole country is talking about Ram temple, talk of a statue without a temple “is like cheating Ram bhakts”. 
Paramhans Das, another seer, said, “This is a gathering of non-political people. It is true that a resolution to condemn the proposal of Ram statue was brought in. They should construct the temple and bring the statue inside for prayers. In the open, birds would defecate on it.” 
He further said, “Humare Ram aradhya hain, pradarshan ke vishaya nahi hain…Yeh ninda prastav ko samarthan karte hain (Ram is a respectable figure for us, he is not for show. We support this resolution).” 
Additional Chief Secretary (Tourism) Avaneesh Awasthi said, “….We are as of now proposing to make it (the project) through crowd-funding.” 
He added that the government may fund the financial gaps in the project, which will not only include the Ram statue, but also a massive umbrella, a museum and beautification of the surrounding region. A consultant and artists will also be roped in. 
“…For BJP, Ram has become an event and the height of his statue is being calculated. No Hindu would approve of it,” said Congress state president Raj Babbar."

Leader of Opposition in Gujarat Assembly Paresh Dhanani was suspended from the House for the rest of the day on Wednesday by Speaker Rajendra Trivedi over his remark that the ruling BJP tried to “politically encash” the “pratibha (personality)” of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by making his statue using “bhangar no bhuko (iron scrap)”.
Strongly objecting to the remarks of the senior Congress leader, the BJP members demanded an apology from him, and urged the Speaker to suspend him. Acting on the treasury bench’s request, the Speaker suspended Dhanani for the rest of the day, after putting the motion into vote.
It began during Question Hour when Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who holds the portfolio of Narmada Yojana, was replying to a question asked by BJP MLA from Maninagar, Suresh Patel, on the number of people visiting the 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity in Narmada district."

After inaugurating the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya Colony in Narmada district last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a 45-minute-long speech. However, many felt that the PM, known for his oratory skills, was not at his best. Many said that the speech was not captivating and there was no political punch in it as expected against the Opposition. A government official said that probably political developments in Delhi and the opposition to the statue project by tribals could be weighing on the PM’s mind that led to his “below average” speech. However, a senior officer said, “I think considering the world-class occasion, inaugurating world’s tallest statue, the PM must have chosen not to attack anyone politically. I think the PM honoured the occasion.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The inaugural function of the Statue of Unity was attended by almost all the top BJP leaders in the state. While that is quite expected, it was noted that many leaders had also brought their wives along with them to witness the unveiling of the statue. While wives of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel were spotted in the front row, wives of many top bureaucrats, including Chief Secretary J N Singh, were also seen in attendance. “Yes, many officers’ wives had attended the inauguration function. In fact, the state government had encouraged the idea,” a senior IAS officer said."

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani Thursday said the people from across the globe who come to India to see the Taj Mahal will now visit the country to see the Sardar Vallabhbhai’s statue near the Narmada dam. Gujarat government is expecting 15,000 visitors to arrive every day to see the world’s tallest statue in the state.
“People used to come to India to see only the Taj Mahal, now they will come to see the Statue of Unity… We will also put up signboards in six foreign languages as people from across the globe will come to see the statue…,” said Rupani while talking about the project at the national executive committee meeting of FICCI here.
Inviting FICCI members to visit the Statue of Unity along with their family, the chief minister said, “It is our estimate that per day, 15000 visitors will come at the Statue of Unity.”

The aim is to reduce the travel time to various attractions located on both sides for tourists visiting Kevadia. In an extension inviting bids, SSNNL has stipulated October 27 as the last date of submitting proposals.
Officials said that the main purpose of this ropeway is to give tourists a chance to witness the scenic view of the dam, the statue as well as the reservoir which lies in between the Vindhyachal and Satpura mountain ranges and a view of the meeting point of the three states — Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
The ropeway, according to the proposal document of the SSNNL, also aims to provide tourists those who visit the Statue of Unity a “fast access” to the allied attractions like Cactus Garden. As per the SSNNL tender document, “The cactus garden and the Statue of Unity are situated on the opposite banks of Narmada River. Tourists those who want to visit the garden have to travel approximately 13.8 km from the Statue of Unity to get to the other side of the river. It takes about 40 minutes by road. The ropeway ride will hardly take about five minutes.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The proposed ropeway alignment will pass over the Valley of Flower, Unity Glow Garden, downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam and Cactus Garden along the distance of 1.2 km.
The lower terminal point (LTP) station or the entry point is proposed in the Jungle Safari parking area of 1,200 sq metres, which is adjacent to the old helipad located on a land that belongs to the SSNNL. The approximate distance from this location to Statue of Unity is 1.1 km, officials said.
The ropeway is expected to run at an elevation of 69.8 metres with five supporting towers, none of which will be in the water stream. Senior officials said that since both the proposed terminals of the ropeway are located on hillocks around the Narmada dam and the Statue of Unity, the overall height of the ropeway will be higher than the total height of the dam, which stands at 163 metres from the foundation level — 120 metres of which is above the land.
The Upper terminal point (UTP) station, or the exit point, is proposed on an SSNNL land on a hillock near cactus garden.
The department has invited “nationally acclaimed agencies operating in the field of aerial cable propelled automated passenger ropeways for design, construction, development, finance, operation and maintenance of the ropeway service”, offering a concession period of 30 years.
The bidder is required to possess experience in similar projects. “The bidder should have either owned, operated and managed or built and installed, operated and managed at least one CEN standard passenger ropeway system…,” it said.
A senior official added that the department is likely to approve only those ropeway systems that are imported as per European, Canadian or American code. “There has been a decision that no Indigenous system shall be accepted. Operation and maintenance of ropeway system shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendation of manufacturer of the equipment and as per relevant codes of practice.”
The terminal area of the ropeway will also include waiting rooms, queuing areas, public toilets, first aid room as well as paths for physically challenged and visually impaired persons."

(Express photo by Gajendra Yadav)
Starting out as a reluctant politician in the recent general elections, the cricketer-turned-BJP East Delhi Member of Parliament Gautam Gambhir is gradually finding his feet as a people’s representative. As is the case when he wears the hat of a cricket pundit, Gambhir, in his new avatar, hasn’t let political correctness dictate his public statements either. With the important Test series against South Africa just days away, speculation on M S Dhoni’s retirement rife, captain Virat Kohli’s side still in transition stage and Delhi’s Assembly elections expected early next year, the 37-year-old former India opener has a lot to talk about
SANDEEP DWIVEDI: When you retired from cricket, you seemed reluctant to join politics. What changed?
I was always hesitant about joining politics because it is very different from the field I come from. (Cricket) is black and white… One day I was sitting with my dad and we were discussing my future plans. I had just signed the commentary contract with Star Sports. He asked me if it (commentary) excited me… I was like no, it’s too boring for me. I told him that I don’t want to be someone who just talks about issues and then forgets about them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
SANDEEP DWIVEDI: What made you join the BJP? Were there other options as well?
Of course I had options. There were offers from other political parties as well. (Late) Mr (Arun) Jaitley helped me a lot in joining the BJP. He said that people like me should get into politics. The relationship between our families went back 30 years. He kept saying that I should get into politics, and that people like me could make an impact, given our energy and intent. So maybe that was one reason for joining the BJP. Then, obviously, the decisive leadership that the party offered was something that the nation needed. So that was probably another reason that I joined the BJP. But the biggest reason was Mr Arun Jaitley.

SANDEEP DWIVEDI: In his book, Paddy Upton, the former mental conditioning coach of the Indian team, made an interesting observation about you. He said that Gautam has lots of insecurities, and that he is ‘one of the most negative cricketers I have worked with’. But, at the same time, he goes on to say ‘in case I want to pick one guy for a big match, I will always pick Gautam’. After you won the Cricketer Of The Year award from the International Cricket Council, you said that ‘even this will not help work on my insecurities’. Can you elaborate?
The only complaint that I have with Paddy is that the timing (of his book) wasn’t right. I was campaigning when the book released. I was scared that people might take it up. It is out in the open that at that stage I would say that my insecurities are far greater than my securities. There is nothing wrong in it. People do feel insecure. It has a lot to do with one’s experiences. It is not that I used to feel insecure only with Paddy. Probably when I was 10 or 11 years old, I had to fight for every opportunity that I got. I had to fight when I was playing for under-14, for under-16, even the Under-19 World Cup. So it is the experiences that I have had throughout my career which made me insecure. But I look at insecurities in a positive way. It has kept me going and made me work even harder. I was never content with my performances. Even when I scored a 100 or 50 runs, I would crib about it in the dressing room… Insecurities have been a very, very positive thing in my life. I actually had a debate with Paddy on the negativity (comment)… I was never cribbing, I always wanted to hit more balls, take more catches. I was the first one to arrive for practice and the last one to leave… I used to feel that every failure could push me out of the team. I wanted to be a part of the team for as long as I could, to play for India as long as I could, and to be the best cricketer. Probably these were the reasons that made me insecure.
SANDEEP DWIVEDI: What kind of homework do you have to do as a politician?
I am trying to read a lot. I was never a big reader, I used to watch documentaries. So now I am trying to read as much as I can. I am trying to gain knowledge from my team as well. I have a very good team in place. I have got a researcher, a good political advisor. Obviously, I will gain from experience over a period of time as well.

SANDEEP DWIVEDI: In the commentary box, you are now talking about people that you played with, including M S Dhoni, and there is conversation about his retirement…
I feel that retirement is a very individual decision. Till the time you want to play you are allowed to play, but you do have to look at the future as well. I do not see Dhoni playing the next World Cup. So whoever is the captain (then), Virat or any one else, should have the courage to say so, that this player is not fitting into the scheme of things. It’s time for some of the youngsters to get groomed in the next four-five years, because ultimately it is not about Dhoni, it is about the country. It is not about Dhoni staying on for the next cricket World Cup, it is about winning the next cricket World Cup. You might want to give the opportunity to Rishabh Pant or Sanju Samson, any young cricketer… They should get the opportunity… I think personally, if you ask me, I think it’s time for Indian cricket to look beyond Dhoni.
MIHIR VASAVDA: As you took the political plunge, was it challenging to understand people’s issues, their expectations from you?
Initially, yes, it was a challenge. The constituency was very new to me. All my life I have lived in New Delhi, I have practised in New Delhi. I had hardly been to East Delhi. I was surprised that Feroz Shah Kotla (now renamed the Arun Jaitley Stadium) comes under my constituency. But you learn.
The first challenge was getting exposed to a lot of people. Earlier, I would have a small group of people around me. When you are a part of public life you are exposed to all kinds of people. It’s challenging but also exciting. I realised that as a sports person you can only bring smiles to people’s faces, but with politics, if you go in with the right intent, you can change lives.
SANDEEP DWIVEDI: On Twitter you come across as a very different person. You have had some very angry exchanges with Omar Abdullah and Shahid Afridi.
They (the Abdullahs) need to take responsibility for whatever is happening in Kashmir. This is a family that has ruled Kashmir for the longest period of time… Both the Abdullahs and the Muftis. I have been very clear on that front… I agree the (tweet) could have been a bit over the top, I am not denying that. But it hurts me a lot when a young Kashmiri doesn’t get opportunities. They stand on the roads and stones are thrown. That will hurt any Indian.
(On Shahid Afridi) Some fights do get personal and there is nothing wrong with that. It has been like that for a very long time. Sometimes it is nice to get personal with someone. I have had decent relationships with Pakistani players, off the field, but not with Shahid Afridi. So that is the reason we got personal. Now obviously he doesn’t play but you never know, he might just make a comeback. He will never retire… There is a bit of history to that (the relationship with Afridi), I am fine with that.
NIHAL KOSHIE: Since the BJP has come to power, there has been a sense of hyper-nationalism attached to issues related to Kashmir, Pakistan, cows etc. Are you comfortable with it?
For me nationalism is all about growth and development. Every youngster in the country, in every state, including Kashmir, wants opportunities. That is what nationalism is for me. Yes I do respect the national anthem, I will always respect it. I will always stand up for it. In a tweet I had said that there was nothing wrong in standing up for 52 seconds. But I am against polarisation, negative polarisation. Anything that divides the society on religious lines, the lynchings… I am absolutely against it . I think you cannot lynch people on the basis of religion. I have never endorsed it. For me India is one, and it will always remain one. Nationalism is everywhere, it is about treating your country like your mother… It is a feeling that you want your country to grow. I do not endorse hyper-nationalism.
NIHAL KOSHIE: Will you continue to speak about problematic issues in the future as well?
Why not? I am an Indian first, religion comes much later. I will always stand by what is right and what is wrong. There are two kinds of polarisation — positive and negative. Positive polarisation was a movement like the Anna Hazare movement and what happened after the Nirbhaya case. Anna Hazare taught us to fight against corruption. The Nirbhaya case taught us to talk about women security and safety. But lynching and dividing society are negative polarisation and I will never endorse it.
ABHINAV RAJPUT: You represent the East Delhi seat, which has been facing many issues — strikes by sanitation workers, teachers not getting salaries in municipal schools etc. The Ghazipur landfill site has crossed the height of the Qutub Minar, and the joke is that it is now competing with the Statue of Unity. How do you plan on tackling these issues?
I am already working on a lot of the issues that you mentioned. The MP fund that I get for my constituency will never be enough. I am already talking to corporates and asking them to introduce CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives in the region.
I have also spoken to everyone I know about the waste segregation issue. I know what it is to live around the Ghazipur landfill. The water that they drink, the air quality… I know what the families go through. Young kids have stomach issues, asthma, it is absolutely inhuman. I spoke to the Environment Ministry, the Prime Minister has taken note of the Ghazipur landfill issue. Things have started moving in a positive direction.
Education is a huge issue. There are six EDMC (East Delhi Municipal Corporation) schools in my area. They have poor infrastructure, they are in a shambles. Some corporates have decided to take up the schools and change the entire infrastructure, make it more kid-friendly. I am trying to do the best I can with help of corporates because the MP fund is very limited — Rs 5 crore will never be enough.
Compared to other constituencies, my constituency has a lot more issues. For waste management, we have already started working on compost machines. Also, there are three-four big malls in my area. If they can go plastic free… I have already distributed 30,000-40,000 bags. Whatever little I can do in my capacity, I will definitely do it. I promise that in my tenure there will be a solution to the Ghazipur landfill. I am not saying it will happen in six months or one year, but it will happen.
MALLICA JOSHI: Delhi elections will be held in a few months. What is the BJP’s plan for the polls?
I am too new… See, we can talk as much as we want about what our current Chief Minister has not delivered on. But, what we can bring to the table is also very important. I think this country is growing beyond negative politics. I think for me the most important thing is what the BJP needs to do, which is to tell people what they can bring to the table, and not what Mr Kejriwal has not achieved. So if you go to the people and tell them that this is what we can do, this is the positive politics we want to do, that can make an impact… That can change scenarios.Who wants to listen to negativity? People today know whether development is happening or not. Earlier, people would do little but show a lot more. But now if you don’t do things, I am sure people are going to hurt you badly.
ANANT GOENKA: Is there some good work done by Arvind Kejriwal that you see in the city?
He keeps talking about education. But I am not going to agree with what he says about tackling dengue or what he says about air quality. That is completely, absolutely illogical. The air quality has improved, but he has not taken measures for it. He promised so many things. We will have artificial rainfall, we will have vacuum cleaners on the road… He has hardly done anything. Where are the vacuum cleaners? Where is the artificial rainfall? Where?
On the dengue issue, the MCD has done a lot. I spoke to all the councillors. They have been working day and night on it. He (Kejriwal) can market himself as much as he wants, and he is doing it, but ultimately I am sure if we go to people with a positive thing, they will connect with us.
MALLICA JOSHI: Do you think free Metro and DTC bus rides for women, and 200 units of free electricity, will make a difference on the ground?
It’s a completely political move. Do you want Delhi to be helpless? You are making people helpless. If you can afford it, do you still want a free ride? It is only putting a burden on taxpayers. For four-and-a-half years you did not think of putting up CCTV cameras, and now you have given out tenders worth lakhs. Wasn’t women security important four-and-a-half years ago?
SANDEEP DWIVEDI: What do you have to say about Dhoni wearing the Army insignia on his wicket-keeping gloves?
See, it’s fine. If he enjoys it and if it comes from within, he is absolutely right in wearing it. But it should not be made into news. Honestly, I think, the Army doesn’t need any endorsement. The Army doesn’t need any marketing. I have never been in favour of honorary ranks (in defence forces) as well. I have been very vocal about it. People have given their sweat and blood to achieve that uniform. There is honorary everything, at least leave the defence services out of it…
Yes, M S Dhoni has done a fabulous job, going to Kashmir, serving in the Army, hats off to him. But I will not endorse people getting honorary positions in the defence forces.
PARVEEN K DOGRA: After winning the Lok Sabha polls, you tagged Arvind Kejriwal in a very angry tweet…
I said I was ashamed to have a CM like you… It was because of the pamphlet controversy. See, for me, every other controversy is fine. I remember when I went to file my nomination, Atishi (AAP East Delhi candidate against Gambhir) was there. I walked up to her and said all the best. I said may the best person win and that whoever wins should be good for the people of Delhi because they deserve it. We started having a conversation… Some people said you should not have a conversation. I said why should I not have a conversation. We could have ideological differences but there are no personal differences between us. The next day, of course, they tried to cancel my nomination. Fair. Probably that’s the rule of the game. Then there were FIRs filed against me… Fair enough, okay. That was fine because the court has to decide who is right and wrong. But the pamphlet controversy was something that no person can take. I have a family… In India, a media trial is very, very dangerous. I would never want anyone to tell my mother, my wife or my children that your father or your husband or your son has done something like this. That was hitting me under the belt. Probably that was the time that I had tweeted that I feel ashamed to have a CM like him.
RITU SARIN: You are making the Delhi elections a direct contest between the AAP and the BJP? What about the Congress?
We should not take the Congress lightly. It is a national party that has run the country for 70 years. But I personally feel that the loss of Mrs Sheila Dikshit has been a huge blow for the Congress in Delhi. She was a huge face in Delhi. I think it’s a fight between the BJP and AAP at the moment, but you can’t take the Congress lightly because it still has a legacy."

(Designed by Gargi Singh/The Indian Express)
What do young Indians want? Gully Boy and its protagonist offers an answer. Roaming the streets of Mumbai by night, Ranveer Singh’s Muraad, up-and-coming hip-hop star from Dharavi, picks up a can of red graffiti paint and writes on the wall: roti, kapda aur makaan + internet.
The internet in India is a playground of the young, a part of their self-definition. And it’s throwing up young influencers, who speak to their legions of followers in a hyper-kinetic lingo of memes and mash-ups, viral videos and goofy satire. This burst of self-expression blurs the boundaries of journalism and entertainment, television socials and comedy shows. For an audience that chooses TikTok videos over lofty editorials any day, this mash-up is the message. “This is a reaction to what’s been happening in mainstream media, where outside voices, or those that have satirical tones, are pushed out. The atmosphere is grim, earnest and it’s polarised. Second, more individuals are finding their voice and airing them on their chosen platforms. One day, you decide you want to start something, and it catches on. As an individual participating in democracy, there’s no greater right than this,” says writer and columnist Santosh Desai.
The reach and popularity of these young YouTubers have made them household names, with their numbers rivalling the TRPs of many mainstream news channels. Which is why Shah Rukh Khan turned to Bhuvan Bam to promote his last film Zero (2018). Khan became the first guest of Bam’s talk show, Titu Talks. The 13-minute video got more than 2 million hits. The BBC roped in Dhruv Rathee for a detailed ground report on Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. Rathee was also on Ravish Kumar’s show on NDTV India to dissect the current state of mainstream media. “They are talented, but they are also free of the shackles an organisation would impose on them. The internet is giving these youngsters a chance to be as big as a mainstream news channel in terms of reach,” says Saurabh Parmar, digital and social media consultant.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
They are hardly pioneers, though. The charge of the laugh brigade began during the run-up to the 2014 general elections, which threw up acts such as All India Bakchod and The Viral Factory. Not everybody is impressed by what can, at times, appear to be humour that skims the surface. “This is an underground movement at best. I don’t think they have the critical grounding, or gravitas needed for political or social satire. When I was doing Movers and Shakers (a late-night talk show in the late 1990s), we would not spare anyone, but we would do it with respect and civility,” says television actor and host Shekhar Suman.
With a new government in place, will the edge of criticism or satire be blunted? “I just hope that when they become bigger, they don’t adapt to the mainstream ecosystem,” says Parmar.

For instance, SRK turned to Bhuvan Bam to promote his last film, Zero.
Bhuvan Bam might be India’s biggest YouTuber, with 13 million subscribers, but he had not been invited to the biggest, fattest Indian wedding earlier this year (Akash Ambani with Shloka Mehta.) How did he then make his presence felt?
By dubbing footage of the star-cast of wedding guests with sarcastic commentary. The video showed parents (and Reliance owners) Nita and Mukesh Ambani welcoming guests with “Jai Jio”, the Ambanis cribbing about poor network, and a too-garrulous Big B being side-eyed by Jaya Bachchan. As humour went, this was neither too sharp, nor innovative but Bam took a #trending mega-spectacle and found a way to make it as familiar as the chaos and bickering of a wedding in a Delhi mohalla.
That’s not surprising, since Bam’s channel, BB Ki Vines, is really the story of a Delhi teenager, his parents and foul-mouthed friends. “I have not created these characters out of my imagination, they exist all around us,” says Bam. In videos shot in a barsati at his parents’ house in south Delhi, he speaks of slut-shaming and consent, the pressure of exams and dating, and the Indian obsession with fairness. All the characters are played by Bam. “Many students were sharing their anxiety on Instagram before the results. So I had to come up with an episode to let them know that results were not the end of the world,” says Bam, who recently headlined the YouTube India fan fest with director Karan Johar.
Bam is an accidental content creator. He was an aspiring singer in college, performing for free at small restaurants, belting out Bollywood covers and an occasional original song. “My first satire video was in response to a reporter’s coverage of the Kashmir floods in 2014. One thing led to another, and the first video where I introduced my character, BB, got huge traction in Pakistan, and then it became known in India,” says Bam, a graduate of Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University.
Right now, Bam is still riding the wave, though there is the pressure to deliver with every video. Since most of his audience is young, some barely in their teens, he is wary of didacticism. “There’s an inherent message in all my videos. I want them to think, but not bore them in the process,” he says.

He says he fears for the safety of his family and himself.
Dhruv Rathee’s “explanatory” videos are the logical culmination of the idea of a citizen as a journalist. Like many fact-checking websites, his channel began as a response to the spread of misinformation through social media, and seeks to counter what he sees as the mainstream media’s errors of omission. “I take whatever is trending, do a fact-check of sorts, and break it down. Because the mainstream TV media is not doing that. I don’t proclaim that I am an expert, but an informed presenter,” says Rathee, who is currently pursuing higher studies in Europe.
Many of his videos have been critical of the Modi government, from the controversy over employment data to the shady troll army, from questioning the intelligence failure that led to the attack in Pulwama, the several exposes around the Rafale deal, to the cost-benefit analysis of the new Statue of Unity in Gujarat. The videos are a mix of reportage, analysis and opinion. “I take my time with the research and fact-checking. Compared to TV channels, my response might be a bit delayed, but it will be comprehensive,” says Rathee, who is from Haryana and moved out of the country in 2012. Not surprisingly, he has been called a Congress supporter, an AAP cheerleader and an anti-national.
Rathee says he relies on websites like Factly.in, IndiaSpend.com, Factchecker.in, SMHoaxslayer.com and AltNews.in. He says his distance from India is not a hindrance. “Just like other news channels, I consult experts and ground reporters before doing a story. Of course, some videos have to be done on ground, so then I travel to India,” he adds.
In spite of his diligence, mistakes have crept in. “I have made five-six significant errors in the past year. People from the right wing have exaggerated these to put me down. Over time, I have made a few simple rules for myself: ‘Check any news for logical errors, check multiple sources before posting, always publish with source, mention when you speak an opinion. And if you do make a mistake, post a correction as soon as you realise it,” says Rathee.
He says he was always politically aware, but it was the Anna Hazare anti-corruption movement in 2012 that pushed him to inform himself. In the last five years, he says he has been driven by the unquestioning attitude of the television media. “The mainstream TV media still only attacks the Opposition. Why is the ruling party not being subjected to questioning and scrutiny?” Rathee asks. “It’s not about the BJP alone. It angers me ki hum sawal nahin poochh sakte,” he adds.
For a social-media personality, Rathee is tight-lipped about his personal life. He says he fears for the safety of his family and himself. His location and whereabouts have never been revealed. “It’s a genuine concern for me. The polarisation in our country is so extreme that you don’t really know what an outraged mob can do,” says Rathee.

(Photo by Ravyank Kapur)
Can a Dil to Pagal Hai song explain the sudden rise in profile of Yogi Adityanath? The answer is yes, if you are Ramit Verma. Other liberals might have foamed at their mouth, but the 27-year-old chose to see the change in attitude to the Hindu Yuva Vahini chief after the BJP’s massive victory in the 2017 UP elections through a melodious Bollywood song. A split screen illustrated Then and Now: news anchor Arnab Goswami in a full-bodied rant against the Gorakhpur leader, juxtaposed with him warmly extolling the new Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s virtues. In the backdrop, Lata Mangeshkar sings Arre re are ye kya hua in a cleverly put-together video for Verma’s Official PeeingHuman. It was shared 1.6 lakh times on Facebook, he says.
The channel has developed a fan base for its music-filled take on contemporary politics and its gentle satire that does not say too much. Verma instead brings his sharp video-editing skills to the game, supplemented by news clips, Bollywood tracks, memes and GIFs. To him goes the credit of making “Wah Modiji Wah” a pop culture code to puncture the bombast of political claims. “I always wanted to get into the creative field, but I was an introvert. I tried my hand at theatre, but I got rejected twice. I then started fiddling with my sister’s DSLR camera during my stint at Hansraj College. It became clear that the audiovisual format was the one for me,” he says. Born in Delhi, he got a Bachelor’s degree in commerce, dabbled in photography, picked up basic editing skills and even did a stint with Google in Delhi.
Over time, Verma felt the need to educate himself in politics. “I was interested but had zero knowledge. I wanted to bring about some change. I had my Rang De Basanti moment with the India Against Corruption movement. It was the first people’s movement I saw. But everyone got disillusioned, especially when the main beneficiaries turned out to be the RSS and the BJP,” he says.
But Verma’s involvement and fascination with politics continued with the 2014 Lok Sabha election. In 2015, he started watching news religiously. PM Narendra Modi’s speech in Toronto, Canada is what pushed Verma into making his first GIF, which he thought would go viral. “He was talking about renewable sources. After nuclear energy, solar energy, he said weed energy instead of ‘wind energy’. I had Tata Sky Plus, and I rewound the thing, and I heard it again — it was weed. I made a 16-second meme, which I was convinced would go viral. It didn’t,” Verma says.
The channel’s name was inspired by the famous lifestyle brand owned by a Bollywood superstar. “The name came to me when Salman Khan was acquitted in the hit-and-run case. As for the music, I have not seen any new Bollywood films, so I only remember songs from the films of the 1990s,” says Verma.
His initial work were mash-ups of Hollywood/Bollywood videos, Ramdev dancing, or Beyonce grooving to Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. “I created Official PeeingHuman in May 2015. Two years into it, I started making purely political and media-related content. I thought this format might resonate with people. Also, political satire and criticism was absent in the mainstream. I had the information to question those in power, so I thought why not make fun of them? If, while laughing at some simple, obvious things, one can make someone think, then why not?” says Verma.
He says he is gratified by the response of young people, many of whom engage with politics not through mainstream media but as entertainment. “Some tell me they used my videos in an argument with their parents and friends. I think the biggest impact my work has is that it keeps young people interested in political discourse,” says Verma. He says he is not aligned to any politically party, but believes in the right to criticise and question whoever is in power. He was threatened with legal action “by some leading TV channels”, he says. It led to some content being removed by YouTube from his channel. He shrugs it off. “News had become satire, so why not satirise it?”

“The idea is linked to the Bengali concept of an adda. Where people come, sit and discuss a matter in a very civilised manner,” says Poulami Nag, the face of Hothat Jodi Uthlo Kotha, a Bengali YouTube channel which picks up trending social and political topics, and breaks them down in a simple, factual way.
Most of the videos are set in the yellow balcony of an old Kolkata house, with Nag holding forth. In a year since the channel (which loosely means “Now that this has come up”) started, she has done videos on Bengal’s obsession with Boroline, mathematician Shakuntala Devi and Bengali writers. The run-up to the elections has seen Nag run segments on celebrities in political parties, the chances of the CPI(M) and the Congress; the battle in Begusarai and the confrontation between Modi and Mamata Banerjee. Very few videos are dedicated to the West Bengal chief minister.
“I wanted to do something of my own, when I moved back to Kolkata from Delhi. My friends and I thought we should do what we did every day, sit and talk about things—but on YouTube. We started with issues that people had heard of, but didn’t know enough about. We started doing this as a fact-finding, explanatory video format, but in a colloquial fashion,” says Nag, 26.
Born and brought up in Kolkata, Nag studied at Jaipuria College and subsequently embarked on a career in journalism. She has worked with publications like the Deccan Chronicle and Cobrapost in Delhi. “I was always very interested and aware of the political scene. I was an avid consumer of news,” says Nag. Although fluent in English and Hindi, the decision to have content in Bengali — there is a liberal sprinkling of English phrases and words — stemmed from a need to fill a void. “I couldn’t find any channel in the language, dispensing this kind of information. Which I found surprising, as Bengal is seen as an intellectual space,” says Nag.
Most of the feedback has been positive, and people have lauded the effort. There are the token trolls who attack the channel and Nag. “I get abused more because I am a woman. There are many abusive words used only for women, and I get them a lot. My physical attributes, my dark skin have been called out. I have been called ugly. But, I wonder, why do they watch the channel? They can stay away,” she says.

Vasava’s letter comes on a day when the state government’s general administration department sanctioned two circles of management with a strength of 201 personnel for the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority, or SoU Tourism Authority (SoUTA). The personnel will be responsible for the operation and maintenance, water supply, sewage lines, roads, parking, lights as well as the decorative lighting in the area of 25 sq metres of the Kevadia colony.

In his letter drafted in Hindi, Vasava has cited the example of Rajasthan, where the notification for the eco-sensitive zone has been withdrawn in the “interest of farmers and locals”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“In the name of the notification of the MoEFCC, government officials have begun interfering in the private properties of the tribals. The local tribals in Narmada have not been taken into confidence or given the understanding of the issue, which has created fear and mistrust among them. The locals are preparing for protests and some opposition parties are leveraging on the lack of communication between the government and the locals, inciting them against the government,” the MP stated.
Vasava has also urged Modi to withdraw the notification to restore “peace and order” in the lives of the locals. “The area around the Statue of Unity in Narmada district is fast developing due to the tourism projects. However, it is my humble request that the area should be removed from the purview of the eco-sensitive zone to allay the fears of the local communities and for the benefit of the tribals. It will also help mitigate the opposition of the tribals here.”

With the growing spotlight on Kevadia as a tourism circuit, the SoUTA has been introduced as a body with 201 stipulated vacancies at various levels of management to look after the future requirements of the town, including revenue, law and order, administrative, medical, town planning, fire and emergency services, solid waste management and sanitation. The SoUTA will be led by a CEO, who will be assisted by two deputy district collectors as well as officers for revenue, health, tourism, fire safety and town planning.

The first circle of SoUTA will include administrators for the Statue of Unity, Shreshth Bharat Bhavan, Gora bridge navigation channel, jetty service and overall maintenance of the complex. The second circle will include the administrators for all other projects around SoU, a statement issued by the government stated Wednesday.
Each of the two circles will have 112 employees, including two supervisory engineers, one executive engineer (civil) and executive engineer (electrical). As many as 61 existing officials from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) have been deputed at the SoUTA along with their offices. Close to 51 other officials will soon be inducted."

(File photo)
Without naming the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), senior Congress leader Anand Sharma Monday said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 1948 order banning the organisation should be placed at the foot of his gigantic ‘Statue of Unity’, to be inaugurated soon in Gujarat’s Narmada district.
Speaking to media here, he noted that the move would tell people what the first home minister of the country thought of “them” (RSS).
“They (RSS-BJP) do not have heroes of their own….So they are making the Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel and that too, has been made in China,” the Congress leader said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“There is a written order by Patel in 1948 about banning, following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi…the same order should be placed at the base of the statue, so that the country will get to know Patel’s thoughts about them,” he said.
Though the senior Congress leader did not name the RSS, he apparently referred to the ban on the organisation following Gandhi’s assassination, which was later lifted.
Sharma also accused the BJP of conducting a massive “cover-up operation” in the Rafale deal.
“There is a massive cover-up operation going on to hide the Rafale scam and that is why we are appealing the Supreme Court to put a seal (place in a sealed cover) on all the files and notings related to the deal,” he said.
The former Union minister also questioned the decision to make National Security Advisor Ajit Doval head of the newly formed Strategic Policy Group instead of the cabinet secretary.
“With this decision, the cabinet secretary, three services chiefs, defence secretary, foreign secretary, revenue secretary, finance secretary and chiefs of IB and RAW have come under the NSA, which is a political appointment,” he said.
During Doval’s tenure, “even a country like Maldives has gone out of India’s influence” and “everyone knows about his achievements regarding Pakistan”, Sharma said.
“It is a wrong decision and in the larger interest of the country, the security, defence, governance, administration, the cabinet secretary, three services chiefs, chiefs of IB and RAW cannot be subordinated to a political appointee,” the Congress leader said.
On the #MeToo movement and allegations of sexual harassment by some women journalists against Union minister M J Akbar, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claims to be concerned about women’s safety, should have reassured the country on the issue.
“His (Modi’s) silence is unacceptable,” Sharma added."

(Bhupendra Rana )
Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel inaugurated the work of concrete foundation raft of the Statue of Unity to mark the 65th death anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Tuesday. Taking a moment to thank Narendra Modi-led NDA government for clearing the state government’s request for installation of 30 sluice gates on Narmada Dam to raise its height to 138.68 meters, Anandiben said that Sardar Patel would be “proud” that the BJP has fulfilled his dream of constructing the Narmada Dam for the benefit of farmers.
Anandiben offered her tributes to Sardar Patel at the venue, bailey bridge constructed for the purpose of transporting construction materials. She said that the extension of the height of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam will benefit farmers even on the “borders of Pakistan”. The CM added, “I have inaugurated the foundation raft concrete work of the Statue of Sardar Patel, which was envisioned by Narendrabhai (Modi), as the world’s tallest statue. This work will now go on uninterrupted for six days to complete the concreting of the raft. We are positive that the entire statue will be completed within the next two years or so.”
Anandiben also said that the work of installation of 30 sluice gates over the Narmada dam would also be complete by next year, raising the height of the dam from 121.92 meters to 138.68 meters. She credited the prudence of the Modi-led NDA government for clearing the state government’s eight-year-old plea. “The work of the installation of the gates is on. Once complete, it will ensure that water will be supplied right until the border of Pakistan. Currently, we have already ensured that Kutch receives water. This dam, commissioned in 1961, had been Sardar Patel’s dream and he will be proud that the BJP has made his dream come true. We petitioned the UPA government for eight years since 2006, but it took Narendrabhai only 17 days to clear the file when he assumed office of the Prime Minister,” Anandiben said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The raft foundation of the Statue of Unity is located on the hillock Sadhu Bet, about 3 kms downstream from Narmada Dam. SS Rathod, director, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), said, “From the time of the inauguration at the hands of Anandiben, the raft foundation work will continue round the clock for six days. Close to 4,500 cubic meters of concrete will be compressed with ice in a process that follows precision so as to ensure that there is no heat in the mixture.” The 3-meter deep raft foundation will now see round-the-clock concreting for the next six days to ensure safe bearing capacity of 2,300 KPA, officials said. Rathod added that the museum and memorial park would be completed before the construction of the feet of the statue begins, sometime next year. He added that this phase of the project will also complete the construction of the main bridge connecting the statue to the Narmada bank as well as the road along the bank leading to Sadhu Bet.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The contract for the project was handed over to L&T in October 2014. Its estimated cost is about Rs 2,980 crore. The project includes an exhibition hall, audio-visual presentation on the life of Sardar Patel and a memorial park."

(Bhupendra Rana)
After many banners across Narmada district for the government-sponsored Ekta Yatra to celebrate the completion of Statue of Unity were torn and defaced allegedly by agitating tribals, the local administration have replaced them with posters carrying the picture of tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda. Police personnel have also been deployed close to the banners to prevent any attempt to damage them.
Notably, unlike the old ones, the new posters carry a bigger image of the tribal leader followed by smaller images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. Besides the image of the tribal leader, the banners have captions reading ‘Adivasi Freedom Fighter’, ‘We heartily welcome the Ekta Yatra’ along with images of places of tourism in Gujarat.
When asked if there was a deliberate decision to replace the torn banners with those having the image of Birsa Munda, Narmada Collector R S Ninama said, “New posters that have been put up were made and sent by the agency in Gandhinagar (Gujarat Tourism). We did not decide it.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

On Thursday, The Indian Express had found that huge posters with photographs of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and the Statue of Unity were blackened or torn at several places along the Ekta Yatra route. However, the government’s measure seems to have failed to pacify the tribals as new posters were also found damaged with Birsa Munda’s image remaining intact. The government has not made any arrest or detention in this regard.
Meanwhile, ahead of the unveiling of the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Patel, 22 village sarpanchs from areas around the statue in Narmada district have written an open letter to Prime Minister Modi urging him to skip the unveiling ceremony on October 31, saying that he won’t be welcomed by the residents of Kevadiya Colony on ‘their land.’
“When we are still struggling to avail basic infrastructural facilities for schools, hospitals and drinking water, you decide to spend crores of rupees for the construction of a statue and now again for the inaugural event. With a heavy heart, all of us villagers are telling you that we won’t welcome you on our land in our district,” the letter to PM Modi read.
In the letter, the village chiefs have said that for the tribal population “land-farm, water and forest are the natural elements worth worshipping” which get exploited and destroyed during the course of such “ambitious developmental projects”. “It pains us to look at what you have done with our land and river with first the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and now with the Statue of Unity,” the letter read.
“With first the Dam, a number of people were rendered homeless and jobless. And now with this ambitious project of yours we can’t even fathom the number of people who have and who will lose their livelihoods and homes.”

They even raised concerns over insufficient rainfall and unavailability of water for irrigation and drinking purpose to people in Narmada district. “Being so close to the river and the Sardar Sarovar Canal, we should be the first to avail benefits of drinking water and water for irrigation, but we are yet to avail it. Our needs like such are not prioritised and when we raise our voices you send police to detain us,” it added.
The sarpanch of Waghadia village in Kevadiya Colony, Govind Tadvi, said, “Many villagers were displaced when the Narmada Dam was constructed and now for the statue. From our village 100 per cent land have been acquired for the project. The administration offered us compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh, but we refused to accept it. No amount of money can compensate the hard work put into building a house and returns that a farmland can produce in a lifetime. Outsiders have been called to set up stalls, while our source of livelihoods are destroyed in the name of development.”"

Singh on Thursday held a meeting of party general secretaries to plan for Narendra Modis forthcoming rallies in Uttarakhand,Ranchi and Varanasi along with the partys original plan to hold Lok Sabha constituency wise public meetings by senior leaders to mobilise party cadres for the 2014 elections.
Singh also was learnt to have instructed party general secretaries to contribute to the Run for Unity being organised by the Citizens for Accountable Governance (VAG) to promote Sardar Patels Statue of Unity project undertaken by  Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust under the chairmanship of partys prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Gujarat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
We have been asked to contribute to the organisation of Run for Unity across the country, confided a party general secretary about Singhs instructions to them in their first meeting after the conclusion of the assembly elections on Wednesday. 
When the trust is inviting NGOs,schools,colleges and others to participate in helping organise it,why not BJP, said a source in the party when asked about BJPs participation in the event.
The move holds significance in the wake of the recent tussle between the BJP and Congress over the legacy of Sardar Patel. The Run for Unity is not only expected to revive the debate but will also help the BJP undertake mobilisation of youth across the country through it.
The run has been planned for December 15,the death anniversary of Sardar Patel,and will be organised simultaneously at more than 565 locations across the country ostensibly to signify the 565  princely states unified by Patel after Independence."

Days after The Indian Express reported the state government’s decision to relocate hundreds of crocodiles from Pond 3 and 4 of the Narmada Dam in Kevadia Colony to clear path for the sea plane terminal connecting the Statue of Unity, the Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti (PSS) on Saturday served a legal notice to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest & Head of Forest Force (HoFF) of Gujarat as well as the chief secretary of the Government of Gujarat to stop the translocation, calling it “drastic and mindless action”.
The notice, which has also been sent to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, called the decision of the state government a “short-sighted (one) with long term impacts”. It also questioned the necessity of the said translocation and demands that it must be made known who made the decision and the consultation sought before executing the translocation of the crocodiles. “On what scientific and technical bases and supervision this action is undertaken? The drastic and mindless action of the Forest Department will result in destruction and degradation of the habitats of many species and undermine the multiple values and ecological services of nature. Let us not overlook the needs and habits of the crocodiles and other food-web species for some selfish, human-centric ends.”

The notice urged the recipients to reconsider their decision and follow the guidelines of the Wildlife Protection Act to preserve the crocodile species. It stated, “The purported reason given (for the translocation of crocodiles near the world’s tallest statue) is “Tourist Safety” but most likely this is being done for the proposed ‘Seaplane Project’. We strongly believe that translocation of crocodiles will cause further problems for this nationally vulnerable Schedule I species and result in multiple issues within the area for different stakeholders, including the authorities concerned.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The notice further stated, “In absence of the known number of crocodiles in the present Lake 3 & 4, it is not possible to claim a crocodile-free water body. Moreover, there is also the possibility of crocodiles entering the dykes from adjoining water bodies that are at the distance of 18-20 km from the Narmada Dam and the main river course.”
Raising concern over the arbitrary translocation of crocodiles close to their breeding season, the notice stated, “The government’s decision to incarcerate and relocate crocodiles from their natural habitat is against the principles of ‘The Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972’. Especially such an act by the Forest Department which very well knows that this period is the breeding season of the crocodiles raises questions on their role in the management of wildlife and its habitat. More significantly, the importance of this species is illustrated by the multiple legal and policy efforts which have been developed by the Government of India to protect the crocodile’s population. Any activity which is against the survival of the highly protected species without having been approved by the State Wildlife Board and National Wildlife Board and the Government of India is patently illegal.

The state government will set up Gujarat State Yoga Board to promote yoga in a scientific manner among people in order to create a “healthy” Gujarat, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced at the celebration of the fifth International Yoga Day in Ahmedabad on Friday. The state-level yoga day programme was held at Sardar Patel stadium in Ahmedabad in the presence of Rupani and Governor O P Kohli.
Emphasising on this year’s theme, ‘Yoga for Heart’, Rupani said it helps keep the heart healthy and cures various related ailments.
He urged people to perform yoga daily and not restrict it to a single occasion for physical and mental well-being and to bring about a positive change in one’s life.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He expressed happiness over 1.50 crore people across the state joining him in the International Yoga Day celebrations. Over 1.50 crore people participated in the International Yoga Day events held at 50,000 locations across Gujarat, said a press release.
Recalling the tradition of yoga in the country, Governor Kohli said it is India’s gift to the world. “Yoga is the means of connecting the body to heart, the heart to soul and the soul to the God…”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi too addressed the people in the stadium through videoconferencing from Prabhat Tara Ground in Ranchi.
Ahmedabad Mayor Bijalben Patel, Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Secretary R C Meena, Collector Vikrant Pandey and Commissioner of Youth Services and Cultural Activities Jenu Devan were also present on the occasion.
In the evening, Rupani performed sandhya yoga on the premises of the Statue of Unity in Kevadia colony along with saints of various Hindu and Jain sects.
Previously, Kevadia colony had hosted yoga day celebrations near the unfinished statue of Sardar patel, however, after its inauguration in October last year, the tourist site hosted the event for the first time Friday. The Gujarat government had special plans to celebrate the yoga day with officials of various government departments like forest, district administration and SSNNL joining the celebrations at the Kevadia colony.
This year, yoga day celebrations were held on the premises of around 150 places of historical and religious importance, including Rani Ki Vav step-well in Patan, Ambaji temple in Banaskantha, Somnath temple in Gir-Somnath, Sarkhej Roza in Ahmedabad, Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar and Lothal archaeological site in Ahmedabad district.
Along with common people, personnel attached with the Indian Coast Guard, Border Security Force and Indian Air Force also performed various ‘asanas’ in different parts of state.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(ANI)
Ever since he became prime minister, Narendra Modi has demonstrated a predilection for hosting international leaders in Ahmedabad. In 2014, it was the Chinese President Xi Jinping, in 2017 the Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and in 2018, Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was the arrival of the US President Donald Trump and the gargantuan show mounted on Monday in Modi’s old stomping ground as chief minister of Gujarat that has given rise to a belated suspicion that what we are witnessing might be a new style of politics. And that it may have something to do with the city.
Before I take this idea further, a little history: Ahmedabad was founded in 1411 as the capital of an independent Gujarat Sultanate but fell to Delhi under Akbar. It was an important trading and manufacturing hub and local merchants were a major source of finance for the Mughals in their expensive wars. Given this background, one can suggest that putting Ahmedabad before Delhi on Trump’s itinerary symbolises a reversing of priorities with money and entrepreneurship taking precedence over politics and conquest.
Editorial: Modi and Trump seek to elevate the bilateral relationship to a higher levelhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another way of looking at it is a levelling of the local and the national. And yet another related facet is the substantial population of Gujarati NRIs in the US, an important constituency for Trump in an election year. Take all these factors together and you have a city that is simultaneously local, national and global, a fluid entity connected both to the hinterland and yet on its own in the world.
In 2001, when Modi took over as CM, Ahmedabad had a provincial reputation at the lower end of the country’s 10 most populous cities. Today, it has climbed the list to the fifth place, mainly as a result of its doubled size. A spanking new 76-kilometre highway runs around the expanded city limits, 11-kilometre concrete banks run down the riverfront, an existing hospital is being turned into “Asia’s largest” health tourism hub, a Gujarat International Finance Tech-City has been built to specifications that are “twice the size of Paris’ La Defense and eight times more built up than the London docklands”. A giant conference centre sits out on the baked ground in Gandhinagar and nearby Surat is building the world’s largest diamond bourse.
Opinion: Trump’s India visit indicates that bilateral relations are set to deepen to mutual advantage
Ahmedabad’s makeover was not unconnected with the programme of accelerated urbanisation adopted by India post 1991 with the launch of programmes like the Rs 50,000 crore Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and indeed many projects had been started before Modi’s chief ministership. But the speed, the emphasis on scale and the aesthetic sensibility driving the enterprise seemed to emanate directly from Modi.
As prime minister he has further demonstrated his interest in prestige projects such as the bullet train, a similar aesthetic style for public places (flat tiled ground in muted tones with no cover or distinguishing or wild natural feature). And there is a consistent and determined emphasis on scale. It is there in the 182 metre “Statue of Unity” of Sardar Patel and it was in his closing speech at the Namaste Trump event.
Even while the crowd was getting restive, he determinedly spoke about the “biggest sanitation programme” underway in India and the “biggest solar power programme” and linked these to the satellite programme, the deletion of old laws and passing of new laws with regard to maternity and transgenders. The intention to project an image of progressive modernity and immensity was clear: It was there in the reference to gigantic infrastructure projects and in the masses of people or pin heads visible on television screens, all gathered in the world’s ‘largest cricket stadium’ (but of course!).
It is easy to dismiss these various features as indications of megalomania but it would be a mistake. In fact, in a world driven by a neoliberal agenda with its stress on privatisation, market-driven economic growth and competition, nations compete to attract transnational funds through their cities. Over the last half century, cities across the world have adopted various strategies to stand out to tourists and corporate investors, the spectacle (in the form of events or architecture) being one of them. The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, billed as Europe’s “tallest cantilevered observation wheel” was launched in 2000 and attracts 3.75 million visitors annually. Following the lead of the developed West, three decades ago, Asian cities too transformed their cityscapes through the construction of mega projects.”
What is noteworthy is the particular way in which the provincial, the national and the global are repeatedly combined in Modi’s messaging. Let me describe this by mentioning a few elements of style picked out from publicity brochures for Ahmedabad’s urban beautification projects and at events mounted for international visitors. There is an aerial view of coloured lights ringing the renovated Kankaria Lake. There are many pictures of sailboats and deck chairs so much so that water is brought from the Narmada over a distance of 200 kilometres to feed the dry Sabarmati River. Embroidered umbrellas and swirling multi-hued skirts from Kutch have been in evidence at visits by international guests. At the Trump event, a line of camels was in place and at least one of the mounts was seen repeatedly mimicking a salaam like a dancing doll. So far, one has noticed a deliberate design in Modi’s moves. What is not clear is who exactly is this elaborate spectacle designed for?

Addressing a rally at Rewari in Haryana,Modi appealed to the people of the country to help build the ‘Statue of Unity’,in memory of the ‘Iron Man of India’.
“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a farmer and he was born in Gujarat. He played a vital role in uniting the country. But in the last few years,Patel,known as the ‘Iron Man of India’,has been forgotten,” Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Gujarat Chief Minister said,”I wish the ‘Statue of Unity’ should be two-time taller than the Statue of Liberty in the US.”
“I want cooperation from countrymen in its making. I do not want cannon or sword. I want pieces of iron used in the fields while farming,” he said,adding “the project would take four to five years to complete”."

However,the delegation,headed by finance minister Nitin Patel and comprising three MPs,six MLAs,a mayor,a zila panchayat chairman and senior government officers from Gujarat,interacted with various social organisations here seeking their support for the project and also held a workshop related to the project with BJP workers and members of various NGOs. 
The 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is coming up on an island on Narmada river at a cost of Rs 2,074 crore. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To garner public support for the project,a ‘Run for Unity is being organised at more than 565 places across the country on December 15 by Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,formed under chairmanship of Narendra Modi. 
Patel told The Indian Express that his officials had sought time from the UP Governor as well as the Chief Minister for a meeting so as to solicit their moral cooperation for Run for Unity and Statue of Unity project. 
However,he said,the Governor was reportedly not in city while the Chief Minister had a packed schedule. 
An official accompanying Patel confirmed that a senior Gujarat government officer had sought appointment from the UP CM to meet the delegation 15 days ago. 
Patel denied any political significance of Statue of Unity project for the BJP. Narendra Modiji had announced this project before the Assembly elections in 2012, he said.

The occasion was the inauguration of a renovated memorial for Patel and Modi was invited as a guest in his capacity as chief minister on a turf controlled largely by the Congress.
But Modi spared no attempt to make his point.
Is desh ko hamesha ek gila-shikva rahega,ek dard rahega. Har Hindustani ke dil me ek dard rahega. Kaash Sardar saab hamare pehle pradhan mantri hote,toh aaj desh ki taqdeer bhi alag hoti,desh ki tasveer bhi alag hoti (This country will always have one regret. Every Indian will have this pain in his heart. Had Sardar Patel been our first Prime Minister,then the face and the destiny of the country would have been different), he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also said Patel is an inspiration to fight Maoism and terrorism and to bring youth who have gone astray back into the mainstream. 
Modi,who will lay the foundation of the 182 m Statue of Unity two days later at the Sardar Sarovar dam site on the Narmada river,on the birth anniversary of Patel,has been claiming that the Congress has failed to give Patel his due.
The Congress,on the other hand,has been criticising the Modi government saying it had not given any funds for the memorial. The Centre has given Rs 17 crore and  Union Mines Minister Dinsha Patel is the president of the memorial.
In his speech,Singh called Patel secular and named Mahatma Gandhi,Jawaharlal Nehru,Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as some leaders who did India proud.
Singh said that while Nehru and Patel had differences,their points of agreement were far larger in number. He quoted Patel as having said that,It has been my good fortune to be advising Nehru on the issues nagging administration and organisation.
Faith in Indias unity,a secular and broad vision,feelings for the poor and weak,tolerance and respect for those who are ideologically different from us – I feel that today the people present here would agree that these are some values which are lacking in our country today. Which makes it necessary for us to pause at intervals and recall the grand ideals on which our country was founded, said Singh.
The PM also said he was proud to belong to the Congress of which Patel had been a leader.
Earlier,Modi was seen attempting to make conversation with a relatively cold Singh who was seated on his right. 
Modi arrived at the venue on time at 5 pm and took a tour of the museum with Union Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel.
Singh arrived at 5.25 pm and joined him at the museum. Referring to the late arrival of the PM,Modi said: There is a shortage of time. It was necessary for the honourable Prime Minister to go to Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan before coming to the Sardar Patel Smarak. 
Modi was visibly angry when Dinsha Patel corrected a detail in his speech where he had referred to Sardar Patels passing a resolution in the Ahmedabad Municipality on womens reservation in 1919. I would like to correct the chief minister that while what he said about the resolution is correct,it was not in 1919 but in 1926, Dinsha Patel said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

His vitriolic derision for the Congress,its leadership and Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that came to fore indicated the future tone and tenor of BJPs election campaign. While his open derision for Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan was at full display when he addressed Goa BJP workers convention in the evening,he indicated that he will work towards establishing a rival icon of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. For this purpose,he said he was going to erect worlds largest statue  Statue of Unity  of Sardar Patel,an icon Sangh Parivar highlights to undermine Nehrus contribution to Indian democracy,with contribution from each and every village across the country to commemorate Patels role in unifying India after Independence. 
The spirit is kar-sewa for a Statue of Unity with contribution from each village across the country to commemorate Patels contribution towards Indian unification. It will be a befitting and respectful homage from each village whose contribution will be an acknowledgment of the unity achieved by Patel, said party general secretary Murli Dhar Rao about his impression of Modis announcement.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modis speech in the executive and later at the Goa BJP workers convention had the theme of sowing a popular hate and resentment against the Congress leadership and its government in his role as election campaign committee chief to reap its harvest during the Lok Sabha elections. We will leave no stone unturned for Congress mukt Bharat nirman, was Modis theme during his addresses. A Congress mukt Bharat is solution to all problems facing the country, he thundered amid cheers from BJP workers. 
He ridiculed Congress advertisement on Bharat Nirman. Look at their shamelessness. They ask people to believe Bharat Nirman par haq hai mera,but I think Bharat nirman par shaq hai mera, he said. He recounted his recent public encounter with the PM at last weeks chief ministers conference on internal security to highlight how he challenged the alleged soft policies of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh against Naxalism. 
He also ridiculed Congresss coalition compulsion excuse for not being able to take bold decision asking whether former external affairs minister S M Krishnas error in reading out from the speech of another country at an international fora was also because of coalition compulsion. He came down against the alleged economic mismanagement by the PM. 
Modi,who is a BCCI member and kept mum during the IPL spot-fixing scandal,ridiculed Law Minister Kapil Sibal for his proposal to frame a law to curb this practice,asserting that Sibal didnt even know that the Centre had no authority to frame a law on sports as it was states prerogative.
NDA only credible alternative,BJP the vehicle: Resolution
The political resolution adopted by the BJPs national executive at Goa on Sunday resolved to throw this most corrupt (Congress-led UPA) government lock,stock and barrel and asserted the BJP-led NDA as the alternative.
In the long list of crimes committed against the people of India by the Congress in the last four years,three stand out: obnoxious corruption; degradation of economy; and a malignant assault on the federal spirit of our polity, read the resolution moved by former party president Nitin Gadkari. 
The resolution,which was adopted after interventions from Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan and Goa CM Manohar Parrikar,among others,blamed defective structure of leadership within the UPA for alleged misgovernance. PM Manmohan Singh is not the real leader of this government. He is merely in office,not in authority. True power vests with UPA chairperson Sonia Gan-dhi,who has the last word. For its future,the Congress looks towards the heir apparent,her son, said the resolution. 
The nation has been driven back to the edge of an abyss. In such a crisis,the defeat of the UPA is not merely a partisan wish,but a national responsibility. People have decided to kick out the UPA and welcome the NDA, said the resolution,reminding that the BJP-led NDA is the only credible alternative to a defunct UPA and described the BJP as the vehicle for bringing this resolved into reality.
Meanwhile,party spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said BJP will launch a jail bharo andolan from June 17 to June 22. ENS"

Inviting the US industry to invest in Gujarat, calling it an ideal investment destination, Rupani said that Gujarat’s economy has rebounced after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Using power consumption as the indicator, Rupani said, “I am happy to share that on August 29, 2020, our power consumption was 5% more than that consumed the same time last year. This clearly shows that the economy has re-bounced and is steadily back on growth curve.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The USISPF is a non-profit organisation formed in 2017 with the primary objective of strengthening the US-India bilateral & strategic partnership and enabling business & governments to collaborate. The summit comes months before Gujarat is due to host the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit next year.
Rupani also announced that a senior nodal officer would be appointed from his office to facilitate American companies to partner with Gujarat. The pharmaceutical sector saw special thrust as Rupani called upon US companies to partner with Indian companies to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API).
He also invited financial service sector to Gujarat citing the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar, which he said was the country’s “first operational smart city” and International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) offering world class infrastructure.
For the defence sector, Rupani said that while US had the expertise in defence manufacturing, Gujarat has the eco-system. “This ecosystem is supported by our aerospace and defence policy,” he said.
“For us a peaceful social environment is equally important,” said Rupani as he spoke of Gujarat having the world’s largest cricket stadium. “Just like you, we also have the Statue of Unity, standing tall on the banks of the Narmada river,” Rupani told the summit.
With keynote speakers like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs minister S Jaishankar, Commerce & Industry minister Piyush Goyal, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Communication & Information minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Army chief Bipin Rawat, Amabassador to the US Taranjit Sandhu, US Vice-President Mike Pence, and US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross at the summit, Rupani was the only Chief Minister from India who was invited to address the same.
“Gujarat presents great opportunities to US companies and is also developing a robust infrastructure facilities for pharmaceutical sector in the form of a Bulk Drug Park in Bharuch and a Medical Devices Park in Rajkot district,” an official release from the state government quoted Rupani as saying, while addressing the summit.
While asking US companies to partner with Gujarat to improve market access to the artisans in tribal areas through digital education, Rupani also invited companies like Cisco to partner with the government in the next wave of digital transformation.
On investment opportunities in Gujarat, Rupani highlighted the recently released new Industrial Policy of Gujarat with provisions such as relocation benefits, besides investor-friendly measures such as delinking incentives from the GST regime and land on a long-term lease.
“To promote a vibrant startup ecosystem, CM proposed a formalised startup engagement program between US and Gujarat in areas such as semiconductors, electronics and e-vehicles,” the release said.
The CM also expressed readiness for collaboration in life sciences, defence sector, petrochemicals and clean energy, besides warehousing and logistics; and pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors.

Vasava, who also leads the BJP party’s tribal cell in the state, has asked the sarpanches to use the upcoming gram sabhas in the villages to pass resolutions against the government order.
In a letter to the sarpanches of 121 villages of the “eco-sensitive zone” in Narmada, Vasava has reminded the tribal communities of the rights bestowed upon them by the Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 or PESA, a law enacted by the Government of India for ensuring self-governance through traditional gram sabhas for people living in the Scheduled Areas of India as per Schedule V of the Constitution.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In his letter, Vasava has said, “The gram sabhas are coming up in your respective villages between December 28 to February 6… The grave issue facing us as of now is the inclusion of the villages in the eco-sensitive zone. You must remember that the government has granted you the rights to protect your properties, jungles and other possessions as indigenous communities under Schedule V of the Constitution as well as the special PESA Act. The state government, by the way of the central government notification to include the area under the eco-sensitive zone, is trying to establish its title on your lands. I trust that you will use the power that the PESA Act gives you to pass resolutions in your respective villages by taking into confidence the villagers to oppose this government move.”

Vasava’s letter comes a day after BJP MP from Bharuch, Mansukh Vasava, also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking revocation of the notification and “releasing” Narmada district from the eco-sensitive zone. The area has seen protests from villagers since the district administration began sending notices to the gram panchayats for the implementation of the notification, which involves the inclusion of the state government as a co-owner of the village lands on revenue records."

It will be nearly 3 kms from the proposed 182-metre statue,which will come up at Sadhu Bet hillock.
Locals,who had attended the ceremony of the inauguration of the statue,said state BJP leaders including the then CM Keshubhai Patel were among those who attended the function. The Supreme Court (SC) recently allowed the dams height to be increased to 90 metres from the existing 88 metres. Before that,in February 1999,the SC had given green signal to raise dam height to 88 metre from 80 metre. Thousands of locals had gathered for the function.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A visitor from Vadodara,Harsh Rana,who went to see the overflowing dam along with his family members,said he was glad to see Sardar Patel statue at the dam site.
As Chief Minister Narendra Modi plans to build the worlds tallest statue of Sardar Patel near Narmada dam,his senior,L K Advani had paid tributes to Sardar Patel more than a decade back at the dam site. This is no less than a tribute to Sardar Patel,though the proposed 182-metre statue will help spread the name of Gujarat and Sardar Patel all over the world and will attract tourists here, he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Meanwhile,the work on the Statue of Unity is expected to start with the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) having floated tender for the same,the last date of application for which is August 29. The Rs 2,000-odd crore project is expected to be finished in four years,officials working on the project said."

He was an ordinary dairy farmer. One day, when he bought a dairy cattle, a group of cow vigilante set upon him and killed him. His fault? He was a Muslim. His name? Pehlu Khan.
Pehlu Khan’s lynching video, that once sparked anger, is now a forgotten story. But 29-year-old Aamir Aziz could not bear the apathy towards such incidents, so after two years, he decided to recreate the horrific tale of Pehlu Khan. “People saw the video, got angry and then forgot about it, but I just couldn’t accept something like this happened.” Aziz’s song, ‘Ballad of Pehlu Khan’, underlines the struggle minorities face in India these days. 

When Mumbai-based Aziz looks at the polarising atmosphere, he remembers the communal harmony he saw in his childhood. “In Patna, I always saw my mother wear a saree, never a burqa. We used to watch Ramayana and Mahabharata with our neighbours, and religious differences were never spoken about.” But the last five years have made him extremely conscious of his Muslim identity. “I have realised that I have a name that can take me to the grave for no reason.” His mother now worries each time he is travelling by train, a fear he never experienced earlier.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An actor by profession, Aziz always had an interest in music. His first stint with counter-culture began when he was studying at Jamia University. Seeking inspiration from Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, he started creating and performing songs for plays and events. He composed songs on Lokpal, sedition and 2G scam, but in the recent past, they have revolved around mob lynchings, (lack of) freedom and unemployment. Although his relationship with anti-establishment began during his college days, it was only in August last year that he released his first song ‘Ye Kaisi Azaadi’ on YouTube.

Protest music has always been a part of India, but urban counter-political music is still not a popular genre, and unlike Aziz, most singers emerged post-2014. With each distinct voice, the style differs, but the theme stays the same.

Coming from an army background, 22-year-old Armaan Yadav studies Literature at Ashoka University. In his rap song, ‘Saffron Ablaze’, Yadav talks about “saffron terror” and brings forward the incidents that have plagued India in the last few years — mob lynchings, Kathua rape case, quietening of dissenting voices and protecting the ‘killers of our democracy’.  

The lyrics, “my country’s up in flames, and the flames look saffron”, set the theme of the song. “It wasn’t supposed to be about saffron terror, but against propaganda, and all the incidents it triggered.” Into rapping for over six months, this is the only political song Yadav has released, but he aims to delve more into the realm in future. “When art starts getting dangerous to do, that’s when it should be done more,” he says.

She was an outspoken journalist. She was shot three times outside her own house. Her fault? She spoke against Hindu-extremism. Her name? Gauri Lankesh.

He has composed songs on demonetisation, Statue of Unity, Rafale deal and more. 
While the fear has never stopped him from doing what he does, he believes that the last five years have been a struggle to keep the Constitution and the idea of India alive.

Protest music in India evolved multiple times after independence. Starting with the communists singing about the class struggle in the 1940s and 50s, it took a local turn in 1980s. Regional languages, local issues, and the lack of internet played a role in these songs not reaching a wider audience. But the last few years saw a change in narrative, making it more political and urban. Political music, that was earlier used just as a propaganda tool, now took an anti-establishment turn.
Indian Ocean’s Rahul Ram, who is now associated with political satire group Aisi Taisi Democracy, is among the oldest names in protest music, which he likes to call social commentary. Being associated with the Narmada Bachao Andolan and sung songs like ‘Maa Rewa’ and ‘Bandey’, in Aisi Taisi Democracy, Ram gives a musical touch to the political climate. His songs ‘Naukri Kahan hai Deewane’ and ‘Chunav ka Mahina’ complement Varun Grover and Sanjay Rajoura’s stand-up acts. Aisi Taisi Democracy is India’s only collective that blends music and stand-up comedy. “Music lets us say things that we otherwise could not have spoken,” Grover says. 

Earlier, protest music did not come with the kind of resistance that is seen nowadays. Now, it comes with a badge of bravery and fear of life, a novel concept for the political satirists who were operating before 2014. 
“Let’s say I say the same joke, our prime minister does not talk, before and after 2014, the reaction I get is very different. The resistance to it now is so loud that a simple statement like this becomes a sign of protest.” Rajoura, who has been doing anti-establishment stand-up comedy for the last 10 years recalls the change in political atmosphere after 2014.
Varun Grover feels the last five years have been the worst example of bigotry being celebrated by the ones in power. “What message did we send out when we draped the body of Akhlaq’s killer in the national flag and labelled him a martyr?” Grover has been writing political comedy since 2005, but says, it never came with a sense of risking your life. “Trolling never led to actual killing, but that changed with Gauri Lankesh.”"

Governor Om Prakash Kohli unfurled the tricolour on Sadbhavna ground in Prabhas Patan, near Veraval and iconic Somnath Temple in Gir, at 9 AM. He was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel when the National Flag was hoisted. After saluting the flag, the governor and the CM rode in an open jeep and inspected the parade even as a helicopter showered rose petals from the air.

Marking the beginning of a new tradition, a woman contingent of Rajasthan state police also participated in the Republic Day parade and they were accorded the honour to lead the trail of platoons of police force. The contingent from the neighboring state was participating in parade in Gujarat following the call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for better cooperation and contacts among police forces of various states, the announcer at the function said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A platoon of Chetak Commandos of Gujarat police won applause for their disciplined movement and swagger. However, women platoons of Gujarat police won the loudest cheers from the crowd and dignitaries. Out of 30 platoons that participated in the parade, 10 were all-women and commanded by women. A platoon of Gujarat Forest Force and trainees of Raksha Shakti University, Ahmedabad also took part in the parade.

The march past was followed by a train of 35 tableau. They featured the proposed Statue of Unity being constructed downstream Narmada dam as a tribute to Sardar Vallabhabhai Patel. There were floats on Dr BR Ambedkar and on the industrial and agricultural achievements of the state. Simultaneous cultural performances by several groups, featuring among others, the Dhamal dance by Sidi tribe and traditional Garba of Gujarat also won hearts of the spectators. Students also performed Surya Namaskar and Yoga during the parade.
However, personnel of Gujarat police stole the show by showcasing their thrilling and high-risk motorbike stunts. Besides individual stunts, the policemen also demonstrated breathtaking balancing acts on their bikes in teams. Women personnel were applauded the loudest by the crowd, the CM and the governor when they rode their bikes dressed as Jhansi Ki Rani and jumped through a ring of fire.

The mounted unit of Gujarat police also showed off equestrian skills by demonstrating barrier jumping and flag racing. The dog squad of the police also put their skills on the show.
But two minor accidents distracted the performers and the public at the parade. A policeman performing stunts on his motorbike lost balance and the bike skidded into the spectators gallery, injuring three. The injured were rushed hospital immediately. Another mishap followed when a stunt woman fell off the back of her horse. While she was rushed to hospital, her shocked horse barged into the crowd before bolting off the ground.
The Chetal Commando platoon were adjusted the best contingent while Statue of Unity float presented by Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), a state government corporation which is executing the Narmad project and the statute, was declared the best tableau. The woman contingent of Rajathan police were also honoured.
At the end of march past and cultural performances, Anandiben again rode the open jeep and did a lap around the ground to acknowledge the applause. The ceremony came to an end at around 11:30 AM with the governor felicitating Freedom Fighters who were invited at the function."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday said he has not built Sardar Patel’s statue to “belittle Pandit Nehru”. While addressing an election rally at Amreli in Gujarat, Modi said the Opposition leaders claim to own Patel, however, none of them has visited the Statue of Unity yet.
“Patel’s stature is so tall that you don’t have to try too hard to make others look small,” he said.
Modi asked the crowd if they felt proud when the Statue of Unity and Gujarat’s name appear on Google when they search for the world’s tallest statue. The 182-metre tall statue, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was unveiled by Modi on October 31 last year and has been built at a cost of Rs 2,389 crore.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Appreciating how the ruling government managed to restrict terrorism to only “two and a half” districts of Jammu and Kashmir, Modi blamed the policies of the Congress-led governments on the Kashmir issue.
“In the past, bomb blasts used to happen at regular intervals, be it Pune, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kashi and Jammu. But have you heard (of) a single blast in the last five years? “Am I responsible for the present situation in Kashmir? Just because of the policies of Congress, we could not solve the Kashmir issue even after 70 years,” PTI quoted Modi as asking the gathering.
Referring to the Balakot air strike, Modi claimed he has put Pakistan in such a position that they were urging him to pick up the phone. “They (Pakistan) forgot that this is Modi…For the first time, you must have seen Pakistan crying. They were urging Modi to pick up the phone…we have put Pakistan in such a situation.”
Modi said his “grooming” in Gujarat made him stand firm during the Doklam standoff with China in 2017. He slammed the Congress over its poll promise to review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), scrap the sedition law and reduce security forces in Kashmir.
Taking potshots at Congress, Modi said in 2019, the Opposition is fighting on the lowest number of Lok Sabha seats but is still “dreaming” of becoming the ruling party."

“The Congress has kept their own leaders and freedom fighters such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,Lokopriyo Gopinath Bordoloi of Assam,Rani Gaidinliu of Nagaland and Subhash
Chandra Bose,Bhagat Singh in the shadows. They promoted only one family,” BJP Kisan Morcha national president Om Prakash Dhankar said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Without naming any family,he said,”The government which is not able to recognise the efforts of these freedom fighters has no right to be in power.”,he said.
“Bordoloi (first chief minister of Assam) who fought hard to keep Assam with India instead of becoming a part of the then East Pakistan during Partition was given Bharat Ratna only during the term of our Atal Behari Vajpayee government,” Dhankar said while talking to reporters here.
“The problem of Kashmir had not been there if Sardar Patel had been the first Prime Minister of India,” he said.
Describing him as the architect of united India,Dhankar said,”Sardar Patel’s secularism put India above everything else and the country needs this today. It was his efforts that brought the princely states in India”.
“Through BJP’s pan-India Statue of Unity Movement,Sardar Patel has now come back to the public memory to unite the country”,the BJP leader said.
“The statue is an initiative of the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government to pay tribute to Sardar Patel by erecting the world’s tallest statue. It will be 182 metres tall,three times the height of the Statue of Liberty in USA”,he said.
The statue of India’s first Home Minister would cost Rs 2500 crore and would be made of iron and soil collected from from each village in the country,he said.
The BJP Kisan morcha leader said the Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi was also welcome to send iron and soil from his state for construction of the statue.
Speaking on the Statue of Unity Movement,he said a workshop was held here today with the stake holders from seven North East states."

The Vadodara Municipal Commissioner on Thursday presented the civic body’s annual draft budget for the financial year 2019-20, pegged at Rs 3,555 crore.
“The year 2018-19 has been of great significance for Vadodara. The reputation of the city has increased ever since the inauguration of the world’s tallest Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in Narmada district, which is 90 km from the city. In order to reach the destination of the Statue, Vadodara will now be the nearest city offering connectivity by rail, road and air. The city has also seen recent air connectivity with two cities like Indore, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Jaipur apart from Delhi and therefore it is an extremely important phase for the city. The city also has world-class wonder World theme park at Ajwa, which is also a tourist attraction,” the Commissioner’s message in the draft budget stated.
The budget proposes to undertake work to complete transport connectivity from Vadodara to the surrounding developed and industrial areas around Vadodara like Bharuch, Anand, Padra, Savli and Kevadia Colony, under the smart city project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The 597-ft tall ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat and Mumbai’s Soho House have been featured by the Time magazine in its second annual list of the 2019 World’s greatest places, a compilation of 100 new and newly “noteworthy destinations to experience right now”.
The ‘Statue of Unity’, the world’s tallest statue, is a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, independent India’s first home minister as well as deputy prime minister. One of the prominent leaders of the Indian freedom movement, Patel, who is popularly known as the ‘Iron man of India’, was responsible for the integration of several princely states into modern India.
Standing tall at 597 ft on an island in the Narmada River, the statue towers over the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat, “offering visitors the chance to see views of nearby mountain ranges from its chest”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The tourist attraction pays homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who became India’s first Deputy Prime Minister in 1947,” the Time said.
According to the website of the ‘Statue of Unity’, the structure is aimed to inspire generations and showcases Patel’s vision on unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance. Till now 2.06 million people have visited the statue, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31, 2018.
Mumbai’s chic Soho House is located in an 11-­storey building overlooking the Arabian Sea. It houses a library, a cinema with 34 seats and a rooftop bar and pool.
“The unique feel comes in the shape of block-printed fabrics from Rajasthan; handwoven cane furniture; environmentally sustainable, sari-coated lampshades; and some 200 art pieces by mostly South Asian artists,” Time said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project of building world’s largest Statue of Unity, which proved to be a vehicle for him to connect to farmers across India, has been running late by seven months. The contract for the construction of the 182-meter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel monument, proposed in the vicinity of Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadiya Colony of Narmada district, was supposed to be awarded in December 2013.
The reason for the delay is ascribed to the Lok Sabha Elections. The awarding of contracts for the ambitious project would take one more month at least. Nearly three lakhs boxes, sent to nagarpalikas across India for collection of iron tools from farmers to be used in building the statue, have been arriving at Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited godown in Vadodara and Kevadiya Colony.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The designing, engineering, procuring and construction tender in this regard was floated in August 2013. “Initially, the tender was supposed to come out in December 2012, but it is till is in the process. The construction contract will now be out within a month,” said a top-level official from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust, which is carrying out the project in coordination with the Gujarat government.
The trust has top officials from the Gujarat government as board members, with PM Narendra Modi as its chairman. The officials maintained that initially the project got delayed as bidders asked for more time to prepare proposals for the project.
Later, the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was in place from the first week of March till April end. Things were supposed to start rolling from December 6, before Run For Unity on December 15. Modi laid the foundation stone for the statue on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Incidentally, Turner Project Management, a consortium of the North American and European companies, has been appointed as consultant for the project. Asian giants are vying to get the contract to build the world’s largest statue in Gujarat.
Civil engineering giants, including three Indians, a South Korean and a Chinese, have shown interest. Those in the fray include Shapoorji Pallonji Engineering and Constructions (India), JMC Projects (India) Limited, L&T (India) and Samsung C&T Corporation (Sourth Korea.
The Chinese firm that built Spring Temple Buddha, currently the tallest statue in the world, is also likely to be in the fray with an Indian partner. L&T, in the recent past, has done a couple of high-profile projects with the Gujarat government, including Mahatma Mandir and Swarnim Sankul-I in Gandhinagar. While Mahatma Mandir, a convention centre, is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, Swarnim Sankul-I houses Chief Minister’s Office in Sardar Patel Secretariat.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The statue, with a number of educational and entertainment components, will have features like bronze cladding on the statue and world’s fastest elevators. The three-level base of the statue – exhibit floor, mezzanine and roof – contains the Memorial Garden and a large exhibit hall. The observation deck at 500 ft can accommodate 200 people at a time to give panoramic view from this level. It will enable visitors to see the beautiful Satpuda & Vindhyachal mountain ranges, the 256-km-long Sardar Sarovar Reservoir and the 12-km-long Garudeshwar Reservoir."

On a day Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya village in Gujarat’s Narmada district, BSP chief Mayawati asked the BJP and the RSS to apologise to ‘bahujan samaj’ — people from marginalised and deprived sections —for criticising an earlier BSP-led government in Uttar Pradesh for building memorials and parks to honour great personalities from Dalit and Other backward Classes (OBCs).
Targeting the government, the Congress said that while Patel wanted institutions to be autonomous, the government is destroying them.
Mayawati said the 182-metre statue of Patel has been built at a cost of around Rs 3,000 crore but when her government had built memorials and parks in Lucknow and Noida to honour B R Ambedkar and other great personalities born in Dalit and OBC families, BJP and RSS leaders had criticised the move by calling it ‘extravagance’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Paying tributes to Sardar Patel, Mayawati said Patel, like Ambedkar, was a true nationalist and took pride in Indian culture and tradition. So why name the statue in English as Statue of Unity, she asked of the government in a statement. Mayawati also said that the mark of ‘foreign construction’ in Statue of Unity will always hurt Patel’s followers. She asked BJP leaders if they really have such high regards for Patel, why was a statue not built all these years in Gujarat, where the party has been in power for decades.
Taking a swipe at the government, Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Ironic that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being smashed. The systematic destruction of India’s institutions is nothing short of treason.” Rahul added that Patel was a “Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism”."

How different is the travelling experience in Vistadome from regular Indian Railways coaches?
The Indian Express spoke to passengers who travelled in the Vistadome coach in the Janshatabdi Express on Sunday. Among these was 45-year-old Mayur Vakani, actor who performs the role of ‘Sundar’ in the television serial ‘Tarak Mehta ka Ulta Chashma’.
“I have travellled in trains of Europe and I must say that the Vistadome coach is not just at par with them, but has surpassed them when it comes to facilities. This is like travelling in an aeroplane on railway tracks. The ride was extremely smooth and I did not feel any vibration or movement when the train was at full speed,” said Vakani.
Speaking to The Indian Express, an official of Western Railways said, “The salient feature of Vistadome is that it has air suspension spring riding comfort technology, which ensures passengers feel no tiredness at all during the journey. We encourage travellers to keep a glass full of water on the snacks table when the train is at full speed, and notice that the glass will be completely still.”

The opening of tenders for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet Statue of Unity project to build the tallest statue in the world as a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, uncannily coincided with the Union Budget injecting an additional Rs 200 crore declaring it a “National Project” on Thursday.
The tender bids for the construction and maintenance of the Statue of Unity were opened on Wednesday, with engineering giant L&T set to get the contract at the lowest bid of Rs 2,980 crore against the cost of Rs 2,063 crore estimated for the project.
Managing Director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), the implementing agency for the 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity project, J N Singh said that the declaration of a national project will definitely work positively for the project. “It will get national attention. And we stay assured that the Central Government is also there for us. Also, you stay assured that if there is any hurdle it will be resolved.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh said that the commitment of the Centre to grant Rs 200 crore to the project is also very encouraging. “The state government is there to fund the project. But, the Central assistance is welcome,” he added.
The Gujarat government’s 2014-15 budget also sanctioned Rs 500 crore for the Statue of Unity project. The Indian Express had run a report last month on how the iron collection drive for the project had not yielded the desired results with as many as 16 states not contributing anything for the project.
Sources said that the government had invited tenders for the design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance of the Statue of Unity from companies across the world. Only two firms filled the tenders – L&T being one and the other, a consortium of companies. Sources said that L&T had filed bid of Rs 2,980 crore for the project that included operation and maintenance of 15 years, whereas, the consortium had bid for Rs 4,100 crore.
The tender procedure was done by a consultant firm appointed by the SSNNL and now the latter plans to issue a Letter of Intent (LoI) to L&T for initiating the project after necessary negotiations. Sources said that L&T is expected to start work on the project after monsoon.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The application for organising Kisan Satyagraha called by Patidar leader Hardik Patel is still awaiting permission from local authorities, with just a day left in the meeting.

However, Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) functionaries said that they were hopeful of getting permission in due time and added that the event will take place as scheduled.
PAAS convenor, Hardik Patel taking to Twitter said, “The birth anniversary of Shri Sardar Patel, thousands of farmers will be united with the voice of rights in Junagadh, and the program will be attended by former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha and former Union Minister and MP Shatrughan Sinha. Sardar Patel’s dream Farmers prosperity.” The event will be held between 5 pm to 8 pm, a few hours after the PM inaugurates the Statue of Unity in Narmada district.

Modis announcement came on the eve of his completion of nine years as Chief Minister on October 9. A separate society formed under his chairmanship will monitor implementation of the idea,according to the BJPs official project brochure. It will be in the nature of a private-public partnership and will involve inviting suggestions from experts across the world.
To be located on Sadhu Bet in river Narmada,the memorial will be the tallest beyond comparison,reminding every onlooker not only of the freedom struggle but of the story of a united India. It will be a constant inspiration towards fulfilling the dreams of suraaj (good governance), said Modi. The proposed statue will be accessed by boat and visitors will be able to climb to the top in a lift to enjoy a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar dam and the surrounding hilly areas. Modi said the idea was to immortalise Patels contribution as the architect of modern and united India,earlier divided into over 500 princely states. Thanking people of Gujarat and the country for the tenure of his government,he said the first decade of the 21st Century marked the development of Gujarat and this was his way of commemorating it.
He said the Statue of Unity would be one of a series of monuments to perpetuate the contribution of great personalities,others being the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar,Shyamji Krishna Verma memorial in Kutch and the Buddha relics as well as the international conference on Buddhism. He said the Statue of Unity complex would also present the history of the past 90 years through the use of modern technology.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The memorial would facilitate research in issues dear to Patel like good governance,agriculture technology and development for the tribal population,Modi said. It will be completed in about three years,excluding the time taken up by feasibility studies and searching for experts. He said the cost would depend on the type of material to be used as suggested by experts."

The 66th Republic Day celebrations where President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle were chief guests bore one unmistakable stamp — that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
From the scripts of the announcers to the tableaux and folk dances performed on Rajpath, everything reflected Modi’s ideas. In the inaugural note, the presenter recited senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpaaye’s poem “Kadam Mila Kar Chalna Hoga”.
In contrast to previous years when the Gujarat tableau would feature folk arts, embroidery and mirror work by artisans, this year, the state’s tableau showcased Modi’s famed project — Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 182-metre tall ‘Statue of Unity’ coming up near Sardar Sarovar dam in Gujarat. The tableau also depicted “happy couples rejoicing their rich crop — a result of Sardar Sarovar Yojana”, the presenter claimed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In line with Modi’s initiative launched in September last year, a separate ‘Make in India’ tableau prepared by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion depicted a mechanised Lion, set against the backdrop of a “smart city” and the various sectors identified for investment. “This is an open invitation to the whole world to come, manufacture in India,” the announcer added.
The tableau by Central Works Public Department showcased a floral presentation of “Gaumukh” — the source of river Ganga, while the tableau by ministry of AYUSH showed a ‘Hakim’ examining a patient and acharyas performing yoga asanas.
The “Walk for Justice” tableau portrayed a Lok Adalat, conciliation efforts at a Village Legal Care and Support Centre, awareness sessions in jails and other services provided through National Legal Services Authority.
Modi’s “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” initiative also featured as a separate tableau depicting the celebration of the birth of a girl child. The 12 girls marching on each side symbolised the omnipresence of women in every walk of life.
Dressed in bright blue and white dresses, students from Govt. Girls’ Senior Secondary School in Nathupura in Delhi performed a dance Swachh Banaye Bharat, themed around the PM’s pet project.
However, when it came to cleanliness in the public enclosures at the parade grounds, people claimed the campaign was “nowhere” to be seen. “You should see the makeshifts toilets and bathrooms that have been put up. There is no flush or water inside. It was disgusting to even step inside,” Vaishali Singh told Newsline.
Apart from these, other interesting features included the Karnataka tableau — done up beautifully in myriad colours, depicting a craftsmen couple making Channapatna wooden toys.
Despite rain and the overcast weather, the parade grounds were full to the seams as thousands thronged to Rajpath to catch a glimpse of Obama.

Express Archives
Putting the seaplane project near Statue of Unity on fast track, the Gujarat government has planned to install a “trash rack”, a mesh-like structure that will prevent crocodiles in Narmada reservoir from populating the Magar Talav or crocodile pond adjacent to the dam.
The trash rack is nothing but a mesh grill that will be installed in a 300-m-long channel that connects Pond Two with Pond Three, which has been found suitable for the seaplane project. This will prevent new crocodiles from entering this pond and keep it crocodile-free in future,” a senior state government official has told The Indian Express.
There are four ponds between Narmada dam and the main canal head regulator. These four ponds are linked through a canal system to the dam. The biggest of them is Pond number Three.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is estimated that there are over 500 crocodiles in Pond Three where the project is being built and the forest department is in the process of relocating these reptiles.
“The trash rack will be about 50-60-m-wide and is expected to be around 200-300-m-long. It is expected to keep a check on the future population of crocodiles, which travels from the Narmada dam’s main reservoir to the Pond Three through interconnected channels,” the official remarked, adding that the trash-rack project will speed up the setting up of the seaplane terminal, which is expected to attract more tourists to the Statue of Unity site.
The Gujarat government is being cautious while dealing with the crocodile population that resides in and around the Narmada dam.

“The local sensibilities are also being taken into account as Narmada is considered as a Goddess and the crocodile is her “vahaan” or vehicle,” the official added, without revealing how many crocodiles have been relocated from the Magar talav.
“The openings of the mesh of the trash rack will be 10 by 10 cm, which will allow only small fish to pass through,” the official said, however, adding that the trash rack would be unable to prevent hatchlings of crocodiles from passing through.
The tender for the project had to be re-invited after the cost of using a 300 metric tonne crane for installation of the trash rack inside the channel was included."

On days they are working late, Dharmakirti Sumant and Alok Rajwade step out of their office in Kothrud, Pune, for dinner. “We meet balloon sellers on the street. They say, ‘We know you don’t need a balloon but we need money and we don’t want alms.’ So, we, 30-year-old men with no children, buy balloons at midnight,” says Rajwade. A girl selling balloons walks silently through A Doubtful Gaze At Uber At Midnight, a play which Rajwade has directed and Sumant has written. She is both real and absurd, and a symbol of the social and human conflict that, for 10 years now, has driven the darkly funny drama of Sumant and Rajwade.
The only other person on stage in A Doubtful Gaze At Uber At Midnight is a 30-year-old, unemployed man called Saket, who is stuck on a lonely road at midnight waiting for a cab. His girlfriend is possibly pregnant. His close friend, a self-titled Urban Naxal, has been caught by the police watching porn and smoking up. As the night deepens, the Uber journey segues into the history of contemporary India, its route landmarked by the murders of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare in Maharashtra, the killing of Gauri Lankesh in Karnataka and the building of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat. In the final scene, Saket finds out why “it is always sunset in India”.
Sumant, who won the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar 2012, was at the University of East Anglia on an Inlaks Scholarship in 2018 when he wrote the play. “The news from the country was very disturbing. People were being lynched publicly. We were made to think in false contradictions: Congress vs BJP, left vs right, success vs failure, capitalist progressiveness vs religious regression,” he says. The play was commissioned for the Serendipity Arts Festival in December 2018 and is the first in English for the Marathi duo. Its first public show, outside the festival, took place in Pune a few weeks ago. The play is set to travel to other cities.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Almost always, Sumant and Rajwade’s plays begin with the everyday and expand into the bizarre. Their 2016 production, Binkamache Sanwad (Useless Conversations), revolves around a confused 55-year-old man, who replaces his Nokia with an iPhone, and gets tangled in a maze of WhatsApp forwards. “WhatsApp is the rannbhoomi (battleground) of politics. We wanted to show how jingoist, Brahminical and sexist jokes seeps through social media,” says Sumant. He comes from a family of academics and finds “political affirmation … in the words and works of BR Ambedkar”.
“The trigger for Dharma’s writings is usually self-analysis but the story goes on to criticise right-wing politics,” says Rajwade. He is a famous face, courtesy his appearances in Marathi films such as Rajwade & Sons (2014), Rama Madhav (2014) and Vihir (2008), and gets stopped at FC Road, Pune’s youth hangout, for selfies. In 2017, Rajwade was named among the “30 under 30” important personalities in India by Forbes magazine.
The two studied in the same class at Aksharnandan School in Pune, where education methods had evolved from Mahatma Gandhi’s nayee taalim doctrine. Art was encouraged as were experiments in theatre. “In school, we never appreciated each other, but I did notice that Alok (Rajwade) had a good sense of humour,” says Sumant.
Rajwade adds that he was politically ambivalent till, at 16, he went to Germany with his father, an executive with Mercedes Benz. “One of the places I wanted to visit was the Dachau concentration camp, where Hitler had incarcerated political prisoners at the height of Nazism. In school, when I told one of my friends, a German, about my wish, he said, ‘Don’t go to a concentration camp as a tourist’,” he says. When Rajwade came back to India, one of the first friends he met said, “Hitler did the right thing.” “I realised then that I didn’t agree with this. I don’t know who I am or what my politics is but this support of Hitler is definitely wrong. Since then, I have opposed fascism in all forms. My politics is about upholding the Indian Constitution,” says Rajwade.
They first collaborated in 2009 when Sumant read out his new play, Geli Ekvees Varsha, at the office of Natak Company, founded in 2008 by students of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce and Fergusson College to “make plays that appeal both to the masses and the eclectics”. Geli Ekvees Varsha revolves around a 21-year-old protagonist, whose parents had been young during the Emergency. “What happened to the youth involved in liberal, leftist, socialist movements in and after the Emergency? What happened to the concept of a free, secular, liberal and ideal nation?” he asks them. The play emerged as the winner at Thespo 2009, a theatre festival held at Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai.
“To this day, my common point with Dharma’s writing is his constant urge to question the status quo,” says Rajwade. The director is responsible for most of the edgy stage design in their plays, including placing a commode on the stage in Geli Ekvees Varsha. Every time the character takes a dump, he launches into a monologue. “They have a unique way of looking at things happening around us. They depict normal life but stretch reality to the point when it breaks,” says theatre director and actor Niranjan Pednekar.
How does the group that wants to knock down Brahminical hierarchies function in an art form in which playwrights or directors have the final word? Their 2017 play, Natak Nako, deals with a similar topic. It is set in a rehearsal room of a theatre group, where actors turn on the director. “In the same group, people may disagree with the politics of the play. Sometimes, the disagreements become intense,” says Sumant.
“There is a thin line between being a director and dictator. I have to remember that what I want is to create a play that will hook people till the end. Dharma and I share a certain kind of love-hate relationship. We fight a lot but there is something in his writing which pulls me back,” says Rajwade.
Coming up later this year is their first film, written by Sumant and directed by Rajwade, titled Ashleel Udyog Mitra Mandal. It revolves around a man who invites a porn star to a dahi handi festival. “Every time one of us has done a film, we have channelled the money into theatre. We want to do only theatre but there is absolutely no money,” says Sumant, adding, “But Oscar Wilde says there is no point looking at a map where there is no place called utopia.” The show goes on."

A group of 10 activists from Gujarat have moved the Western Bench of NGT situated in Pune through lawyers Aseem Sarode and Alka Babaladi, pleading that the project was “illegal” as it has failed to take the required clearance. They have demanded that no further construction at the site be allowed till the permission is granted.

A bench of Justice V R Kingaonkar and expert member Ajay Deshpande admitted the petition and, after hearing the counsel of applicants, issued notice to the respondents asking for their say in the matter.
In the petition, the activists claim that despite repeated communications with the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited, the body or the state government did not furnish any information pertaining to the clearances taken by the project."

Along with the closure of the RBPH, the SSNNL also opened the gates of the Garudeshwar Weir, located 12 kilometres downstream of the dam, thus causing the river to dry. The RBPH, after generating power, releases the water downstream, which is then held by the Garudeshwar Weir to allow the Ekta Cruise of the Statue of Unity to run.
The closure of the RBPH would also mean a break from the cruise service.

In a statement on Thursday, RD Bhatt Additional Collector, Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority (SoUTA), said that the suspension of the Ekta Cruise has been “planned” in advance in order to also allow the work to commence on the development of the Narmada riverbank from Shoolpaneshwar temple to Tyagi ghat as the ‘Narmada Ghat’ on the lines of the ghats along the River Ganga in Varanasi, where evening prayers are offered.
The statement said, “The Ekta Cruise has been functional continuously for six months and it is necessary to give it a break for maintenance work. The summer is the suitable time since it has been decided that from March 29 to April 15, less water will be released downstream to maintain the level of the river at 26 meters. The Ekta cruise bookings closed for this period in advance as it was reserved for maintenance activity.”


At present, the Narmada dam has a storage of 2,227 million cubic meters (MCM) and 6590 cusecs of water are being released into the canal. The RBPH and the Canal Head Power House of the Sardar Sarovar Dam generated close to 245 Million Units of power per month during their operation since the beginning of the water year in June last year."

With this,the Gujarat Government also expedited the programme to collect iron tools from farmers across the country for Patels 182-metre Statue of Unity that is being constructed at Kevadia Colony in Narmada. Modi once again appealed to the farmers across the country to contribute iron tools for the statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

That is why,to make this Statue of Unity,we have taken the mission to join all seven lakh villages of India …When we remember Gandhiji,we remember truth,non-violence,sacrifice,simplicity,and Satyagraha.

She also alleged the Congress’ “hatred and prejudice” towards Gujarat and its people was not new, “as Rahul Gandhi and his party had objected to the proposal to build the Statue of Unity in the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat”.
Irani was referring to the remarks made by the former Congress chief at a poll rally in Assam in which he spoke about hiking the daily wage of tea workers by making tea garden owners from Gujarat pay, if his party is voted to power in that state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Rahul Gandhi recently said in a rally in Assam that he will take out money from the pockets of small tea traders of Gujarat. Earlier, they (Congress) had issues with the tea seller (PM Narendra Modi), and now they have problems with those who drink tea,” Irani said at a public rally for upcoming elections to local bodies held at Vansda town in Navsari district.
“I want to challenge Rahul Gandhi to try (‘azma lo’) Gujarat if he has guts. I also challenge him to contest polls from Gujarat. That will clear all his misconceptions,” the Minister for Textiles and Women & Child Development said. Rahul Gandhi had said the Congress will hike the daily wages of tea garden workers if voted to power in Asasam.

“Tea garden workers of Assam get Rs 167 per day, while traders from Gujarat get tea gardens. The Congress will put Rs 365 as daily wage into the pockets of the tea garden workers. Now you will ask me where will the money come from?…It will come from the traders of Gujarat,” he had said.
Irani said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of Gujarat had come up with the idea of constructing a grand monument dedicated to Sardar Patel. “However, Rahul Gandhi and his family objected to this proposal as their entire politics was always about erasing Sardar Patel’s name from the pages of history,” said Irani.


She alleged that when people are donating iron articles to build Patel’s statue, “I thought that Congress leaders would shun that prejudice and join this movement”. “But, they could not remove that hatred and prejudice towards Gujarat and Gujaratis from their minds. As instructed by Rahul and his mother (Sonia Gandhi), the opposition party disrespected the Statue of Unity,” the BJP MP alleged.

The statue has emerged as an international tourist destination, offering multiple attractions for all age groups, Gujarat’s Additional Chief Secretary (Forest and Environment) Rajiv Gupta said in a tweet.
The 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, billed as the world’s tallest and built on the Sadhu Bet islet near the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, 2018.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Since then, visitors from across the country and abroad have flocked the tourist spot and several other attractions that have been added there.
“#StatueofUnity crosses five million visitors mark !!! Built under visionary leadership of Hon.@PMOIndia it has emerged as an international tourist destination, offering multiple attractions for all age groups. @narendramodi @tourismgoi@souindia,” Gupta tweeted.
To improve rail and air connectivity to Kevadia, the government recently added eight new trains from different parts of the country and a seaplane service from Ahmedabad.
The flow of visitors to the tourist spot was affected after the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, but picked up rapidly since it was reopened for the public on October 17 last year after remaining closed for over seven months.
During his address on January 18 this year after flagging off eight trains to Kevadia from across India, Prime Minister Modi said more tourists visit the Statue of Unity in Gujarat than the Statue of Liberty in the US.

On Patel’s birth anniversary last year, Modi had also launched a seaplane service between the Statue of Unity and the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, further improving connectivity to the tourist attraction in Kevadia."

The state government on Friday said that there was no need to form a committee as suggested by the Gujarat High Court (HC) at a previous hearing in order to reach a consensus on the land dispute that has arisen in five villages of Narmada district owing to the planned development of the region around Kevadia colony near the Statue of Unity.
The division bench of HC headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath on Friday gave 10 days to the advocate for the petitioners, NM Kapadia and the state government’s counsels to formulate a workable plan that may facilitate mediation between the two parties to resolve the dispute.
The matter is expected to be heard on February 11.
A public interest litigation (PIL) was moved by civil right activists Mahesh Pandya, Anand Mazgaonkar, Ashok Naik and Jatin Sheth in July, 2019, on behalf of the residents, villagers and tribals from five villages around Kevadia colony. The villages include Kevadia, Vagadia, Navagam, Limdi and Gora. Tribal residents of these villages have been resisting acquisition of their land by the Gujarat government in the region around SOU.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
They argued that while the state government acquired the land parcels in the five villages in 1960, 1961 and 1962, the villagers continued to be in possession of the land and cultivate there. The petitioners had thus contended that as per the provisions of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, if an acquired land remains unoccupied for five years, the acquisition lapses.
During the court proceedings on Wednesday, the bench suggested formation of a committee consisting of law officers, judicial members, government officials and village representatives from the five villages, to resolve the dispute. No opinion on the court’s suggestion was given by the state government then.
An oral order to this effect was passed by the bench wherein time of 48 hours was given to both sides to take instructions so as to “find a solution for an amicable settlement” of the issue.
According to one of the petitioners present during the court proceedings, on Friday, the advocate for the petitioners orally submitted that the villagers were open to the formation of a committee.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
However, the state represented by the Advocate General Kamal Trivedi said that there was no need for a committee. The court then suggested that the counsels of both sides may come up with a resolution plan that both the parties will be amenable to."

But, so far, they have been put before the world so badly that it is Pakistan that has taken control of the narrative. (Express photo)
Two video clips I saw on social media last week came as proof for me personally that Article 370 would have had to go sooner rather than later. The first showed Pakistani children playing at becoming suicide bombers. With the sound of verses from the Koran in the background, small children lined up to embrace an older child before he crossed the dusty field in which they played and disappeared in a fake explosion. The second showed ISIS widows and wives in a camp in Iraq the day after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed. They screamed that a new leader would be born soon to deal with infidels. They wore black burqas and black gloves and spoke from behind veils that totally concealed their faces. They said it was the will of Allah that the jihad continue till all infidels be killed. Their dress code reminded me that they have sisters like Asiya Andrabi in Kashmir.
India as a victim for decades of jihadist terrorism has every reason to be worried about this kind of Islam spreading through Kashmir. And, it has been spreading slowly but surely for many, many years. It has changed the nature of Kashmiri Islam and it has changed the objective of the armed insurgency from ‘azaadi’ to establishing an Islamic state in Kashmir governed by the Shariat. This transformation of the ‘freedom movement’ did not begin after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it began long ago. Last week, on the day that the former state of Jammu & Kashmir lost not just its special status but its status as a state, senior Congress party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad declared publicly that there was no ‘Kashmir problem’ till 2014. He lied. Our Kashmir problem began in 1947 and was so badly handled by Congress prime ministers that even as the historical problem faded, a new one was born out of bad policies and terrible mistakes. Most of them made in Delhi. Not in Srinagar.
Having said this, it also needs to be said that the Kashmir tour that those random European legislators were treated to last week was a ludicrous public relations farce. Since the abrogation of Article 370, all attempts to win India’s case internationally have been absurdly farcical. Right from that first attempt by our National Security Advisor to show ‘normalcy’ in Srinagar by hosting a supposedly impromptu buffet lunch for a handful of locals in an ominously deserted street.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
India has compelling reasons for the abrogation of Article 370. But, so far, they have been put before the world so badly that it is Pakistan that has taken control of the narrative. Every time a new story appears in some important western newspaper about torture and repression in the Kashmir Valley, spokesmen of the Indian Government dismiss it as prejudice and Pakistani propaganda. Perhaps. But, when are we going to start telling our side of the story better? When are we going to explain to the world that India can simply not afford to have an Islamic caliphate take birth within her borders? This was beginning to happen in Kashmir right under the noses of Kashmir’s ‘mainstream’ political leaders and they were unable to stop it. Sadly, ‘liberal’ journalists and human rights activists on our side of the border were reluctant to admit that we were dealing with something more serious than a ‘freedom movement’.
What is even more worrying is that instead of a responsible, mature effort to counter Pakistan’s false narrative on Kashmir, what we have seen from the Modi government is a childish kind of triumphalism. Where is the need to make the abrogation of Article 370 an issue of ‘national honour’? Where is the need for senior ministers in Modi’s cabinet to keep boasting about his “56-inch chest”? They do him no good when they talk like this because now that Jammu & Kashmir have come under direct rule from Delhi, every time there is a new act of jihadist violence, it will be blamed on Modi personally. The Chief Minister of West Bengal has already blamed him for the murder of five Bengali workers who have become the most recent victims of jihadist terrorists in Kashmir. Why they are still operating freely is a question for the Home Minister to answer.
Last week, the Prime Minister said while paying tribute at the Statue of Unity that he has ordered built, that by abrogating Article 370 he has fulfilled Sardar Patel’s dream of uniting India. “Peace and development will now prevail in Jammu and Kashmir,” Modi said while standing beside one gigantic foot of the Statue of Unity. We must hope and pray that he is right. It is what everyone wants, including the people of the state that is now not a state but a Union territory. Sadly, the steps taken since August 5 have been less than convincing.

Irani, who is among the star campaigners of the BJP for the upcoming local body polls in Gujarat, was addressing election rallies in Vansda and Chikhli of Navsari district.
Referring to a purported statement made by Rahul recently in Assam, Irani alleged that the former has stated that he would take out money from every tea trader from Gujarat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Recently, someone who was an MP from Amethi (referring to Rahul), went to Assam, and said that if a small-time Gujarati trader buys tea leaves from Assam, then he will take out money from their pocket. Earlier, he was having problem with chaiwala and now with chai. I want to tell him that if you have the courage, fight an election from Gujarat, and everything will be clear (dum hein to kabhi Gujarat se chunav ladke dikhao, chai ka chai aur pani ka pani ho jayega),” she said.
During an election rally in Assam, Rahul, while speaking about hiking the daily wage of tea garden workers in the state, had said,“Tea garden workers get Rs 167, and businessmen from Gujarat get entire tea gardens.”
Attacking the Opposition Congress, the Union Minister said, “Those who ruled India for 60 years, they have not made a single toilet for the poor families. It was Modiji who had made 10 crore toilets in the country, for the poor families in India. In the upcoming local body elections, before casting votes, see the toilets in the poor families and then vote for the party which had made it.”
She added, “The people of Gujarat wanted to construct Statue of Unity in the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had united India. The Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi had opposed it. It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had appealed to the people of the country to contribute (for the project). Rahul Gandhi and his family could not digest this as their politics of removing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel from the history would get disturbed.”

Irani further slammed the Congress in Gujarat for “remaining invisible” during a crisis.
“Will you support that party that had not looked at the poor during the (Covid-19) pandemic, or you will support a party whose workers had put their life on risk and worked for the betterment of the public? It is not new for the Gujarat Congress to remain invisible during a disaster. When there was flood-like situation in Gujarat, the BJP workers and leaders worked for the people. At that time, the Congress leaders were enjoying in a resort,” the Union Minister alleged.
Meanwhile speaking at another rally for general elections of Unjha Nagarpalika, the Union Minister recalled the work done by Narendra Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat and then as Prime Minister in providing 24*7 electricity to crores of people living in rural areas.
Addressing a public gathering at Vadipara Chowk locality of Unjha, Irani said, “People of Unjha have made a glorious chief minister a prime minister of this country at a time when there were a number of villages and hamlets in the country who were facing darkness after sun set (due to lack of electricity).”

Irani said that Modi carried his virtues from Gujarat to Delhi and announced Swachhata Abhiyan as a yagna from the temple of democracy.
Launching another attack on Congress and Rahul, Irani said that those who visit temples only during elections or those who questioned existence of Lord Ram in an affidavit will not be able to understand it. Only those, she added, can understand it who “carry their adorable God in their heart” and who “chant Jai Shree Ram slogan in every nook and corner of the country”.

Dominated by Patidar community, Unjha Nagarpalika is having 36 seats. In 2015, the party did not field a single candidate on its symbol owing to the heat it was facing from Patidar community in the wake of Patidar reservation agitation."

(Source: Reuters)
Lagging behind the schedule for the Sardar Sarovar dam project with majority of sub-minor canal works to be completed, the state government has announced Rs 9,000-crore fund for the project in its budget which also includes Rs 500 crore for its ambitious Statue of Unity project on Tuesday.
Giving details of the Sardar Sarovar project, Finance Minister Saurabh Patel said, “In the last three years, works of 5,342 kms have been completed by acquiring 10,726 hectares of land from 70,840 farmers with their consent. Till date, canal works of the length of 25,079 km have been completed and irrigation capacity for total 9.75 lakh hectares has been created.”
“In order to accelerate the works of canal construction, about 232 works costing Rs 9,091 crore have been taken up during April 2010 to May 2014. Now, we are planning to complete the remaining works of canals and distribution network in a phased manner in 2015-16,” he added.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Intelligence provided by Pakistan’s National Security Advisor of a possible 26/11-style fidayeen assault on religious sites and processions in Gujarat during Maha Shivratri celebrations on Monday and Tuesday led authorities to order a massive mobilisation of state police personnel and National Security Guard (NSG) units, a top government official familiar with the matter has told The Indian Express.
The unprecedented intelligence warning did not contain specific details on the jihadist group involved, or information that could lead police to perpetrators, the source said. However, he said “there was enough credible sourcing for the matter to be taken very seriously”.
Read : Terror alert in Gujarat: Security heightened, raids in Kutch; Centre rushes two NSG teams to state https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Lieutenant-General Naseer Janjua conveyed the warning to his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, on Saturday, following which NSG special forces were deployed to Gujarat to back up state police.
India, a diplomat said, believes the intelligence was provided “to pre-empt a potential crisis in bilateral relations, even war”. “Lots of pressure has been mounted by India and the United States, and perhaps it is paying off,” said the source.





Jihadist blogs in Pakistan, interestingly, have been speculating for several weeks that India and Pakistan have been sharing intelligence to target al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, with one article even alleging that Janjua conveyed information that allowed India to shut down a terror cell in December.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s foreign affairs advisor, Sartaj Aziz, also admitted that one of the three phone numbers used by the terrorists who attacked the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot had been traced to the Jaish-e-Muhammad’s headquarters in Bahawalpur.
However, although Pakistan has shut down Facebook pages and websites linked to the Jaish, the Bahawalpur seminary remains open. None of the organisation’s key officials are known to have been arrested either.
Fears of an attack in Gujarat have been mounting over the last four months, sparked by the discovery of five abandoned fishing boats in Harami Nullah, a channel that snakes along the India-Pakistan border before emptying into the Vianbari Creek. The fifth boat was discovered by the Border Security Force (BSF) just last month.
BSF officials believe the boats were most likely used by traffickers, rather than terrorists, but noted that their movement across the border without detection raised fears about security.
The BSF’s border surveillance operations, one officer said, has been severely hampered by the lack of air support, after the sole helicopter available crashed in Rajasthan.
Islamabad’s decision to pass on the intelligence emerged from multiple rounds of meetings between Doval and Janjua, after they first met in Paris last November. The two agreed, at a meeting in Bangkok the next month, to resume diplomatic engagement between the two countries, but continued to maintain a one-to-one channel on terrorism-related issues.
The intelligence on the possible attack in Gujarat is just the second exchange of its kind between the two countries, coming over a decade after India’s Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) passed on the contents of intercepted phone calls warning of a December 15, 2003 assassination attempt on Pakistan’s then President, General Pervez Musharraf.
In the summer of 2003, then R&AW chief C D Sahay and his counterpart at the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, Lieutenant-General Ehsan-ul-Haq, were tasked with working out a deal to restore peace on the Line of Control, by addressing India’s concerns on cross-border infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.
The dialogue was ordered by then Prime Minister A B Vajpayee and General Pervez Musharraf, when they decided to resume diplomatic engagement in the wake of the 2001-2002 military crisis.
Haq and Sahay met several times in third countries, hammering out the contours of the unwritten ceasefire that went into place on the LoC in December 2003, allowing India to fence-off infiltration routes.
Less than a fortnight before that ceasefire, breakaway Jaish-e-Muhammad operatives attempted to assassinate Musharraf by detonating a bomb as he crossed the Nullah Lai outside Rawalpindi. R&AW passed on intercepted telephone communication predicting the attack, said a highly-placed source.
Haq later called up Sahay to pass on a message of thanks from Musharraf, according to the source.
Later, in 2006, the two countries set up a Joint Anti-Terrorism Institutional Mechanism to “implement counter-terrorism initiatives and investigations”. However, the mechanism did not result in any sharing of usable intelligence or prosecutions, and collapsed after the 26/11 attacks.
Following 26/11, Pakistan’s then President Asif Ali Zardari called for the creation of a system to ensure “timely information and intelligence sharing between the two counties to prevent any incident of terrorism”. His call was later backed by former intelligence chiefs from both countries.
Even earlier, the two governments used secret channels in attempts to resolve tensions. In 1987, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi despatched then R&AW chief A K Verma to a secret meeting in Switzerland with his Pakistani counterpart, Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul. The two men discussed means to defuse the risk of war caused by Pakistani support to the Khalistan insurgency."

A drilling machine perched atop the 70-metre-high Sadhu Bet in Narmada district has begun to flattened the hillock to prepare way for the laying of the Statue of Unity foundation.
According to engineers of the company contracted by the Gujarat government, L&T, working at the site, the hillock will be flattened to 60 metres after which the foundation stone of the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be laid.
The engineering team working on the construction of the Statue of Unity has begun levelling the hillock Sadhu Bet, located at a distance of 3 kms from the Narmada dam. The hillock, which is mainly a quartzite rock, will bear the 52 meter deep foundation the statue, touted to the the world’s tallest at 182 metres.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An engineer at the site said, “The machines are currently set up to begin slicing of the rock. We have begun by levelling its peak, cut to size by 10 metres from its current height. A temporary road has been forged for the machines to travel up to the rock, but we perceive this will be a difficult mode in the long run of the construction. So, a concrete bridge will be constructed to connect the river island, Sadhu Bet with the parallel road to allow construction materials to be ferried.”
The engineer said that the work is slated to begin in full speed as the geological survey of the site conducted in February has yielded positive results.
In February, a team of engineers of the consortium of Turner Construction, Michael Graves and Associates and the Meinhardt Group conducted the geological soil survey undertaken to ascertain the nature of the strata of the soil where the raft foundation of the statue will be constructed to ensure that the founding level of the surface has no anomalies that can be hazardous for the structure.
According to the data available with the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), for the raft foundation for the proposed monument the recommended safe bearing capacity is 2,300 KPa.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Although the area witnessed as many as four low intensity tremors in February, the site has been termed “safe” from the point of view of seismic hazard. The engineers confirm, however, that no blasting activity will be undertaken at the site during the construction. Instead, advanced slicing technologies will be used to shape the base so as to prevent any disturbance to the base of the hillock due to blasting."

Praising the diversity of India, Trump said, “India is the country that has always been admired and where millions of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, and Christians worship side by side. You have always stood strong as one great Indian nation.”

Addressing a crowd of more than 1,00,000 people at the Motera cricket Stadium in Ahmedabad, the world’s biggest, the US President said, “Under PM Modi, villages in India have access to electricity. Over 300 million more have got internet connection. India will soon become the home to the world’s largest middle class. What is impressive is that India has achieved all this as a democracy and as a tolerant country. India’s achievement is unrivalled.”

“Story of the Indian nation is a tale of extraordinary diversity, world’s largest democracy, strong and noble people,” he said, praising India for exhibiting “confidence in its own people, trust in its people.”
Trump also touched on India’s cultural diversity and riches as he highlighted the success of its blockbuster movies like DDLJ (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge) and Sholay, and its sporting icons like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. “Five months ago, the United States welcomed your great Prime Minister at a giant football stadium in Texas and today, India welcomes us at the world’s largest cricket stadium right here in Ahmedabad,” he added, thanking India for its hospitability.

Before Trump’s speech, addressing the Namaste Trump event, Modi said history is being scripted at the Motera Stadium. “Five months ago, I started my journey with Howdy Modi. And today, my great friend Trump has started his journey in India in Ahmedabad with ‘Namaste Trump’. After the long journey, Trumps made their way to the Sabarmati Ashram,” said Modi, while welcoming them to the “biggest democracy in the world.” He also made the crowd chant “long live India-US friendship”.
Crediting Donald Trump for strengthening India-US ties, Modi said, “India-US relations are no longer just another partnership. It is a far greater and closer relationship. One is ‘land of the free’,the other believes the world is one family. One feels proud of ‘Statue of Liberty’ the other feels proud of ‘Statue of Unity’. Trump thinks very big. The entire world has seen his efforts and his leadership.”

The modified version has been reprinted by the Navjivan Trust,founded by Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad.
The book,titled Hind Ke Sardar,has been reprinted by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET),headed by CM Narendra Modi,who is executing the Statue of Unity project. The book was launched by senior BJP leader L K Advani during its foundation-stone laying ceremony.
K Srinivas,joint secretary and a member of SVPRET,said,The book is the most authentic version on Patels life. It has been published by Navjivan Trust,which was chaired by Patel himself for more than 20 years.

The cover of the book carries the picture of Patel along with the logo of Statue of Unity. There is a special page,which carries Modis Foreword,which has been added.

(Source: File)
BJP MP Mansukh Vasava on Tuesday dubbed senior IAS officer Rajiv Kumar Gupta an ‘angrez’ (Britisher) for allegedly giving orders to remove stalls and handcarts operated by local tribals near at the Statue of Unity in Narmada district of Gujarat.
Angry over the extensive anti-encroachment drive undertaken near the colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Vasava lashed out at a section of bureaucrats, saying since they live in air-conditioned houses, they do not know the plight of the poor.
The prominent tribal leader said local residents should have been taken into confidence before launching the drive near the imposing monument, a major tourist attraction, as it has affected their livelihood.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Gupta, a 1986-batch officer of Gujarat cadre, is Managing Director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd and also serves as Additional Chief Secretary (Forests & Environment).
In his defence, Gupta said the anti-encroachment drive was necessary as a large number of stalls and handcarts have been put by locals on both sides of a road leading to Statue of Unity, resulting in traffic snarls and even accidents.
Vasava rushed to the statue site near the Sardar Sarovar Dam upon learning that local administration has started a drive to remove such stalls and handcarts.
“On one side, our (BJP) government talks about providing employment to the poor. On the other side, some IAS officers, who live in air-conditioned houses, do not know the plight of the poor people.
“There is one angrez officer Gupta, who is making new rules every day. He does not care about the poor people’s livelihood,” Vasava told reporters.
Vasava was elected from Bharuch, while the Statue of Unity falls under the adjoining Chhota Udaipur Lok Sabha seat, represented by another BJP MP, Geeta Rathva.
“Gupta has a British (per-independence British rule) mentality. He does not like tribals. He thinks that stalls and handcarts are reducing the charm of the Statue.
“Gupta should have take into confidence local tribals before taking such an action.
“An IAS officer must understand the problems of people. What will these tribals do now as their livelihood has been snatched away,” said Vasava, known to be a vocal leader.
Explaining his stand, Gupta said the drive against encroachments was necessary to end traffic congestion on a stretch of a key road between Kevadiya village and the Statue of Unity.
“He (Vasava) is an MP and I have the highest regard for him. The decision against (removing) encroachments was taken as per government policies and prescribed rules and laws,” said the senior bureaucrat when asked about his reaction to Vasava’s critical remarks about him.
“Over 30,000 tourists and 4,000 vehicles are coming to the Statue of Unity every day. Due to this, encroachments on both the sides of the road and resultant traffic congestion have became a serious issue since the last few months.
“People were getting stranded for almost two hours because of presence of roadside stalls, sheds and handcarts.
“Moreover, even pedestrian tracks were encroached by hawkers, making it impossible to even walk till the monument,” said Gupta, justifying the drive.
According to local officials, around 200 such stalls and handcarts were removed during the drive on Tuesday.
Designed as a memorial to the first home minister of independent India, the 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel, touted as the world’s tallest, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31 last year."

Over 2,000 tribals gathered at Indravarna village in Nandod taluka of the tribal dominated Narmada district on Wednesday to register their protest against the governments proposal to acquire land for the development of the area for tourism purposes.
The Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA)  established in 2005 to develop the region mainly with the focus on improving tourism infrastructure  had sought consent from the village panchayats of 54 villages earlier this year to acquire land. As many as 29 of these villages fall under protected forest area.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The KADA has asked the village panchayats to part with their land. It has stated that if they do not respond in time,theyd consider it as their consent and take away the land. Most gram panchayats have said no,and have said theyd rather seek development under the provisions of the gram panchayat and not town planning, said Lakhibhai Musafir,a member of the KADA Virodh Manch,which is leading the protest against Chief Minister Narendra Modis dream project.
KADA plans to develop the area under town planning scheme so it could pave way to set up infrastructure such as hotels,camping ground,trekking trails,resort,water park,golf course,among others,in order to give boost to tourism in the region. The project has been expedited as the proposed Statue of Unity is expected to draw a large number of tourists in the region.
The construction of the statue,coming up at Sadhu Tekri,around 3.2 kilometres downstream from the dam,is expected to begin by early 2014 and will take four years to complete. However,the KADA proposal has met with resistance from the tribal villagers who do not seem to be in the mood to part with their land.
Vikram Tadvi,a protester from Kevadia village,said giving land to the government was not a good idea specially when the state government was yet to properly compensate to farmers in 16 villages that were submerged in water following the construction of the Narmada dam.
Villagers are yet to get right compensation for their loss,and now the government wants more land for development. We do not think we can be rightly compensated for their land. And where will they earn their livelihood once their land is taken away from them? he asked.
Protesting tribals shouted,jaan denge,jameen nahi (we will give our life,but not our land),jameen rotlo aape chhe (we get food from our land),amaro gaam,amaro raaj (our village,our rule), vikas joiye chhe na ki vinas (we need development and not destruction),among others,to register their protest against the move of the KADA to acquire land.
KADA Chief Executive Officer D B Rahewar said that his office has so far only asked consent from 54 villages to acquire their land for town development purpose,and the process was still at initial stage.
We have added 54 more villages under our scheme and have sought consent from the panchayat but are yet to get their consent. We intend to develop the area under town planning scheme. The systemic development of the basic infrastructure in the region will be meant for mass service, he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The Gujarat Government has planned to install a replica of the Statue of Unity in Gandhinagar to have it pass through a “public response” test. Chief Minister Anandiben Patel who was on a visit to Kevadia to inspect progress of construction on the installation of the spillway gates, said that the state government is keen on ensuring that the final statue of Sardar Patel, which is to come up on Sadhu Bet in Narmada, meets the expectation of the people.
For this, a 20-metre tall statue will be part of the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas celebrations in Gandhinagar where NRIs and citizens will be able to register their reactions on the rough draft, to the expression on Sardar Patel’s face in the statue and its general appearance, “suggest” their thoughts about the statue to the state government.
Patel said that the state government was “welcome to suggestions” from people for the Statue of Unity design. In an aim to involve general public opinion in the design of the Statue of Unity, the state government will place a 20-metre tall replica of the statue at a vantage location between Vidhan Sabha and Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar during the upcoming Pravasi Bhartiya Divas between January 7 and 9.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to a release from the state government, it would also help people “acquaint themselves with the life and times of  Sardar Patel.”
The government expects the statue to be a big centre of attraction for tourists as the premises would also be an educational hub, a water research centre engaged in research of agricultural crops in the vicinity and an institute of higher learning for tribal students.
According to Patel, a replica of statue is being readied in order to “seek reviews” from visiting NRIs and people during the PBD so that the suggestions can be incorporated into the final design. Patel said, “We are readying a replica of the Statue of Unity and it will be placed at a location on the road that leads from the Vidhan Sabha to the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar. The statue will be 20-metre tall. We are welcoming feedback from people that will be compiled and analyzed to ensure that the final design of the 182-metre tall statue meets the expectation of the people. In Gandhinagar, people will be able to see if the statue has proper face, expressions, posture and they can leave suggestions for us.”
The official Twitter handle of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) on December 10 said that the “construction time of Statue of Unity is fixed at 42 months. No escalation on labour, fuel and material is allowed.”
SSNNL officials say that the replica of the statue, being readied by SVPRET, will be designed in fibre and supported by heavy metal stands to keep it in place.
“It will retain all features of the Statue of Unity. It will be an exact copy of what the Statue at Sadhu Bet is to be. The government has directed SVPRET to ensure that people feel involved in the project and their suggestions about what feel the statue gives them is to be noted. It is, however, more an attempt to market the programme with NRIs who will be visiting the country and the event, to make them aware about the upcoming tourist attraction,” an official said.
SVPRET had also used the November 27-December 1 Vadodara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) exhibition in Vadodara as a platform for the promotion of the Statue of Unity, projected as the World’s Tallest Statue. At the event, a 7-metre tall statue was strategically placed at the entrance, attracting many a curious visitors. However, organisers of the VCCI fair say that the government had not instructed them to collect any suggestions.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

On October 31, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil the world’s tallest statue, the “Statue of Unity,” in the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. One may recall that when Modi started his campaign for the 2014 general elections, he appealed to farmers to donate their used farm implements for the construction of this statue that would remind the country about the role played by Sardar Patel in not only unifying a divided country but also his devotion to the cause of farmers. Some Opposition leaders have criticised the project on the ground that the statue uses imported Chinese bronze, and not iron from farmers’ used instruments. We do not touch upon that controversy, but want to focus on Patel’s message on agriculture. If the Modi government heeds that message, it will be offering a real tribute to the Sardar.
It would be interesting to recollect Patel’s contribution to Indian dairy farmers. In 1942, safety concerns drove the colonial government to tap a private dairy, Polson, in order to procure milk from Kaira district in Gujarat and supply it to Bombay, some 350 km away, where the Britishers were stationed. This marked the beginning of the government’s Bombay Milk Scheme (BMS) and the creation of a market for Kaira’s milk producers. But this established Polson’s monopoly over the Bombay market, as a seller. Polson also became a monopsony, as a buyer from Kaira farmers. As a monopolist and monopsonist, the company extracted large rents by squeezing the prices it offered the farmers, who approached Sardar Patel for help. Patel urged them to organise cooperatives and cut supplies to Polson. He asked his deputy, Morarji Desai, who, in turn, asked Tribhuvandas Patel, to carry the struggle forward. In 1945, agitated farmers held a 15-day strike against BMS. They spilled milk on the streets, instead of supplying it to Polson. This broke Polson’s monopsony. The Bombay market was opened for direct supply of milk from Kaira farmers. This access to a lucrative market incentivised farmers, and they formed the first farmers’ integrated dairy cooperative — the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union, which was registered in 1946. Verghese Kurien, the father of the White Revolution, joined the cooperative as a general manager and set up the first processing plant at Anand to convert excess buffalo milk into milk powder and cheese — a technological wonder at that time.

On Patel’s birth anniversary in 1964, the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was invited to inaugurate Gujarat’s first cattle-feed compounding factory. He reached Anand a day before the event and spent the night among villagers. Impressed by the district’s transformation, he urged Kurien to spread the message of Kaira’s business model across India. As a result, the architecture of “Operation Flood” was laid down, and a new institution, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), was formed on July 16, 1965, with Kurien as its chairman. Kurien spearheaded the operation by compressing the value chain and scaling-up vertical coordination between farmers, processors and consumers through cooperatives. He mobilised funds through sale proceeds of skimmed milk powder and butter donated by the European Economic Commission, loans from the World Bank, and subsidies from the government and invested them in strengthening the dairy value chain. As a result, cooperatives, especially in Gujarat, managed to ensure the highest share of the consumer’s rupee (75-80 per cent) to the farmers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Operation Flood (1970-96) has had a significant impact on milk production. It rose from 20 MMT in 1970-71 to 31.6 MMT in 1980-81 to 44 MMT in 1985-86 and 69.1 MMT in 1995-96 — a jump of nearly 50 MMT in 25 years (see figure). As Kurien would often say, organising farmers was an easy task, but accessing lucrative markets was a challenge. As production expanded, Kaira farmers tapped markets as far as Calcutta. The milk travelled 2,000 km by rail on specially-designed tankers.
But despite the success of Operation Flood, less than 10 per cent of the total milk production was being processed through cooperatives. The success of milk cooperative remained largely confined to Gujarat, despite the preference given to cooperatives in allocating licences for dairy processing plants. It was only in 2002 that the dairy sector was fully de-licenced by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. This created competition and the processing capacity created by the private sector outstripped the cooperative’s capacity.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-5422695"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/patel-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""544"" height=""521"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/patel-2.jpg 544w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/patel-2.jpg?resize=450,431 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/patel-2.jpg?resize=423,405 423w"" sizes=""(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px"" />
However, the organised cooperatives and private sector are still processing less than a quarter of milk production in India. India is now the world’s largest milk producer — 176.4 MMT in 2017-18, leaving the US (98 MMT) and China (45 MMT) far behind. However, food safety concerns with regard to milk remain.
Today, the farmers have to suffer low prices of farm produce, ranging from milk to pulses and oilseeds and cotton. The Modi government has announced minimum support prices (MSPs) based on a formula that gives at least 50 per cent margin over Cost A2+FL. But unfortunately, market prices remain 10 to 50 per cent below these MSPs. The real tribute to Patel would be to carry out large-scale structural reforms in agri-markets that can ensure a higher percentage of the consumer’s rupee going to farmers, be it through cooperatives, or any other marketing channel. If the Modi government can effect this reform, it would have paid a real tribute to Sardar Patel from the farmers’ standpoint."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday arrived in Gujarat to attend the annual conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police. Modi arrived at the Vadodara airport in the morning, where he was received by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, a state government release said.
From the airport, Modi left for the Statue of Unity near Kevadiya in Narmada district to attend the annual conference of DGPs and IGPs. The venue for the meet is a ‘tent-city’ set up near the 182-metre tall statue dedicated to country’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The three-day event began on Thursday in the presence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Before heading for the conference, Modi visited the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, which he had unveiled on October 31. Modi also paid floral tributes to Sardar Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The PM tweeted that the discussions at the DGPs/IGPs conference would strengthen the country’s “security apparatus”. “Reached Kevadia in Gujarat for the Conference of DGPs/IGPs. Looking forward to fruitful deliberations that will strengthen our security apparatus,” he said in the tweet.
“Paid tributes to the great Sardar Patel at the ‘Statue of Unity.’ As India’s Home Minister, his contribution towards building the framework of our security systems is immense,” the PM added.
In another tweet, Modi urged the countrymen to visit the world’s tallest statue. “I would specially urge you all to visit Kevadia and see the ‘Statue of Unity’. Some friends told me that the Statue can also be seen during Delhi-Mumbai flights. So, next time you are flying that route do try to spot the Statue,” Modi said in another tweet. On Saturday, Modi is scheduled to address the BJP women’s wing workers on the last day of a national convention of the party’s Mahila Morcha at Trimandir, a temple complex near Adalaj village in Gandhinagar."
"1618505218-1039","https://indianexpress.com/page/32/?s=%22Statue+of+unity%22","‘Neo middle class’ is the new ‘aam aadmi’","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/neo-middle-class-is-the-new-aam-aadmi-2/","‘Neo middle class’ is the new ‘aam aadmi’","July 11, 2014 1:34:08 am","The Congress had its “aam aadmi”, the BJP has its “neo middle class”. Defined by the BJP as those who have risen from the category of the poor but are yet to stabilise in the middle class, the “neo middle class” figured prominently in Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s maiden Budget speech on Thursday.
Another visible shift was the decision to name various schemes and programmes after RSS ideologues — the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission for integrated project-based infrastructure in rural areas and Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana to augment power supply. The New Teachers Training Programme was named after Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, who used to shuttle between the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha.
Jaitley, who was imprisoned during Emergency, also proposed a Jai Prakash Narayan National Centre for Excellence in Humanities in Madhya Pradesh, paying tribute to a leader who spearheaded the mass movement that led to Indira Gandhi’s ouster. An allocation of Rs 200 crore has been set aside for the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The replacement of the “aam aadmi” by the “neo middle class” marks a definite shift in the NDA government’s approach. Even as Jaitley announced a slew of measures targeted at poverty reduction, the acknowledgement of the new aspirational class, a product of the post-liberalisation era, indicated that the politics of freebies, hailed as welfare schemes by the previous governments, may have come to an end.
It was in December 2012 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, first coined this term in the BJP’s manifesto for the Assembly elections. In its 2014 manifesto, the BJP pledged to “meet the aspirations” of this “neo middle class”, saying they need “proactive hand-holding”. They formed a vital part of Modi’s social media strategy to reach out to the youth.
“Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves from the curse of poverty. Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from the difficult challenges have become aspirational. They now want to be a part of the neo middle class,” said Jaitley in his Budget speech.
Announcing the allocation of Rs 7,060 crore for Modi’s vision of 100 smart cities, Jaitley said the “neo middle class” aspired for better living standards. While setting aside Rs 200 crore for credit enhancement facility for young start-up entrepreneurs belonging to the Scheduled Castes, he again referred to their aspiration “to be a part of the neo middle class”.
While Modi has never given any specific estimates of the numerical strength of this “neo middle class”, the BJP, conscious of the section’s electoral clout, seeks to engage them through policy prescriptions to address their aspirations.
The naming of major schemes after RSS ideologues appeared to be a deliberate attempt to nudge the Congress icons out. Last year, senior BJP leader M Venkaiah Naidu, currently holding parliamentary affairs portfolio, had said, “It has been the Congress that has glorified contributions of one family by giving it credit for everything taking place in the country before and after the Independence.” He claimed Congress had launched 650 schemes in the name of three leaders — Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.
According to information released by Planning Ministry in response to a 2012 RTI query by Hisar-based activist Ramesh Verma, 27 out of 58 institutions and schemes run by the Centre were named after the three former PMs. Among them are Indira Awaas Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission."

After the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel built in the tribal-dominated Narmada district, another tribal-dominated district of Tapi will get an 81-foot Shiva statue one foot short of another Shiva statute, which is the state’s tallest statue in Dwarka.
The statue is expected to cost around Rs 1 crore. Digvijaysinh Valvi, a tribal community member who runs an NGO, Nisarg Foundation, says the cost will be borne by his NGO. The statue, being built at Nasarpur village of Nizar taluka will be thrown open to public in the next couple of months, he said. Son of retired police inspector Pruthvisinh Valvi, Digvijaysinh (39), said, “Our village has a population of 700 people and all are tribal Hindus. In Tapi district, there are no big temples so I decided to do something big… A 21-foot Nandi statue is also getting ready and the entire project will be completed in the next couple of months.”
The land on which the statue is being built is owned by Pruthvisinh Valvi. Work on the concrete structure began one-and-a-half years ago and uses nearly one tonne of iron, said Digvijaysinh, who dropped out of an engineering degree course and runs a petrol pump at Sagbara in Nizar taluka.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said he was inspired by a Shiva statue he saw in Manjalpur area on one of his travels to Vadodara, and decided to build a similar one.
Tapi district has a sizeable number of Christians in talukas such as Songadh, Vyara, Dolvan and Uchhal. The numbers are fewer in Nizar, Valod and Kukarmunda talukas. There are over 500 churches and prayer halls in the district that shares a border with Maharashtra, adjoining Dang district, which also has a large number of Christians who are mostly converted Hindus."

In the last Mann ki Baat episode for 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reflected on the country’s achievements over the year and asked people to be positive. He also spoke on the celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary, the Kumbh Mela, and the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, announced by him recently.
The PM said negativity is spread easily, but there is a lot of good work being done in the country and asked people to “make positivity viral”.
“Spreading negativity is fairly easy,” the Prime Minister said, adding, “Some really good work is being done around us, in our society”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On the new year, Modi said, “Whether it is the life of a person, life of a nation, or the lifespan of a society, inspiration is the basis of progress”.
He asked people of the country to approach 2019 “imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals”.
In the 51st edition of his radio broadcast, Modi spoke about the importance of eating right, and with the upcoming Kumbh Mela in mind, stressed on the need for sanitation.
Modi said that during his recent visit to Prayagraj, he noticed “that the preparations… were progressing on a war footing”.
“This time, a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh and if during the event, sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide,” he said.
He said that the ‘Akshayvat’, a tree in in the Allahabad fort, will be open for darshan this time, which was “locked up in the fort for hundreds of years”.
The Kumbh Mela, he said was marked by the UNESCO as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”.
As people from over 150 countries are expected to visit the event, he said, ambassadors of several nations had witnessed the preparations and national flags of many countries were hoisted at the venue.
Modi said that at the conference of the Directors General of Police recently in Kevdia, he discussed with the top policemen about “what kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country”. He mentioned the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, and said that it will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any way.
Counting the successes of 2018, Modi spoke about Ayushman Bharat, and said that the “world’s biggest health insurance scheme was launched.”
He said that electricity reached each and every village of the country, global institutions accepted that India took strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace, the country’s first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi, the longest rail-road bridge — Bogibeel Bridge — was opened, and India’s hundredth airport at Pakyong commenced operations.
Talking about the Statue of Unity, built in honour of Sardar Patel, he mentioned that it is the tallest statue in the world.
He said that the United Nations Environment Award ‘Champions of the Earth’ was conferred upon India, and mentioned the first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance held in the country. Modi further noted that India saw “unprecedented improvement in the Ease of doing business rankings”.
In 2018, he said, India “successfully accomplished the Nuclear Triad, which means we are now armed with nuclear capabilities-in water, on land and in the sky as well”. India’s nuclear submarine INS Arihant carried out its first combat patrol recently.
A special mention was made of the “daughters of the country” who circumnavigated the globe through the Navika Sagar Parikrama. Modi also referred to achievements of Indian sportspersons at international events.
In 2019 India is celebrating Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, the Prime Minister said. At the Republic Day celebrations on January 26, the chief guest will be Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, “where Mohan transformed into the ‘Mahatma'” and where he had started his “first Satyagraha and stood rock steady against the apartheid”."

A fire broke out at the tent city of the Statue of Unity in Kevadiya early on Wednesday. No casualties were reported.
Fire department officials said the fire broke out at around 2.30 am at a godown in the tent city-II.
Three fire tenders were immediately rushed to the spot from the SSNNL office located 2 kms away to douse the blaze from spreading to the residential tents. According to the Fire officials, the blaze was controlled within an hour.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The godown stored various items kept as spare for the tent city where tourists are accommodated. The loss is estimated to go above Rs 30 lakh, officials said, adding that the final estimate of the damages is yet to be done.
The police along with Fire department officials and the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd officials have initiated an investigation to find out the exact reason behind the fire. The godown is located at cluster G of the tent city with no tents nearby. At the time of the incident, three staff members were sleeping in the godown but they managed to escape unhurt and also raised an alarm and informed the officials about the fire. Around 50 tourists were also lodged at the tent city at the time of the incident.
Notably, the tent city has become a preferred place to host national and international events to boost tourism in and around the Statue of Unity. In December last year, national DGP conference was held here which also saw the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and another national meeting of Election Commissioners of all states is scheduled on Friday at the tent city."

US President Donald Trump’s nearly 27-minute speech at the Namaste Trump event at Sardar Patel Motera Stadium here was dotted with some interesting examples to strike a local Indian connect. From Bollywood blockbusters like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge & Sholay to cricket stars Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Trump cited several examples to strike a local connect and drew loud applause.

Beginning his speech with “Namaste! Namaste!”, he went on to say, “This is a country that produces nearly 2,000 movies a year, from the hub of genius and creativity known as Bollywood. All over the planet, people take great joy in scenes of Bhangra music, dance, romance and drama, and classic Indian films like DDLJ and Sholay.”

Ahead of his maiden visit to India, Trump had shared a video on Twitter in which his face was morphed on the title character in the movie Baahubali. “Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!” he had tweeted while sharing the video. Prior to that, he had praised Ayushmann Khurrana’s latest release, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. On a tweet complimenting the movie for celebrating a same-sex love story on the celluloid, Trump last week commented “great”.

Interestingly, former US president Barack Obama had also referred to DDLJ during his 2015 visit to India when he quoted Shah Rukh Khan’s famous dialogue from the iconic film. “Last celebration here we celebrated festival of lights in Mumbai.

Trump also invoked Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel during his speech. Referring to Swami Vivekananda, he said, “While our nations have many differences, they are both designed and propelled by a fundamental truth, a truth that all of us are blessed with a divine light, that every person is endowed with a sacred soul. As the great religious teacher Swami Vivekananda once said, ‘The moment I stand in reverence before every human being, and see God in him, that moment I am free.’”
Speaking about the Statue of Unity, he said, “This is the country that built the tallest statue to honour the memory of the namesake of this stadium, the greatest Indian patriot, a native of this state, Sardar Patel.”

The United Nations considers it a marker of affordable Internet, Indians consume an average of it every day, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out in October that it now costs “less than a small bottle of cold drink in India”. It actually costs under Rs 3. For that price, you can now get data that helps you stream a full Bollywood film in HD quality, or 200-odd songs.
In 2017, the cost of 1 GB in India, at 1.53 per cent of gross national income per capita, was the cheapest among all 61 low- and middle-income countries, making it among the most competitive mobile markets. The UN considers Internet affordable if this price is 2 per cent or lower.
As cheaper Internet gets more and more online, the numbers have been telling: after making up the largest chunk on Facebook (294 million) and WhatsApp (200 million), Indians now comprise the second-largest smartphone market in the world (40.4 million units last quarter). And yet, almost 70 per cent of India’s 1.25 billion population is not yet covered by the Internet.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In those numbers lies the India story, of a yearning demand and a yawning gap. Both played out to equal effect in 2018, a year that saw the schisms of old resurface in Dalit and farmer protests across the country, while the march of the new saw lynchings sparked by rumours on WhatsApp and use of social media to rally support during the Kerala floods. And if the Internet’s powers were evident in MeToo, political parties are bracing to face the might of it heading into perhaps India’s first social media election. In attempts to tame the beast, both WhatsApp and Facebook have made amends, by limiting forwards and committing to fight fake news. The year ended with news that the government was planning amendments to make it mandatory for online platforms to “proactively” deploy technology to ferret out “unlawful” content.
For this New Year issue, The Sunday Express tries to tell the story of India online, and of India 2018, through people caught in its stories, and their smartphones — from a young Dalit in Bhima Koregaon worried about caste posts, to a priest in Ayodhya with his travel apps; an NRC applicant who is now a YouTube star, to a flood-hit fisherman interested in graphic designing; a domestic help who can’t read and uses speech-to-text app, to a youth in Shopian searching chess contests; an Agra reporter facing her MeToo, to a person on 417 WhatsApp groups celebrating Sec 377 freedom; Zeb of Rakbar’s village who says phones as political sop only helps the Ambanis, to Gulab looking for job ads in Dhule, where 5 were killed on suspicion of being child-lifters; an MP farmer’s son looking for information related to agriculture, to a woman in TN seeking colleges; a guard at the tallest statue in the world with his ringtone of a Punjabi song, to a CRPF jawan navigating Bastar on Oruxmaps; and the unemployed in Bulandshahr seeking marital advice, to the migrant in Delhi with his frequent calls to his brother.

A DALIT rally near Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018, to mark the bicentennial celebration of a battle, had led to caste clashes and Naxalism charges against several organisers and supporters. Athawale is a B.Sc, Hotel Management student. The Dalit family, including his parents and two younger brothers who are also studying, makes around Rs 3 lakh annually.

We have become too dependent on our phones. I used to take tuition for a kindergarten child. He would always be glued to his phone. He even knew how to work the Internet. At home, when there is a family get-together, most people don’t talk; they are only staring at their screens.

A resident of Kakod village in Bulandshahr district, Sharma works part-time as a priest, officiating at weddings, earning an average of Rs 4,000 a month. However, he has failed to secure a full-time job for several years now and calls himself “berozgaar (unemployed)”, a demographic that has challenged the state and the Centre — the International Labour Organization put the number of unemployed in India at 1.86 crore in 2018, an upward revision from an earlier estimate. Divorced from his first wife and separated from the second, Sharma lives with his parents and two brothers. The annual income of the family is about Rs 1.8 lakh.

‘Women need phones. It makes us feel safe’
Manasi Chemai | 38 | ASHA worker in Cuttack, Odisha
Chemai lives in the Khan Nagar area of Cuttack with her mother and sister. She works as an ASHA worker, earning Rs 5,000 a month. Chemai dropped out of school when she was in class 9 following the death of her father, who was suffering from an unknown illness, which she now believes to be malaria. In its World Malaria Report 2018, the World Health Organization specially mentioned the role Odisha’s ASHA workers played to deliver anti-malaria services in rural and remote parts of the state.
The phone

Chemai uses an Intex Indie 44, which she bought for Rs 4,700 last year. She has a pre-paid plan of Rs 99, which includes unlimited talk time. As she is an ASHA worker, her phone bill is paid by the government. The phone doesn’t have a wallpaper as Chemai does not know how to set one. She prefers the old-fashioned land phone ringtone.

Only one. The group is for ASHA workers and its name is ‘Mahila Arogya Samiti’. All ASHA workers in the city are members of the group.
Last shared or received political message on phone

Source of news

I don’t read news on the phone. In fact, I don’t watch much news on television too.
Disturbing content on social media 

I don’t have any social media account. But I have heard of Facebook. Every day, I travel about 7-8 km on foot to do my rounds. I often hear that people use their phones to send objectionable pictures of women and girls. The police should take actions against those who indulge in such things.

Phone resolution for 2019

I haver no plans to buy a new phone next year.
Phone as a political sop

Mobile phones are very important. If the government hands phones as sops, I would thank them. Women need phones. It makes us feel safe. My mother and sister feel safe because they can call me whenever they want to check on me and vice-versa. Pregnant women, who need my help, call me immediately instead of pleading others to take them to the hospital. Sometimes, when I need to check on women about their nutritional supplements, I just call them.
Phone as a social problem

Yes, they are. I see some people chatting all day long on their phone and wasting time. But I use them mostly for work. So that is fine.

Fake news. There have been instances where I have alerted the sender. Once I received a message from someone quoting the Army chief as saying, ‘Tourists must not visit Kashmir. It is not a place to enjoy because of disturbance.’ I know an Army officer would never send a message like that. I alerted the sender and he apologised to me.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Statue of Unity a living example of how development and environment can thrive together. While addressing a rally in Kevadia colony to mark the Namami Devi Narmada Mahotsav, that coincided with his 69th birthday, he said,  “In our culture it is always believed that along with protecting the environment, development is possible as well. Since today morning I have visited a lot of places and every place I have seen the amazing coordination between environment and development. On one side is the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Hydropower turbines and on the other side there is cactus garden, butterfly garden, eco tourism and others.”
He stated that the Sardar Sarovar Dam reaching its Full Reservoir Limit (FRL) is an achievement in itself when earlier there was a time when the level could only reach 122 metres. “This is a laudable achievement. And this will be the inspiration which will help accomplish the Jal Jeevan mission and promote a movement towards the success of water conservation in the country. The various people’s movement from the state for water conservation is commendable and should be promoted at a national level as well,” he said.
For the first time, the Sardar Sarovar Dam reached its maximum capacity level of 138.68 metres. To celebrate this occasion, Namami Devi Narmada Mahotsav was organised by the state government across the state on Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In 2017, on September 17, Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated the Sardar Sarovar Dam project. Since then, gates were opened for the first time this year as water levels in Narmada river rose due to heavy rainfall in the catchment area in Madhya Pradesh.
After he reached Kevadia in the morning, he first visited and inspected various constituent tourist attraction spots developed around the Statue of Unity including the cactus garden, the butterfly garden, safari park, and river rafting and then performed the Narmada arti before addressing the rally.
In his address he recollected the time when acute water scarcity was a major issue in the state and stated how women walked for 5-10 kilometer daily to fetch water, families from Kutch and Saurashtra migrated to other cities and in the year 2000 for the first time a special water train was started to provide water to Jamnagar, Surendranagar, and Bhavnagar. Maintaining that the state has come a long way since then, Modi said, “When you trusted me to power, we had two major responsibilities. One to expedite the work of the Dam for irrigation and drinking water and second to expand the Narmada network canal. Till 2001 the main canal was stretched across only 150 kilometer. Irrigation and Drinking facilities were incomplete. But today, in the last 17-18 years almost twice land has been brought under irrigation.”

He continued, “Area under drip irrigation and micro-irrigation was only 14000 hectares and only 8000 agricultural families could benefit from it. Today the area covered is 19 lakh hectares and around 12 lakh families are benefitted.”
He further went on to cite an IIM study that concluded that micro and drip irrigation had led to 50% water conservation, 25% reduction in use of fertilizer, 40% reduction in labour cost and 30% increase in crop produce which eventually led to an increase of Rs 15,500 in the per hectare income of each family, in Gujarat.
Emphasizing on the government’s goal to provide tap water to every household, Modi said, “Not only irrigation, but tap water provision to every household has also substantially increased. In 2001, only 26 per cent households had tap water availability in Gujarat. Today 78 per cent households have tap water facility. Taking inspiration from here, we have to achieve similar accessibility of tap water across the country .”
He also mentioned that similar to the Ghogha Dahej Ro Ro ferry services, a Mumbai Hazira Ro Ro ferry service is also under pipeline to boost water tourism in the state.
Talking about Statue of Unity and the footfall of more than 23 lakhs tourists so far in the last 11 months, Modi said, “At an average, SoU sees a footfall of 8.5k tourists. If we compare it with the Statue of Liberty, it sees a footfall of 10k tourists every day and it is 133 years old. But 8.5k tourists on an average daily at SoU in just 11 months talks volumes about its popularity. With all the new tourist attractions coming up in the area, not only tourist attractions will increase but also employment opportunities for the local residents here.
He also mentioned that on this day in 1948, Hyderabad had agreed to be a part of India, and how “India has again accomplished the dream of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.”
“Today India is trying to complete all the tasks that have remained incomplete since independence. For 70 years the people of Jammu and Kashmir were discriminated and the entire country suffered in the form of violence and incomplete aspirations.

These cross-border tunnels, according to Intelligence sources, were initially dug by a Pakistani smuggler. As time passed, the tunnels have grown “sophisticated”, with help from Pakistan Rangers.

Around 20 lions in Gir (east) wildlife division were killed in the last two months following an outbreak of babesiosis.
“We have lost some animals because of the disease caused by blood protozoa called babesia, which, in turn, spreads through tick infestation and mite bite,” a top officer of Gujarat forest department told The Indian Express on Wednesday adding that they are trying to contain the outbreak.
A section of the local media has been reporting for almost a fortnight that lions are dying under mysterious circumstances in Gir (east) wildlife division spread across Amreli and Gir Somnath districts and that more than 20 big cats have died in such a manner over the past two months. The officer told The Indian Express that most of the recent deaths of the endangered species from Tulsishyam, Jasadhar and Hadala ranges of Gir (east) forest division have been caused by babesiosis .https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Incidentally, a babesiosis outbreak had coincided with the outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV) in Sarasiya range of Gir (east) in September, 2018. The combination of the viral and protozoal infections had killed around two dozen lions before Gujarat forest department imported CDV vaccine from the US and vaccinated almost all lions in the Gir forest and other protected areas. Forest officers said that babesia protozoa attacks red blood cell of lions, leading to anaemia. An anaemic animal becomes susceptible to other diseases like CDV.
“It was established in 2018 that CDV and babesiosis were a combination. It is like COVID-19, which alone doesn’t kill many. But if one already has comorbidity, then it proves deadly,” the officer added.
The officer further said that once an animal survives CDV infection, it develops life-long immunity against the virus and the outbreak already seems under control. “We have adopted a multi-pronged approach. We are de-worming livestock of cattle-herders (which forms a significant portion of the diet of Asiatic lions). We are disinfecting their enclosures where ticks and mites could be there. We are also burning grass and hay around water holes,” said the officer.
The officer further added that antibiotics are administered to the lions stricken by babesiosis and normally the treatment goes on for around five days. “We have already managed to successfully treat six animals. Also, there hasn’t been any deaths due to the disease for almost a week now. Now, our approach is to treat the animals in the wild itself,” added the officer.
Asiatic lions have been categorised as an endangered species by International Union on Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The only wild population of this species of big cats in the world is found in Gir forest and other protected areas spread across Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

He also asked them to stay away from limelight and go beyond their routine jobs to establish their identity. Modi was addressing the probationers through video conference from Kevadiya in Gujarat’s Narmada district, where he paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the Statue of Unity on his 145th birth anniversary earlier in the day.
“The turn at which the country stands today…the role of bureaucrats like you is of minimum government and maximum governance. You have to ensure that your interference in common people’s lives is reduced and that they get empowered,” he said.
“I would also request that whatever decision a civil servant takes should be in the national interest and aimed at strengthening the unity and sovereignty of the country and keeping India’s constitutional spirit high,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Your area may be small, the limit of the department under you may be small, but there should be national perspective in your decisions,” he said.
“A government does not run on policies alone. People for whom the policies are meant need to be involved. People are not the receiver of the government policies and programmes. They are the real driving force,” he said, adding that the probationers should aim to move from government to governance.
“You will face two ways- one of comfort, name and fame, while another of struggle, difficulties and problems. But I can tell you from my experience that you will face real difficulties when you choose the easy way out,” he said.
Modi said the probationers were entering the service at a crucial juncture when India is about to enter the 75th year of Independence.
“You will be at a crucial juncture of you career 25 years later when the country celebrates its 100th independence day. These 25 years between 75th and 100th years of Independence are a lot. And you are the people who will be part of the most important administrative system.
“You have a big responsibility in the coming 25 years to ensure the country’s safety, security, welfare of the poor and farmers, women and youth, and India’s proper position at the global level,” he said.
He said that Sardar Patel used to call bureaucrats the ‘steel frame’.
“The role of a steel frame is not just to support the system, but also to remind the country that they will fulfil the responsibility of taking the country forward successfully amid big crisis and difficulties like a facilitator,” Modi added.
The prime minister said that achieving the big aim of nation building and making India self-reliant may not be easy.
“When you go ahead facing all the challenges and work constantly to provide ease of living to people, then the results will be for the country to see,” he said.
He said they should not work with the aim of coming into limelight but by remaining anonymous.
He asked them to stay away from “dikhaas aur chhapaas” (craving for getting published in newspapers and to be seen on TV) and not forget their own social roots.
Modi said they should do more than their routine job to establish their identity.
He also asked the probationers to think about their role in fulfilling the dream of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’
“Sardar Patel dreamt of ‘Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat’. His dream was attached to the idea of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” he said.
“During the coronavirus pandemic, we have learnt a big lesson of self-reliance,” he said, adding that the country also became an exporter of defence equipment for which it was once dependent on other countries.
He said the government is giving emphasis on the human resources and modern training as well as development of new skill-sets for government servants, which, he said was not done in the past.
According to Modi, ‘Mission Karmayogi’ is a new experiment in capacity building for government servants.
He also asked them to adopt self-reliance and become “vocal for local” by stopping the use of objects of foreign origin used in daily lives.
“We should start from ourselves to make India self-reliant,” he said."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that his government would open museums in different parts of the country to honour the contribution of tribals who fought for India’s freedom. He made the announcement after laying foundation stone for one such museum at Sadhu Bet near Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in Narmada district. Sadhu Bet is a small island on river Narmada where the Gujarat government is building Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 182 meter tall statue.
“Some people think that India got independence because of some selected persons. Only they were showered with praises and received all the credit,” the PM said while dedicating the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Dabhoi. “In reality, many tribals sacrificed a lot while fighting numerous battles for India’s independence between 1857 to 1947. Tribals from all corners of the country fought bravely. I strongly believe that these tribals must get the respect. Future generations must know their contribution,” he said. “To honour such tribals, we want to build museums in all those states where tribals fought for independence between 1857 and 1947. Today, I got the chance to lay foundation stone for one such museum. I am confident that more such museums will be opened at other places in future,” he said.
Before addressing a large gathering here, he visited Sadhu Bet to take stock of the ongoing work on Sardar Patel’s statue. Modi exuded confidence that the ‘Statue of Unity’ will become a major tourist attraction after its completion. “As you know that it’s not in my nature to think or do anything on a small scale….That is why we had decided to build this 182 meter tall statue. Mark my words. It will become a major tourist destination, as lakhs of tourists will come here,” he said."

Describing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as “pro-business and pro-trade”, Union Minister for Railways Piyush Goyal said on Friday that India will be among the top 50 nations in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” rankings by the end of the five-year term of Narendra Modi government.
Talking about the “remarkable legacy of Sardar Patel” at a “Support and Outreach” programme organised for MSMEs in Gujarat, Goyal said, “He was considered to be very pro-business and pro-trade. He was basically a farmer, but he understood that it was important to promote trade to improve the country’s economy; to promote new opportunities of work for the countrymen. He knew that if industry and trade do not grow rapidly, then even the farmer’s life will remain incomplete and his income will also not increase… When farmers and businesses progress together, only then the country grows. These were Sardar Patel’s thoughts. And only yesterday you would have seen how India has jumped to 77th rank in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.”
“In just four years, we are in the top 80 and by the end of the fifth year, I have full confidence that we will be among the top 50 in the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ rankings. I want to tell you that even this was imagined by Sardar Patel about 70 years ago. Sardar Patel used to say to people that we should work hard towards making it easy for business and trade,” he added while pointing out how India jumped 23 places to No. 77 in the “Ease of Doing Business 2019” rankings.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At the event that was held to show PM Modi’s speech live to the MSME sector in Gujarat, Goyal also read out a statement from Sardar Patel. “We must encourage Indian insurance companies, banks and other enterprises and persuade others to do the same. Only by using their goods and services and making helpful suggestions, we can help them making them better,” the minister said, quoting Patel at Gujarat University Convention Hall, which was half empty by the time PM Modi began speaking.
He said PM Modi has improved the economy of the country, has tried to create a framework for an “honest system” and tried to improve the financial conditions of banks and strengthen them. “If there was one goal behind all this steps, then it was to ensure how MSMEs, farmers and small borrowers could easy and cheap access to finance,” he added.
“Everybody in Gujarat know that whenever the Prime Minister does any work, he does not do simple things. It is always extraordinary. It has to be different… You all would have experienced that his work is all about speed, skill and scale. These three things are part of this work,” Goyal said, praising Modi for the Statue of Unity, at the event which was largely attended by bankers and seven BJP MLAs.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
A youth, Sanabhai Thakore attending the event told The Indian Express that he was a clerk at the Dholka panchayat and had accompanied Aanganwadi workers to the event. “There are about 40 anganwadi workers from Dholka attending this event here,” Thakore said."
"1618505133-1027","https://indianexpress.com/page/33/?s=%22Statue+of+unity%22","The Splash: What keeps the Narendra Modi marketing machine ticking?","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/the-splash-what-keeps-the-modi-marketing-machine-ticking/","The Splash: What keeps the Narendra Modi marketing machine ticking?","Updated: May 1, 2014  10:49:08 am","It’s hard to miss the white lotus on the famed chhappan inch ki chaati as BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi addresses one rally after the other. The flower, strikingly different from the BJP’s official saffron-and-green lotus, made its debut on the lapel of Modi’s trademark half-sleeve kurtas on April 7, the day polling began for the 2014 general elections. “The white lotus is a replica of the lotus that appears on EVMs (electronic voting machines). It has a strategic purpose,” says a top Modi aide.
The idea, he explains, is that constant exposure to the quiet yet prominent logo will help it seep into the subconscious of the voters and they will go for it instinctively when they stand in front of an EVM on election day. This is subliminal advertising, the science of influencing consumers at a subconscious level, a relatively new domain of marketing.
	
	
		
			
While the Modi campaign’s use of social media has been much talked about (the 40,000 tweets and Facebook entries every day, Modi’s exclusive YouTube channel and the live streaming of his public addresses), behind the scenes, it has rolled out an elaborate offline, or traditional, poll drive that has employed every trick in the marketing trade: subliminal advertising, catching ’em young, going glocal (a global brand learning local tricks), crowd-sourcing, analytics, primary and secondary market research, above- and below-the-line advertising, brand placement, content integration, activation and consumer engagement. These are conventional and contemporary marketing practices that brands across the world use to become the favoured choice of their consumers. Add to these the smart use of technology (3D holograms used in Modi’s rallies or the use of DTH services to address voters in remote areas) and the result is that you can’t shut out Modi this election season.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“In an era of information overload, you overload an already overloaded people. This isn’t great marketing,” says Congress leader and Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari.
Modi’s strategists, however, insist that this was what they intended. “Every touch point with voters was critical for us. We aimed to connect with them wherever they were, and hence the use of TV, print, radio, hoardings, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp, DTH, cable TV services, on-ground and off-line people-connect initiatives,” says the person leading Modi’s marketing and communication brigade.
The giant marketing machine hasn’t stopped since it was turned on last September, only shifting gears when needed. The use of diverse platforms ran the risk of sending out disparate messages but team Modi claims to have driven the communication in a manner that it has always been a unified message that came from all platforms at every stage.
When Modi began his campaign with attacks on the UPA, it was because his analytics, research and on-the-ground teams had gone through several sets of economic and social data that showed people across the country were unhappy with price rise and corruption, while poverty and women’s safety were their top concerns. So his mainstream media slogan — mehengai, garibi, bhrashtachaar aur naari par atyachaar – janata maaf nahin karegi (people will not forgive inflation, poverty, corruption and exploitation of women) — echoed that message. The online team co-ordinating discussions on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and on-the-ground group managing events such as chai pe charcha picked up the theme. Chai pe charcha, incidentally, has so far been organised in more than 2,000 locations across 600 cities.
From attacks on the UPA, when Modi moved to the topic of good governance, the line of advertising promptly changed to‘achche din aane wale hain (happy days will be here again) and ‘Modi aane wala hai’. The conversation on other platforms too shifted. Since last week, he has been speaking of the need to have a stable government and his new advertising tagline is, ‘sthir sarkaar, Modi sarkaar (stable government, Modi government)’.
Any guesses why after giving the media the slip for a long time — with the exception of a select few interviews — Modi gave out a flurry of interviews to a host of newspapers and news channels last week? The interviews were scheduled after a survey has revealed that there was greater acceptability for Modi in the mainstream media.
Team modi
 
Political strategists
Instead of relying on party machinery or deliberating with senior party leaders, Modi works closely with a handful of people borrowed from the RSS and three of his trusted ministers from Gujarat.
Backroom boys
Administration and coordination with different Modi teams is carried out by three of his secretaries operating out of Gandhinagar — chief principal secretary K Kailashnathan, additional principal secretary A K Sharma and principal secretary G C Murmu — and resident commissioner in Delhi Bharat Lal.
Campaign strategist
The blueprint of Modi’s marketing and communication strategy has been drawn by Citizens for Accountable Governance. CAG is the brainchild of Prashant Kishore, a former UN mission chief in Africa, a public health exponent and a statistics whiz, who has been working with Modi for the past three years. CAG employs 200 full-time and more than 1,000 part-time volunteers.
Communication managers
Modi’s digital strategy, including his social media campaign, is managed by his former OSD Hiren Joshi, a former RSS man. The mainstream campaign — TV, print and radio ads — is managed by Manoj Ladwa, a London-based mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer , said to have played a crucial role in getting the UK to open its doors to Modi. While the media planning is handled by marketing communications agency Madison and advertising veterans such as Piyush Pande and Prasoon Joshi are providing creative inputs for the campaign, Ladwa supervises the whole process from an office in Lodhi Road, New Delhi.
Nuts &  bolts
Analytics as a tool
A bunch of engineers and statisticians analyses data of the past six elections, fuses it with demographic, socio-economic and their own opinion poll data, and slices it to the level of polling booths across 400 constituencies. This is analytics, a tool employed by hardcore market research and digital companies, and the Modi team says it helped them get a nuanced picture of patterns, issues and voters’ inclinations. The analytics team is in constant touch with other teams, using their real-time inputs, blending them with its own data and updating all teams on any changes in public mood, trends and issues. The analytics team even decides the routes to be taken by the Modi cavalcade, besides keeping an account of vehicles and drivers. “At any point in time, we have exact information on which vehicle is placed where and who is driving,” says a member of the team.
The big brains
The Citizens for Accountable Governance is a think-tank spearheading Modi’s marketing and communication push. It’s a central research team of policy analysts, economists, foreign policy experts and graduates from leading institutions across the world. The team has prepared reports on national policies and social and economic issues that have been discussed this election. It provides constant inputs for Modi’s speeches, social media conversations and chai pe charcha.
Mind reading
On-ground surveys and interviews spot electoral patterns and preferences — in short, internal opinion and exit polls. The information gathered is passed on to the analytics team that fuses it with its own data and other inputs from the research team. The team then analyses the data for trends and aberrations. This effort results in a Rapid Action Report, which presents a constantly evolving picture of a constituency. These inputs are passed on to Modi’s team and they use it to fine-tune his campaign.
Fanning out
Beyond TV commercials, print ads and radio jingles, the strategists conduct several events and programmes across the country, especially in rural areas, to build a direct connect with people.
The mainstream: A team of professionals operating out of New Delhi supervises commercial messages released to the mainstream media, besides buying space and time on various media platforms. Recently, it released a 75-second (the norm is 10 seconds) TV film during nine shows on Star Plus. Called ‘Roadblock’ in ad lingo, it was the only ad aired on those shows, blocking all other commercials. “It was an excellent way of capturing consumer mindspace without getting lost in the cacophony of commercial messages of various brands,” said a Star Plus insider. Besides, Modi’s messages play during popular TV shows on youth channels such as Channel[V].
The IT factor: A dedicated IT cell at the party level and Modi’s own team use Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube to spot friendly voices, reach out, train them and make them stakeholders of Brand Modi. Twenty lakh volunteers work to keep the Modi buzz alive online. Many are young and mid-career professionals from financial services, marketing, media and IT who have quit, taken sabbaticals or are simply devoting a few hours every day to the cause. ‘Modi4PM’, ‘NaMo4PM’, ‘NaMoChaiParty’, ‘Pledge4Modi’ are some of the campaigns they run.
On the ground: Several exercises help reach out to voters, such as chai pe charcha; the ‘Statue for Unity’ project; Sankalp, an initiative to address gender disparity; Manthan, an online and on-ground event with students asked to present “innovative solutions” to 14 “critical challenges the country faces”; Samvad, where volunteers interact with farmers; and Ivote, an initiative urging people to vote. The team running the project is also filing RTIs and organising online petitions to keep the buzz going."

As part of the preparations for the all-India DGP conference, which will be held next month at the Statue of Unity complex in Kevadiya colony of Narmada district, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Friday visited the site and reviewed preparations.
This is for the second time that the annual DGP conference will be held in Gujarat and will be presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
During his meet with the officials from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), Narmada district collector’s office and others, the Chief Minister set a deadline of December 15 to complete all the pending works and to add new tourist attractions like an aerial tour by helicopter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The three-day DGP conference will be held between December 20 and 22.
“Chief Minister proposed to start a two-seater helicopter tour of the place like the one at Niagara falls as an attraction for the tourists. For this, we have been asked to invite private players and finalise it. Apart from that the discussions pertained to enhancing facilities for tourists visiting the site — their stay and food. At the government rest houses we have been asked to accommodate non-government employees too. And even if someone is not staying there, they can still avail food facilities at the guest house. For all this, we have been given a deadline of December 15,” said Narmada District Collector R S Ninama.
According to L&T officials, managing the complex, they have been asked to expedite their work and complete the construction of the Sreshta Bharat Bhavan before December 15.
Sources also said that the Sardar Patel museum, located at the base of the statue, will see an overhaul before the DGP conference with additional inputs provided on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Rupani was accompanied by Chief Secretary J N Singh and Gujarat Sahitya Akademi chairman Vishnu Pandya.
To ease long queues, tourists now have been given specific time-slots for their visit, hence reducing the number of tourists within a certain time period.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

As most states are readying their annual budgets,in Gujarat,all bureaucrats – from chief secretary to heads of at least six other departments – are busy co-ordinating events for this mega project which is seen as a surrogate campaign for Chief Minister Narendra Modis prime ministership ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The officers maintained that daily work has been affected,with many undecided policies,bills and other decisions piling up. 
The state government has already planned to go for vote-on-account,instead of presenting a full-fledged budget,apparently because of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The reason: Modi and his Cabinet will be mainly busy in the campaigning. Besides,with the code of conduct likely to be placed soon,the Modi government may hold a short Assembly session before end of January itself.
Usually,the yearend,for any government department,is the busiest time – they prepare and send notes to the finance department for budget preparations. But,this time,they have other important assignment in hand. The seniormost bureaucrats,including Chief Secretary Varesh Sinha and six Additional Chief Secretaries,who head important departments – finance,energy,industries,forest,road and building – form the core team of member secretaries of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,a special-purpose vehicle floated to carry out the Statue of Unity project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
These officials,headed by a Cabinet minister and a host of other IAS and IPS officers in a batch of 25,have already been to nine states to accelerate the mobilsation,which includes Run for Unity (held on December 15),essay competition in nearly 2 lakh schools in Indias urban pockets and the collection of 5,000 metric tonne of iron pieces from 7 lakh villages across the country.
For Run for Unity,it was the Department of Youth and Culture that worked hard,with the support of an NGO named Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG),to ensure that 40 lakh people at 1,100 locations in India ran on December 15. For Statue of Unity,the office of development commissioner is preparing to dispatch 2 lakh letters,written by Modi in 11 regional languages,to the addresses of 2 lakh sarpanchs. The Science and Technology Department is busy preparing the digital material,including an electronic collage. 
The Agriculture and Cooperative Department is in constant touch with NGOs and social organisations that will spread out across India for mobilisation. The General Administration Department is busy preparing schedules for teams,from top bureaucrats to clerical staff,that will be travelling in batches across the country to promote the Statue of Unity.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The Revenue Department will ensure that no hurdle comes in the acquisition of land,the site of the  statue. The Education Department,like development office,will dispatch Modis letter to 2 lakh schools in urban pockets and see that schools organise essay competitions on the life and time of Sardar Patel. Its a simple process of overseeing the dispatch of letters and conducting essay competition. But the scale at which it has been planned demands a lot of time and energy, said a senior officer."

Modis announcement came on the eve of his completion of nine years as Chief Minister on October 9. A separate society formed under his chairmanship will monitor implementation of the idea,according to the BJPs official project brochure. It will be in the nature of a private-public partnership and will involve inviting suggestions from experts across the world.
To be located on Sadhu Bet in river Narmada,the memorial will be the tallest beyond comparison,reminding every onlooker not only of the freedom struggle but of the story of a united India. It will be a constant inspiration towards fulfilling the dreams of suraaj (good governance), said Modi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The proposed statue will be accessed by boat and visitors will be able to climb to the top in a lift to enjoy a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar dam and the surrounding hilly areas.
Modi said the idea was to immortalise Patels contribution as the architect of modern and united India,earlier divided into over 500 princely states. Thanking people of Gujarat and the country for the tenure of his government,he said the first decade of the 21st Century marked the development of Gujarat and this was his way of commemorating it.
He said the Statue of Unity would be one of a series of monuments to perpetuate the contribution of great personalities,others being the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar,Shyamji Krishna Verma memorial in Kutch and the Buddha relics as well as the international conference on Buddhism. He said the Statue of Unity complex would also present the history of the past 90 years through the use of modern technology.
The memorial would facilitate research in issues dear to Patel like good governance,agriculture technology and development for the tribal population,Modi said. It will be completed in about three years,excluding the time taken up by feasibility studies and searching for experts. He said the cost would depend on the type of material to be used as suggested by experts."

On the ambitious Statue of Unity project, Rs 27.6 crore has been spent so far, even as the actual construction work on the 182-metre-tall statue is likely to begin after monsoon this year. Of this, Rs 23.6 crore has been spent on a consortium of global consultancy services providing company, which was hired in August 2012 to provide design, engineering, project management and construction management services for the statue.
State Finance Minister Saurabh Patel announced a fund of Rs 500 crore for the project in the 2014-15 Budget other than Rs 100 crore allocated in the 2012-13 Budget. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley offered Rs 200 crore apart from declaring it a “National Project” during the Budget presented on July 10. The project is likely to cost in the upward of Rs 3,000 crore. Recently, infrastructure major, L&T Limited, won the bid to construct and maintain the statue for Rs 2,980 crore.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust has been managing activities related to the construction of the Statue of Unity since 2011, which include hiring global consultants and overseeing creation of a website and a “high-impact audio-visual multimedia presentation in multiple languages for the project”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An Ahmedabad-based media and communication service provider, Moving Pixel Company, developed the website and create an audio-visual multimedia for the statue at a cost of Rs 16.4 lakh.
The trust started off by putting advertisements inviting proposal for providing consultancy services. The advertisements were also placed in international media including The Financial Times and The Economists, with the aim to invite bids from global consultancy firms. Finally, a consortium comprising of three companies – Turner Project Management, Meinhardt India and Michael Graves & Associates Inc – was hired for the purpose.
A total Rs 11,383 was spent on the foundation laying ceremony for the project that was held on October 31, 2012 in Kevadia, attended by the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and senior BJP leader L K Advani. The details of expenditure incurred so far by the Trust on the Statue of Unity project was furnished by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) in response to an RTI application filed by a city-based activist, Rohit Prajapati.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The statue is coming up at Sadhu Bet, an island situated 3.2 kms downstream of Narmada dam at Kevadia. The SSNNL, in its reply to the RTI application, has maintained that no environment clearance or social impact assessment are required for the project. “Environment clearance is not required to obtain (for the project), hence environmental and social impact assessment of the project and its contribution to the cumulative impact of all the projects and activities in the area is not carried out,” it stated. However, activists have threatened to move the National Green Tribunal over environmental clearance for the project."

On Thursday, Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, chairman, National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, said that the country could match the previous season’s export record of 59 lakh tonnes. He said exports opened up late but the country could avail of the before April window to make the most. Post April, the Brazilian mills would start operations and dominate the international sugar markets. Dandegaonkar was addressing the media to announce the national efficiency awards for sugar factories across the country on Thursday. The federation has announced 21 awards for sugar factories, which will be given away at a special ceremony to held in the vicinity of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat on March 26.
Prakash Naiknavare, MD of the national federation, said the country has scope to contract more deals in February and March. “At present, India is the only player in the international market with sugar stocks. Brazilian sugar is likely to hit the market in April and this season, Brazil has decided to focus again on ethanol production instead of sugar production.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Naiknavare added that Indonesia has been a major importer and deals have been contracted to the tune of nearly 12 lakh tonnes so far. Some of the mills have also contracted deals under the Open General Licence (OGL) because of the demand for sugar in the market, he said.
Sanjay Khatal, MD, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation (MSCSFF), said that although exports were beginning to pick up pace, container availability continued to pose a challenge. “The Mumbai Port Trust’s port handling charges are around Rs 1,200 per tonne as against Rs 530-550 per tonne at Kandla port. A meeting was held with the officials of the Mumbai Port Trust and all the stakeholders to sort out the issue of port handling charges,” he said.
The millers are also seeking the correction of Minimum Support Price of sugar from Rs 31 per kg to Rs 38 per kg. Dandegaonkar said a decision is expected from the Centre on this issue in the next few days. Millers are unable to make cane payments to farmers because of high Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs 2,850 per tonne and low MSP of Rs 31 per kg, Dandegaonkar added."

Mansukh Mandaviya, the Union Minister of state for shipping, chemicals and fertilizers, said that a Gujarati will set up the first pharmaceutical unit in Kashmir. He was speaking to businessmen at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Saturday.
“I am confident… I also look after the pharmaceutical department, as well as chemicals and petrochemicals… the first pharmaceutical unit (in Kashmir) will be set up by a Gujarati,” said Mandaviya while speaking on “Business opportunities in Jammu and Kashmir.”
Pointing out how Gujarati firms were the first to take advantage of the relaxations offered by Himachal Pradesh to pharmaceutical industries a decade ago, the minister said, “Today half of the industries (in HP) are ours.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asking businessmen in Gujarat to keep an eye on opportunities in J&K, Mandaviya said job and business opportunities will slowly open up in Kashmir. “J&K will tread on the path of progress in the future,” he said, adding that Article 370 had given rise to “separatist tendencies” among the youths in Jammu and Kashmir and encouraged “terrorism”, which Pakistan had taken advantage of.
Mandaviya also claimed that foreigners who come to India now visit Delhi’s Akshardham and the Statue of Unity in Gujarat instead of the Taj Mahal. “Earlier when people used to come to Delhi, they were shown the Taj Mahal. Hindustan did not recognise it’s own strength. We ourselves never recognised it… When the world comes now, they first to go see Akshardham. They do not go to see the Taj Mahal,” he said."

An intelligence input has warned of a possible terror attack in Gujarat in the wake of the last week’s Pulwama bus bombing, prompting the state government to review overall security arrangements Monday.
Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani reviewed security arrangements and preparedness of the state police at a meeting in Gandhinagar where he sought views of top officials about the security set up at vulnerable places such as the Statue of Unity in Narmada district, the Sardar Sarovar Dam and Somnath temple among others.
A high alert has been sounded by the Gujarat Police after the state intelligence bureau provided an input about a possible terror attack, immediately after the February 14 Pulwama incident in which 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed, a police officer said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Another officer said it was a general input recommending tightened security at vital installations to avert any possible terror strike.
At the meeting, the chief minister reviewed the measures put in place by police, said state Chief Secretary J N Singh.
Besides Singh, state DGP Shivanand Jha, Home Secretary A M Tiwari, Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja and other senior officers of police and intelligence wing attended the meet.
“During the meeting, the CM took our views about the status of our preparedness as well as overall security arrangements at vulnerable places, such as the Statue of Unity, the Sardar Sarovar Dam and Somnath temple among others,” Singh said after the meeting.
He maintained that the intelligence input was of a general nature and did not pinpoint a specific target.
“At the meeting, we have apprised the chief minister about the overall security set up. After the Pulwama attack, our security set up must be intense and up to the mark,” the chief secretary said.
A total of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed and five injured in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14 when a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kgs of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district."

The government’s ambitious plans to connect Andaman and Nicobar Islands via water aerodromes have run into turbulent winds as the only operator to bid for the six water aerodromes in the union territory was not awarded the routes under UDAN due to “problems with paperwork”.
Even though there were four water aerodromes at Andaman and Nicobar up for bidding under the third edition of UDAN scheme — Havelock, Neil Island, Long Island and Hutbay — none of them were awarded during the announcement of the results the scheme on Friday. While a senior Civil Aviation Ministry official did not disclose the exact nature of paperwork issues with the sole bidder for these water aerodromes, it was learnt that the operator — Maritime Energy Heli Air Services Pvt Ltd — had been reached out to by the Ministry to seek the proper documentation, following which its bids would be reconsidered next month.
On Friday, the Civil Aviation Ministry awarded six water aerodromes under UDAN 3.0 that will be connected by seaplanes. These are Guwahati River Front and Umrangso Reservoir in Assam; Sabarmati River Front, Statue of Unity and Shatrunjay Dam in Gujarat; and Nagarjuna Sagar in Telangana.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


	ExplainedPromising project, but no signs of infrastructure yetTourism experts have predicted that seaplane operations within Andaman and Nicobar islands could unlock the region’s tourist potential, given the lack of enough connectivity between the islands. Even though the debut of seaplanes and water aerodromes is one of the key features of UDAN 3.0, the success of the plan will depend on how soon the infrastructure is made ready. Currently, India does not have a single operational commercial water aerodrome and neither of the two operators who have won rights to operate seaplanes under UDAN have amphibious equipment in their fleets.

The routes in Telangana have been awarded to Turbo Aviation, while the routes in Gujarat and Assam have been bagged by SpiceJet.

When asked about the readiness of seaplane infrastructure in the country, Civil Aviation Secretary R N Choubey said that the water aerodromes will be built by the Airports Authority of India. “The work will start. We expect that within six to eight months, we will be able to make it functional because water aerodrome does not require a runway. We basically have to prepare a jetty and a terminal building and we expect that in six to eight months we’ll be able to get it done,” Choubey said, in reference with the infrastructure for water aerodromes awarded on Friday.
However, another senior government official informed that since the concept of water aerodromes was a novel one, the Civil Aviation Ministry has requested the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security to prepare security standards that are suited for water aerodromes. The timeline for the preparation of these standards was not disclosed. Notably, on the regulation front, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has already issued the civil aviation requirements for seaplane operations.
To study the feasibility and ways to implement seaplane operations in the country, a team of senior officials of the Civil Aviation Ministry, the DGCA and the Airports Authority of India had visited The Maldives in December. Currently, Trans Maldivian Airways, a private airline based in Male, operates the world’s largest seaplane fleet comprising 50 aircraft.
Amphibious planes have the ability to take off and land from places that do not have landing strips and where no runway exists, thus reaching areas where there is no other mode of transport available. These smaller, fixed-wing aircraft can land on water bodies, gravel and grass.
Under the UDAN scheme, the government has listed two categories of seaplanes for receiving viability gap funding (VGF) — Category 1A for seaplanes with capacity less than nine seats and Category 1 for seaplanes with capacity of nine-twenty seats. The amount of VGF an operator would receive for seaplane operations will depend on which category their equipment falls into.
Under the UDAN scheme, the Centre aims to connect unserved and under-served airports. On the routes selected under the scheme, a fixed number of seats are sold at fares, for which a cap is decided by the government.
Airlines bid for routes with VGF they require to meet the costs and this funding is contributed by the Civil Aviation Ministry and respective State governments. Upon technical qualification, the airline with the lowest VGF bid is selected to operate on the route with a three-year exclusivity."

This Lok Sabha election, Gujarat broke a record on polling day when it clocked an all-time high turnout of 64.11%, breaking its 52-year-old record of 63.77% polling during the 1967 elections. Five years ago, amid a “Narendra Modi wave”, the would-be prime minister’s home state had polled 63.66%, missing the opportunity to mint a new record by a whisker. That wave election helped BJP romp home with all the 26 Lok Sabha seats from the state.
This year, despite no perceptible wave for any party or personality on the ground, Gujarat surprised pollsters with a record turnout. And the two main political parties in the state — the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress — were quick to call it a vote in their favour. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that the high turnout “indicates that there is a wave in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”. On the other hand, senior Congress leader Bharat Solanki, who is contesting from Anand constituency, said that his party, which had drawn a blank in 2014, will do well this time. “The people of Gujarat have come out in large numbers to vote out the BJP,” he said.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone wp-image-5700111 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/decision2019-gujarat-.jpg"" alt="""" width=""719"" height=""119"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/decision2019-gujarat-.jpg 719w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/decision2019-gujarat-.jpg?resize=450,74 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/decision2019-gujarat-.jpg?resize=600,99 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"" />But that would be over simplification. At face value, the high turnout figure suggests that the people in the state came out overwhelmingly to vote. But breaking down the number suggests that the increase in the voter turnout has not been uniform and homogeneous across the state. There are wide swings. For example, Banaskantha, a rural seat bordering Pakistan in north Gujarat, witnessed a jump of 6.15% in the voter turnout. While Kutch, that shares a good part of its border with Pakistan saw its voter turnout drop by 3.56% since 2014, ostensibly because of the drought. Rapar in Kutch, which has been hit by severe drought and has witnessed largescale migration of people, recorded a meagre 47.37% turnout. Kutch, overall, recorded 58.22% turnout. To its south, Surendranagar, another rural seat, witnessed a drop of nearly 5% in polling.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Coastal Porbandar, in deep south Saurashtra, however, saw its voter turnout increase by 4% than its 2014, but its overall figure — 56.79% — was still 8 per cent less than the state’s average.
But Urban Vadodara, on the other hand, saw a drop of 3% to 67.86%, and still three per cent higher than the state’s average.

Amreli, as usual, saw the lowest turnout at 55.75%, albeit with a 1.28% jump from 2014. Valsad, a tribal dominated seat in the south, continued to be the seat with highest turnout — 75.21% with a jump of nearly three per cent.
While some tribal dominated areas such as Dediapada Assembly segment of Bharuch Lok Sabha seat witnessed voting as high as 85.01%.
The turnout varied not just between one Lok Sabha constituency to another, but also within a single parliamentary constituency. Click here for more election news

Let’s take the case of Valsad, a tribal-dominated seat in south. Under this parliamentary constituency, there are seven Assembly segments — urban Valsad, Pardi and Umargam on the coastal side, and rural Vansda, Dharampur, Kaprada and Dangs in the forest side. While the tribal Assembly segments witnessed a huge turnout, as high as 83.16% in Kaprada, followed by 81.23% in Dangs, 78.96% in Dharampur and 77.01% in Vansda; the maximum turnout in the urban segments was only 70.63% (Valsad Assembly segment) — nearly 7% less than the least voting percentage in the tribal areas. The lowest turnout was in Umargam at 66.78%.
The vagaries in the turnout are not limited to a specific region, but is linked to demography, level of urbanisation, caste and community, and above all political influence of local leaders.
The Urban Matrix
Out of the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state, six are urban constituencies with the degree of urbanisation varying from 70% (Ahmedabad East) to 100% (Ahmedabad West). And then there are five other seats that have almost an equal mix of rural and urban areas, which we have categorised as “rural-urban”, such as Rajkot (50:50 urban, rural areas), Porbandar (65:35) etc. While polling in the six urban seats witnessed a drop, barring Surat and Navsari in south Gujarat, where there was an incremental jump, the five rural-urban seats, barring Rajkot, saw a jump.
In most of the urban constituencies, the turnout oscillated between 55-73%.
In Ahmedabad West, where all the 1,556 polling stations are located in urban areas, the polling percentage was among the lowest at 60.37% — a drop of 2.56% from the 2014 turnout. In this Scheduled Caste reserved seat, BJP’s Kirit Solanki, who is facing Congress’s Raju Parmar, is hoping for a third-time win. But different Assembly segments within this Parliamentary constituency saw the voter turnout varying between a high of 62.31% in the BJP bastion of Ellisbridge, which was won by the BJP in the 2017 Assembly polls, to a low of 56.89% in the minority-dominated Jamalpur-Khadia, won by the Congress in the last Assembly polls.

In Gandhinagar, where BJP president Amit Shah is contesting, the overall turnout matched exactly with that in 2014 — 65.57. However, here the highest turnout was in Sanand Assembly segment (71.09%), where Shah did his last roadshow before polls. The lowest turnout was in Gandhinagar North (62.39%). Gandhinagar constituency has a high number of OBC votes.
Vadodara, too, witnessed the sharpest drop of 3% in the turnout — from 70.94% in 2014 when BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi was contesting from the seat to 67.86% this year. The urban Assembly segments of Vadodara city, Sayajigunj, Manjalpur, Raopura and Akots recorded up to 4% drop as compared to 2014.
Notably, Waghodia Assembly segment, where BJP MLA Madhu Srivastav had threatened voters with consequences if they did not vote for BJP, has recorded the highest turnout at 73.1% among the seven Assembly segments of the Parliamentary constituency.
“If you see the trend, the voter turnout has been steadily declining in the last three polls,” a local BJP leader said. “There was an undeniable euphoria about the elections among voters and also party workers till Narendrabhai was (contesting from) here. So, 2017 polls saw a dip of about 2.5% in the voter turnout as compared to 2012 Assembly polls, and in this Lok Sabha elections, the polling has been lower than the 2017 Assembly polls in the same segments, as well as in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. It is certain that voters feel differently when Narendrabhai is here and when he is not,” the senior leader said.

However, the two urban constituencies that bucked the downward trend included Surat and Navsari, both in the south and located adjacent to each other. In both the constituencies, there was marginal improvement in the turnout — 0.51% in Surat (64.41%) and 0.28% in Navsari (66.10%). But within Surat too, the polling varied between the low of 55.53% in Karanj to the high of 70.28% in Surat West Assembly segment. Notably, in Patidar-dominated areas of Varachha Road and Karanj, voting was at its lowest.
In Navsari also, the areas dominated by Koli Patels, who have been traditional BJP voters but this time have opposed the ruling party, witnessed heavy turnout. For example, Koli Patel-dominated Assembly segments of Jalalpore, Navsari and Gandevi recorded 71.22%, 75.31% and 81.23%, respectively, whereas the rest of the areas recorded polling between 59% to 63%.
“For urban and semi-urban voters, who are not affected by farm crisis directly and who don’t have to worry about fetching water, the election campaign this time was dull for them, as Prime Minster Narendra Modi was not contesting from the state. It is a known fact that the BJP does better in urban constituencies. But the voter turnout was low in urban areas, which also indicates that those who have voted may not be happy with the BJP,” said a Congress leader in Vadodara.
The Rural-Urban Mix
While the urban seats recorded a dip in voting, the five rural-urban mix parliamentary constituencies, barring one, Rajkot, saw a jump in voting, with Porbandar recording a 4.17% increase in voter turnout, followed by Jamnagar with 2.71% jump. Notably, in both the seats of Saurashtra region, Assembly bypolls were being held simultaneously — Manavadar Assembly in Porbandar Lok Sabha seats and Jamnagar Rural in Jamnagar parliamentary constituency. Interestingly, heavy polling was witnessed in both the Assembly segments that seem to have improved the overall voting percentage in these two Lok Sabha seats.
In Porbandar Lok Sabha seat ( 65% rural, 35% urban polling stations), which recorded 56.79% turnout, the voting ranged from 49.56% in Kutiyana Assembly segment that was won by NCP in 2017 state polls, to 62.88% in Manavadar Assembly where bypoll was held after the incumbent Congress MLA quit the party to contest on a BJP ticket. Of the four Assembly segments here won by the BJP in 2017, two — Gondal (61.10%) and Jetpur (58.40%) — registered better voting, while the other two — Keshod (53.83%) and Porbandar (55.53%) — poor, with Porbandar segment witnessing a sharp decline of 9.24% voting as compared to 2017 Assembly polls. Even Congress candidate and MLA Lalit Vasoya’ s Assembly seat Dhoraji recorded only 55.56% turnout.

In neighbouring Jamnagar Lok Sabha seat (65% rural, 35% urban polling stations), which recorded third highest voting in Saurashtra at 60.70%, the maximum turnout was recorded at Jamnagar Rural Assembly segement (65.13), where bypoll was being held simultaneously. Here too, the Congress had won in 2017, but the MLA jumped ship. While urban Jamnagar North and Jamnagar South, two of the three Assembly segments of the BJP, recorded 63.63% and 63.11% polling, respectively; Congress segments of Jamjodhpur (59.76%), Khambhaliya (59.16%) and Kalavad (58.90%) witnessed comparatively lower turnout. However, the lowest voting (56.31%) was recorded from Dwarka Assembly seat, where BJP MLA Pabubha Manek’s election was set aside by the Gujarat High Court just a few days before the polling for the Lok Sabha election.
Rajkot, the only seat in agrarian Saurashtra which is most urbanised with 50:50 urban and rural polling stations, saw the highest turnout in the region with 63.15% voters exercising their franchise. But the polling was still slightly less (-0.74%) than 2014. In this seat dominated by Patidars and Kolis, Assembly segments won by the Congress saw an increased turnout, while those won by BJP in 2017 less. Tankara Assembly seat, represented by MLA Lalit Kagathara, who is also the Congress nominee for the Lok Sabha seat, topped with 67.64% turnout, followed by neighbouring Wankaner, another Congress pocket, at 66.09%. Assembly segments won by BJP recorded little less — Rajkot West (64.71%), Rajkot East (63.74%), Rajkot South (63.73%) and Rajkot Rural (61.47). Interestingly, the least turnout was recorded in Jasdan Assembly segment (54.35%) — 8.58% lower than 2014 and 19.6% drop from its 2017 state poll turnout when the seat was won by Congress leader Kunvarji Bavaliya, who last year quit the party and is now a BJP minister in the state.
The semi-urban constituency of Bhavnagar is among the two seats in Saurashtra-Kutch region where BJP holds a majority of Assembly segments — five out of seven. Overwhelmingly dominated by Koli voters, Bhavnagar recorded 0.83% increase in the voter turnout, with its two Assembly segments — Bhavnagar Rural and Bhavnagar East, both won by the BJP in 2017 — witnessing a rise of 5% polling. Among the two Assembly segments held by the Congress here, Talaja saw turnout rise by 2.91%, while Gadhda, a SC reserved seat, saw 1.39% slide in the turnout. But the steepest fall — 8.4% — was recorded in Botad, won by the BJP in 2017.

The Rural Matrix
Like urban constituencies, predominantly rural seats spread across the Saurashtra-Kutch region, also saw a dip in polling as compared to 2014, barring Amreli where senior Congress leader Paresh Dhanani is challenging incumbent BJP MP Naran Kachhadiya. However, the rural seats in central and north Gujarat witnessed an increase in voter turnout.
Saurashtra-Kutch
The agrarian region of Saurashtra-Kutch had played a pivotal role in the resurgence of Congress in the state during the 2017 Assembly polls. The Opposition party had managed to win 31 out of the 54 seats in Saurashra-Kutch, thereby reducing the BJP’s tally in the region to only 23. However, one and half years later, there has been a widespread depression in voting in the region.
To begin with, the Congress had won six of the seven Assembly segments of Surendranagar Parliamentary constituency in 2017. Dominated by Kolis, who account for nearly one-third of voters, and Dalits forming the second largest group, this constituency recorded the sixth lowest turnout in the region with 57.85% polling and also the steepest decline — 5.08%. Dhrangadhra, where a bypoll was held simultaneously with Lok Sabha elections, polled maximum (61%), followed by Viramgam (59.43%). Wadhwan, the lone Assembly segment won by the BJP here in 2017, saw 57.66% turnout.
Junagadh, another Koli-dominated seat, recorded a fall in voter turnout — 2.69%. Here too, the Congress had performed phenomenally well in the 2017 state elections, winning all its seven Assembly constituencies. But this time, the voter turnout dipped as compared to 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Barring Junagadh Assembly segment, which recorded a marginal rise (0.08%) in turnout (59%), all the remaining six segments recorded a dip — Visavadar (-3.2%), Mangrol (-0.5%), Somnath (-4.6%), Talala (-3.8%), Kodinar (-3.32%) and Una (-2.55%).
Despite the fall in turnout, Junagadh Parliamentary constituency recorded the second highest polling among the eight seats in Saurashtra-Kutch region, while Somnath Assembly segment witnessed 70.85%, the highest turnout among all the Assembly segments in the region.
Though Amreli recorded merely 55.75% polling, it saw a jump of nearly 2% voter turnout. Out of the seven Assembly segments, five are with the Congress, and the remaining two with the BJP. But here too, Congress pockets were outpolled by a BJP seat — Mahuva polled maximum (63.63%). Notably, the least polled among the Assembly segments was also held by the BJP — Gariyadhar (52.08%).
Among the Congress pockets, Dhari saw a jump of 4.11% in polling, followed by Amreli (+2.74%) and Rajula (+3.89%). However, Lathi, held by Congress, saw a major fall of 9.64%.
“There are no avenues of employment here. Nor is there much work in agriculture and the district is going through a drought and therefore people from Amreli are forced to migrate to Surat and Ahmedabad. Moreover, the internal disputes of the BJP led to lower enthusiasm among the BJP supporters,” Dhanani said, adding that the 7.07% higher polling in the BJP seat of Mahuva was also in his favour.
But Raju Dhruv, BJP spokesperson for Saurashtra and Kutch region, said the contrary was true. “The fact that BJP segments have recorded higher turnout will go in favour of our party. These are not anti-incumbency votes. BJP voters thronged polling booths and voted for Narendra Modi. On the other hand, Congress has no party organisation and therefore it could not even mobilise its supporters to the polling stations,” said Dhruv.
Central Gujarat
The two rural seats of central Gujarat — Anand and Kheda — however, saw an increase in voter turnout.
Anand, which has been a Congress stronghold, polled 66.79% — a 2% jump in voter turnout as compared to the Lok Sabha elections held five years ago when the BJP won from here.
Notably, five of the seven Assembly segments here have shown a higher turnout as compared to 2014, with four belonging to the Congress. While most of the Assembly segments in this constituency reported more than 60% turnout, state Congress chief Amit Chavda’s Assembly constituency of Anklav reported a whopping 70.97% turnout as against 67.24 in 2014. Anklav had registered 76% turnout in the 2017 Assembly polls, helping Chavda retain his constituency. Another constituency that recorded higher turnout was Petlad, which was won by the Congress in 2014.
The semi-urban segment of Anand, which the Congress won in 2017 from the BJP, however, saw a 4% drop in voter turnout with 65.14% polling. Here the Congress has fielded party veteran Bharatsinh Solanki once again from the seat. Against him, the BJP has pitted debutant Mitesh Patel, after dropping its sitting MP Dilip Patel.
In neighbouring Kheda, where BJP MP Devusinh Chauhan is seeking re-election, the turnout jumped by 0.82% to 60.68%. Most of the other six rural Assembly constituencies showed similar trends of up to 1.5% increase in polling. But in the semi-urban segment of Nadiad, which is a BJP bastion, voter turnout slipped to 59% — a 4% drop from 2014. In 2017, five of the seven Assembly segments of this constituency were won by the BJP.
The Congress, which had been winning the seat since 1977 until Chauhan won in 2014, may have a reason to worry again. The party’s decision to field former BJP leader Bimal Shah, who joined the party earlier this year, has not gone down too well with the district unit. Ahead of the nominations, Kapadvanj MLA Kalu Dabhi had threatened to resign. The party had also seen a revolt in Mahuda where MLA Indrajeet Thakor was seeking a ticket. Both Kapadvanj and Mahuda recorded under 60% voter turnout. “Although veteran party leaders like Dinsha Patel had spoken to the miffed leaders, they haven’t worked as hard on the ground this time, and it is visible. Kapadvanj is also a stronghold of the candidate Bimal Shah himself, so it has fared better as compared to Mahuda. But it is pretty obvious that our workers weren’t able to motivate voters. However, we are looking at seats held by the BJP and there is not much difference. It will be a tight contest,” said a Congress leader.
BJP leaders are, however, confident that the scale will tilt in their favour. “Not just in Kheda but also in Anand, BJP will win. We are extremely confident of it regardless of the voter turnout, “ said a BJP leader.
The Anomalies
Banaskantha & Patan
The two Lok Sabha constituencies in north Gujarat —Banaskantha and Patan — recorded the highest jump in the voter turnout, 6.15% and 3.24%, respectively, even as all the seats in the region witnessed a drop in polling. Notably, both the seats are dominated by Thakors and Ahirs (Chaudhary), both OBCs and involved in farming.
While in Banaskantha, both the BJP and the Congress candidates are Chaudharys or Ahirs, in Patan the two main contenders — Bharatsinh Dabhi (BJP), Jagdish Thakor (Congress) — belong to the Thakor community.
Among the seven Assembly segments of Banaskantha Parliamentary constituency, Tharad, dominated by Chaudhary Ahirs, polled the maximum (71%) with a jump of 9.2%. BJP candidate for Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat, Parbat Patel, had won from Tharad in 2017. Another Assembly segment that recorded the highest jump was Deodar (9.32%) which was won by the Congress in the last Assembly polls. However, the total turnout in this Assembly segment was 64.66%, nearly 6.5% less than Tharad. Another Assembly segment that recorded higher turnout was Danta, a tribal-dominated seat, with 69.67%.
However, despite a higher polling percentage, areas dominated by Thakors registered a low turnout in Banaskantha. Thakors, who had voted for the Congress in large numbers in 2017 Assembly elections following the entry of youth leader Alpesh Thakor into the party, seemed disenchanted due to two factors — fielding of Chaudhary Ahirs by both the BJP and Congress, and exit of Alpesh Thakor from Congress just in the middle of the Lok Sabha campaign.
“Also, migration for work is higher among the Thakor community. So, most of them don’t return to their native places for voting. Unlike in the Assembly elections, where the constituency area is smaller, party workers do not take much pain in bringing voters to the booth during the Lok Sabha elections,” a local BJP functionary said.
In neighbouring Patan, where Alpesh Thakor’s Assembly constituency Radhanpur is located, the voter turnout stood at 61.98%. Here, Kheralu Assembly segment, which has a maximum Thakor votes — almost double than the Chaudhary votes, recorded the highest voting at 65.88%. The highest jump (8.38%) in the voter turnout was recorded in Koli-dominated Kankrej Assembly segment that registered 60.44% polling.
However, no wide variation was witnessed in the polling percentage in all the seven Assembly segments of Patan Lok Sabha seat. The polling percentage varied between 60% to 65%. The seat which flip flops between the BJP and Congress was won by the ruling party in 2014.
Unjha Assembly bypoll
While three of the four Assembly seats, where by-elections were held, recorded higher turnout, Unjha Assembly segment in Mehsana — the ground zero of the Patidar quota movement — reported a dip in voting. All the four Assembly seats were won by the Congress in 2017, but the MLAs quit the party one-by-one to join the BJP. In Unjha too, Asha Patel, who won on a Congress ticket in 2017 Assembly polls, quit the party to contest as a BJP nominee. While Mehsana Parliamentary constituency recorded a drop of 1.66% in its turnout (65.37%) as compared to 2014, the drop in the turnout in Unjha was nearly 5%. This time, Unjha recorded 67.36% voting, above Mehsana’s average, but far less than its 2017 turnout of 72%.
The highest turnout in Mehsana was recorded in Kadi Assembly segment, which was won by the BJP in 2017.
The Tribal Surge 
Gujarat’s tribal belt, which extends from Panchmahal and Dahod in the north to Valsad in the south, has been a traditional a high polling area. And this year it was no different. All the six Parliamentary constituencies in the belt recorded above 60% turnout, ranging from the low of 61.73% in Panchmahal to the high of 75.21% in Valsad. Barring two constituencies — Bardoli (73.57%) and Bharuch (73.21%) — all the other four registered a jump in voter turnout, from 3% in Valsad to 1.73% in Chhota Udepur.
The surge has been largely uniform, irrespective of party strongholds.
In Panchmahal, which recorded 61.73% turnout — an increase of 2.43% voting — Kalol Assembly segment, a stronghold of outgoing BJP MP Prabhatsinh Chauhan, recorded the highest turnout of over 70.25%, up by 5%. Interestingly, all three of the seven Assembly segments that are BJP strongholds in this constituency — Lunawada, Shehra and Kalol — have recorded over 4% increase in the turnout as compared to 2014. Lunawada and Morva Hadaf Assembly areas where the candidates — BJP’s Ratansinh Rathod and Congress’ VK Khant hail from, respectively— showed a jump of 6% voter turnout as compared to 2014.
In neighbouring Dahod constituency, reserved for STs, the voter turnout jumped by 2.33% in 2014 with remote tribal segments polling more than the last election as compared to the semi-urban segments. Here the contest is between sitting BJP MP Jaswantsinh Bhabor and former two-time BJP MP Babu Katara, who has been fielded by the Congress.
High turnout was recorded in the BJP-dominated Limkheda Assembly segment, where sitting MP Bhabor’s brother is an MLA, and Jhalod, where Katara’s son Bhavesh won as MLA in 2017 on a Congress ticket. Jhalod Assembly segment, which was retained by the Congress in 2017, showed a jump of 6% in turnout. Garbhada Assembly segment, which is a Congress stronghold, recorded a nearly 9% jump in turnout (66.18%). However, the urban segment of Dahod, which has a large population of Dawoodi Bohra Muslim, as well as businessmen, saw a 6% decline turnout.
The upward swing continued in Chhota Udepur constituency, wherein Dabhoi Assembly segment represented by BJP heavyweight Shailesh Sotta recorded 74.5% voter turnout. In Nandod Assembly segment, where the Statue of Unity is located and which was won by the Congress in the last Assembly elections, the voter turnout touched 76% — 1.5% higher than even the 2017 Assembly polls. Padra segment, which the Congress had won from the BJP in 2017, recorded 75.02% turnout — 4% higher than 2014.
With the voting patttern of Valsad already discussed at the onset, that leaves us with the two seats of Bardoli and Bharuch, which witnessed high turnout, but still less than 2014.
In Bharuch, where a triangular contest is at play with BTP founder Chhotu Vasava challenging the incumbent BJP MP Mansukh Vasava and Congress nominee Sherkhan Pathan, the voting dipped by 1.64%, this time. Paradoxically, Dediapada Assembly segment that falls under Bharuch Parliamentary recorded the highest turnout in the state at 85%. In last Assembly polls, it was 85.4% when sitting BJP MLA Motilal Vasava lost to Mahesh Vasava, son of Chhotu Vasava. Here too, like Valsad, there was a huge gap in polling between urban areas and tribal areas. Turnout in Bharuch, Ankleshwar and Jambusar remained in 60s, while it was 80% in Jhagadia, 73.52% in Karjan and 72.52% in Vagra — all tribal-dominated areas.
To its south in Bardoli, the turnout was 73.57%, a drop of 1.37% from 2014. In this ST reserved constituency, the contest is between incumbent BJP MP Prabhu Vasava and Congress’s Tushar Chaudhary. Here too, Nizar, Vyara and Mandvi Assembly segments — all tribal-dominated — voted 82.91%, 78.64% and 78.64%, whereas semi-urban Kamej polled the lowest with 62.62%.
The surge in the tribal votes has left many politicians baffled, with both the BJP and Congress claiming that it would benefit them. “The tribals are unhappy with the present BJP government as a lot of injustice has been meted out to them, and that’s why they have voted in large numbers,” reasoned Congress candidate from Bardoli Tushar Chaudhary. His colleague Kadir Pirzada, who campaigned extensively in the tribal belt for the party, seconded him.
“After the recent Supreme Court order displacing tribals from their forest lands, the Modi government took no steps (against it). This is one of the reason for tribals’ anger against Modi. Moreover, many tribal lands in south Gujarat are being acquired for the bullet train project of PM Modi. The inter-linking of Tapi and Narmada Par rivers have also affected the tribal people as their lands are being acquired. The tribal community, therefore, has shown their anger against the government by coming out in large numbers to vote,” Pirzada said.
However, BJP MP Prabhu Vasava rejected the Congress’s claims. “The large turnout of tribal voters reflects the popularity of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his several schemes. Tribal youths are attracted to him and they want him as the country’s next prime minister. So, we have come to a conclusion that it is only the PM Modi factor and no other reason behind the large tribal voter turnout,” he said.

On the ambitious Statue of Unity project, Rs 27.6 crore has been spent so far, even as the actual construction work on the 182-metre-tall statue is likely to begin after monsoon this year. Of this, Rs 23.6 crore has been spent on a consortium of global consultancy services providing company, which was hired in August 2012 to provide design, engineering, project management and construction management services for the statue.
State Finance Minister Saurabh Patel announced a fund of Rs 500 crore for the project in the 2014-15 Budget other than Rs 100 crore allocated in the 2012-13 Budget. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley offered Rs 200 crore apart from declaring it a “National Project” during the Budget presented on July 10. The project is likely to cost in the upward of Rs 3,000 crore. Recently, infrastructure major, L&T Limited, won the bid to construct and maintain the statue for Rs 2,980 crore.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust has been managing activities related to the construction of the Statue of Unity since 2011, which include hiring global consultants and overseeing creation of a website and a “high-impact audio-visual multimedia presentation in multiple languages for the project”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An Ahmedabad-based media and communication service provider, Moving Pixel Company, developed the website and create an audio-visual multimedia for the statue at a cost of Rs 16.4 lakh.
The trust started off by putting advertisements inviting proposal for providing consultancy services. The advertisements were also placed in international media including The Financial Times and The Economists, with the aim to invite bids from global consultancy firms.

Finally, a consortium comprising of three companies – Turner Project Management, Meinhardt India and Michael Graves & Associates Inc – was hired for the purpose.
A total Rs 11,383 was spent on the foundation laying ceremony for the project that was held on October 31, 2012 in Kevadia, attended by the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and senior BJP leader L K Advani. The details of expenditure incurred so far by the Trust on the Statue of Unity project was furnished by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) in response to an RTI application filed by a city-based activist, Rohit Prajapati.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The statue is coming up at Sadhu Bet, an island situated 3.2 kms downstream of Narmada dam at Kevadia. The SSNNL, in its reply to the RTI application, has maintained that no environment clearance or social impact assessment are required for the project. “Environment clearance is not required to obtain (for the project), hence environmental and social impact assessment of the project and its contribution to the cumulative impact of all the projects and activities in the area is not carried out,” it stated. However, activists have threatened to move the National Green Tribunal over environmental clearance for the project."

They had protested earlier too complaining that they were not being taken into confidence when their land was being used for building facilities for tourists for the Statue of Unity project.
Tribals from 70 villages in Vadodara’s Kevadia on Monday launched a massive protest against the Gujarat government’s proposal to establish a Statue of Unity (SoU) authority. The state government is planning to administer many parts of Kevadia that is in the vicinity of the statue through the authority.
The rally was led by sarpanches of villages that lie near the SoU. The sarpanches contend that the proposed authority would take away the rights of the villagers which is now protected under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA).
The rally held on Monday saw tribals marching and shouting slogans against the government to scrap the body immediately. The tribals asserted that they would not “give up their rights”. After the rally, the sarpanches submitted a memorandum to the collector stating that the PESA should not be diluted as it essentially empowers the village sarpanch and the tribal community to have complete ownership and rights of the land. The tribals have argued that setting up of the SoU authority will render the PESA completely useless.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

MLA Chotu Vasava, whose Bharatiya Tribal Party has been opposing the land being acquired for the project without the consent of the tribals, said, “In the name of the Statue of Unity, the government is giving away land of poor tribals to private players. This is a conspiracy to oust the tribals.”"

A 14-member BJP delegation,led by Agriculture Minister Babubhai Bokhiria,Wednesday night handed over a letter written by Modi on the upcoming “statue of unity” project to Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in Thiruvananthapuram.
“We apprised Chandy about this project. We clarified to him that there is no political motive behind building the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” Bokhiria said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Chandy showed keen interest in the project. We have also extended an invitation to him to visit Gujarat,” he said.
The 182-metre-tall “Statue of Unity” is coming up on an island on Narmada river at an estimated cost of Rs 2,074 crore. Modi had laid the foundation stone for the project in October and is garnering support from other states.
“We embark on a sincere attempt to do justice to this great visionary and his epochal contribution to the Indian nation,” Modi said in his letter to his Kerala counterpart.
“The statue will stand high not just in meters and feet but much more in terms of academic,historical,national and spiritual values…My vision is to develop the place as a source of inspiration for ages to come,” Modi said.
The delegation is in Kerala for doing the ground work for the ‘run for unity’ organised by BJP on December 15.
The ‘run for unity’,being organised across 565 districts in the country,will not only mark the death anniversary of independent India’s first home minister but also launch preparations for construction of his statue which will be tallest in world.
The delegation comprises Gujarat Tourism Corporation MD Sanjay Kaul,Gujarat Tourisam Commissioner I P Jadeja,the member of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,besides other officials and six MLAs,and is camping in Kerala since Sunday.
The delegation has met various bodies,NGOs,prominent personalities and has made presentation to them about the project.
In Kerala,the ‘run for unity’ will be held in 14 districts.
“We have decided to organise ‘run for unity’ in 14 out of 16 districts in Kerala. We have finalised venues for the 2-km run. Educational institutions in different districts have assured us of their participation in the run,” V Murlidharan,Kerala state unit BJP president,said."

The Gujarat government is gearing up to inaugurate the Statue of Unity, the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — a dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi — on October 31, the 143rd birth anniversary of the country’s first Home Minister. On Tuesday, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh visited Kevadia Colony in Narmada district to take stock of the project, which is being executed by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL).
“Having been involved in the project’s tendering process in its early stages, it is very satisfying to see the project taking shape. We are aiming for an October 31 inauguration this year, which will also mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel,” said Singh, who was the MD of SSNNL when the Statue of Unity was commissioned to it.
He told The Indian Express that he was “exhilarated” to visit the statue project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh also asserted that a ropeway, which was promised by Prime Minister Modi, would also come up in the area as an added tourist attraction.
“There is an existing ropeway that goes across the breadth of the Narmada dam, from one end to the other. So far, it has been used during the construction for transporting materials to the site. We plan to strengthen this ropeway by tendering the contract and bringing in operators, who are already providing services in other parts of the state (like Pavagadh). The ropeway will give the tourists a scenic view of the Narmada dam on one side and the impressive Statue of Unity on the other. I have travelled by that ropeway myself and I know it will be a thrill for visitors. The Prime Minister had announced the ropeway and the Chief Minister (Vijay Rupani) is keen on beginning the tendering project, although it may take some time to get the project completed,” Singh told The Indian Express.
The state government, Singh added, is also in the process of signing an MoU with the Union Ministry of Culture to secure original letters written by Sardar Patel during his life that will be placed in the museum being built close to the site of the Statue of Unity.
At present, the engineering teams working on the structure have erected 157 metres of the statue (192 metres from mean sea level), which will form the chest of the statue and will contain the viewing gallery for visitors.
P C Vyas, Chief Engineer (SSNNL), said that the work on the construction of the two concrete cores of the statue was complete. “The concrete cores A and B, which will house the elevators to take visitors to the viewing gallery, have been completed. They end at 157 metres, which is the chest of the statue. The head of the statue, which will come up above this level will be made of the steel frame that will be affixed throughout the concrete structure, too, to form the shape of the body of Sardar Patel.”
The statue is a mixture of concrete and steel framework for the core that will then be covered by the exterior cladding of bronze. The TQ Art Foundry has designed about 5,000 bronze panels under the supervision of artist Ram Sutar that have been assembled at a workshop on the site before being clad to complete the facade in stages. Vyas said, “The bronze cladding has also begun simultaneously from the feet of the statue. Currently, about three feet of bronze cladding is complete.”
The contract for the steel framework has been handed over to Malaysia-based Eversendai, which has constructed Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa — Dubai’s famous highrises.
Close to 2,400 labourers are working at the construction site day and night. The statue has been erected using the “jump form” construction assembly, a “self-climbing one”, with built-in hydraulic lifting jacks that move the structure upwards during its construction."

The proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya will be ready within three or three-and-a-half years after the construction starts, Govind Dev Giriji Maharaj, the treasurer of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust, said on Saturday.
Giriji Maharaj said financial cooperation from all devotees for constructing the temple would be accepted.
“The Akshardham Temple was built in three years, the Statue of Unity was constructed within three years, then we are also thinking that in three to three-and-a-half years, the grand temple of Lord Ram will be realised there,” Giriji Maharaj said at a press conference in Jaipur.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked whether financial cooperation from people would be accepted, he said: “With the enthusiasm with which people send bricks, now they will also donate money and Lord Ram’s temple will be built with people’s funds and public support.”
“It will also bring big donations, but we will also accept small donations because Lord Ram belongs to everyone,” Giriji Maharaj said.
According to him, the decision on when the construction would start would be taken only after time period suggested by the temple construction committee constituted under the chairmanship of Nripendra Misra.
The committee will submit its suggestions in 15 days. The next meeting of the trust is slated to be held in 15 days, during which discussion will be held to take a decision."

Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveiled Jaitley’s life-size statue, prepared by 96-year-old renowned sculptor Ram Sutar, the man behind the making of the iconic Statue of Unity in Gujarat.
Former India cricketer Bishen Singh Bedi had severely criticised the DDCA for choosing to install the statue of an administrator instead of an inspirational cricketer and even demanded that his name be removed from one the stands at the Feroze Shah Kotla ground.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
BCCI President and former India captain Sourav Ganguly, India opener Shikhar Dhawan, ex India opener Gautam Gambhir, who is also a BJP MP from Delhi, BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla and Union Minister Hardeep Puri attended the unveiling ceremony along with a number of DDCA officials.
“Arun was like an elder brother to me. He was known for his sportsmanship spirit in political circle. He remained aggressive in his speeches but never lowered the dignity of the Parliament,” Shah said in his tribute to Jaitley, who remained DDCA President for 13 years.
“Arun always put his own interest at the back, never sought publicity and rose during the Emergency days when he spent 19 months in jail. His political journey started then. He was multi-talented and fulfilled a range of responsibilities.”
Ganguly said Jaitley’s contribution was immense in the development of cricket in Delhi, though the DDCA has been in “turmoil” for some time.
“When we play and get 100, it gets recognition but lot of people work behind the scene and help the cricketers. He was a cricketer’s person. that is the role of an administrator,” he said.
“I remember a phone call (he) made during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. We had lost the first game and the whole country went berserk but he (Jaitley) said that association supports you and you play well. These small things matter, he was a great human being,” said Ganguly.
“This is a remarkably talented state which has produced so many players, Virat Kohli, Ishant Sharma, Rishabh Pant now and many in the past. A settled DDCA is good thing for Indian cricket and hopefully they can do it.”
Gambhir said the installation of Jailtely’s statue is a perfect tribute to him.
“We won the Ranji trophy during his tenure and the stadium was also built. Honesty, (being) intellectual and absolute transparency are important for any administrator and he had that,” said Gambhir.

A meeting of JD-U can be called to decide the fate of the alliance any time after June 14. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will be covering Katihar in his Seva Yatra on June 13 and 14,after which a decision is likely to be announced. Sources in the party say that parting of ways is “almost certain” as it believes that it is now only a technicality for BJP to name Modi its PM candidate,an issue on which JD-U has time and again expressed its serious reservations.
Kumar has already held the first round of consultations with party President Sharad Yadav and senior ministers of his government and the party is veering round to the view that continuing the alliance has become untenable. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“When Modi has been made campaign committee chief and the command of election has been handed over to him,will somebody else be declared the PM candidate if BJP performs well? Now declaring Modi a PM candidate of BJP is only a technical thing,” a senior leader in JD-U said. 
JD-U leaders in Patna had also given clear indications of their discomfiture with BJP after Kumar held consultations with them on the issue. “Days of JD-U’s ties with BJP are numbered” and a “big announcement” is expected “anytime” were the refrains of the leaders as the party also got in touch with the six independent MLAs in the state. JD-U has 118 MLAs in 243-member Bihar assembly and needs the support of only four more MLAs to reach the magic figure.
There are 91 MLAs from BJP,21 from RJD and one each from LJP and CPI in the state assembly. In a clear indication of things to come,senior JD-U leader Shivanand Tewari today launched a scathing attack on Modi,terming him a “divisive personality” and ridiculing his proposal to build the proposed ‘Statue of Unity’ in the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel."

The government Thursday directed district collectors and municipal commissioners across the state to ensure that all schools and colleges install replicas of the Statue of Unity, given to them during the Ekta yatras ahead of the unveiling of the statue in October, on their premises by December 15.
The directive issued, by additional chief secretary (home) Anand Mohan Tiwari, also states that local MPs and MLAs should be invited to the installation events on December 15, the day Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel died in 1950.
The BJP-ruled state government had, in October, taken out Ekta Yatras across the state ahead of the unveiling of the 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Kevadiya Colony of Narmada district. During these rallies, the government had distributed replicas of the statue to all schools and colleges.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While Tiwari could not be contacted for a comment, principal secretary Anju Sharma told The Indian Express that the objective for setting up these replicas at schools and colleges is to “inspire the future generations and inform them about the contributions and sacrifices made by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for nation-building and integrating the 562 princely states into the Indian union”.
The circular, however, added that damaged replicas should not be installed without adequate repair. The nodal officers of the Ekta Yatra have been instructed to review
the state of the replicas. The replicas that have suffered major damage will not be installed.
“There is no need to erect pedestals for installing the replicas in the educational institutions. Instead, they can be formally installed in a large hall or any other protected area with elegant protective fencing through a chain or rope,” the circular said.
The school and college administrations have been asked to hold events, involving local MPs and MLAs, along with local body representatives, to install the replicas and formally garland them on December 15.

The Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Bill, 2019, proposed to be tabled in the ongoing winter session of the Gujarat Assembly, gives sweeping powers to a Statue of Unity Tourism Authority, an authority planned to be constituted to notify a designated area around the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as an industrial township.
The authority will have powers ranging from acquiring land for any development project in the area, which is predominantly tribal, to taking punitive action against those violating it or encroaching it.
The Bill proposes to establish the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority or the SoU Tourism Authority (SoUTA). It aims to make necessary arrangements to develop the area and manage tourism in and around the Statue of Unity at Kevadia in the predominantly tribal district of Narmada in South Gujarat. Pointing out that around 30 million tourists visited the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 13 months since it was inaugurated in October 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state government feels that it needs to expedite planned development to provide “secure and safe tourism”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The authority will have representatives from various government departments, including tourism, forests and environment, roads and building, urban development and the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), besides president of the Narmada district panchayat (a politically elected appointee). It will be headed by a chairman appointed by the state government and will be headquartered at Kevadia in Narmada district.
The authority will define the limits of the tourism development area and will be empowered to acquire immovable property under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. It will largely work as a local body that will prepare and execute a development plan or a town planning scheme, remove encroachments and provide civic amenities like water supply, transportation, power supply, drainage, hospitals, medical services, schools, public parks, markets, shopping places, disposal of waste, among others. The bill sets aside Rs 10 crore from the consolidated fund of the state for the discharge of functions and duties by SoUTA.
To protect the tourism area and to maintain it, the district police has been asked to assist the officers of the authority to enforce the provisions of the Bill, which is expected to be tabled in the Gujarat Assembly on Tuesday. The Authority, either on its own or acting on a complaint can prohibit “any nuisance being caused or prevent any such activity, process, operation being carried out,” if it opines that it will damage or deteriorate the “tourism potentiality” of the area.
“Expenses and costs incurred, if any, in removing or abating such nuisance, shall be recovered as an arrear of land revenue from the person who has caused such nuisance,” it says. Persons who fails to comply with directions given by the authority shall be punishable with imprisonment for up to a month or with a fine up to Rs 50,000 or both. The offence will also be treated as “cognisable and non-bailable”.
The punitive action in the Bill comes at time when local tribal organisations have been opposing the project built near the Sardar Sarovar dam, alleging they have lost their livelihood and land. The project drew opposition even on the day PM Modi arrived to inaugurate the project in 2018.
Persons authorised by the authority can enter any land or building between sunrise and sunset by giving its occupant a notice of at least 24 hours. Persons obstructing entry of authorised personnel will face punitive action, it says. The proposed Bill also prevents persons from begging, unauthorised hawking or engage in touting within the Tourism Development Area. Those violating the provisions may face imprisonment of up to one month or a fine of Rs 5,000 or both. Those acting as tourist guides without having a licence on conviction can be imprisonment for up to a month.
The Bill also shields the proposed authority and its members. It states that “no suit, prosecution, or other legal proceedings shall lie against the SoU Tourism Authority, other government companies, or any of their committees, members, officers and employees for anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of the provisions of this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder”. The proposed authority will also be empowered to create a “SoU Authority Fund” which will shall form of all money received by way of grants, loans, fees, development charges, etc."

The state government has proposed to build an airport at Rajpipla, an erstwhile princely state in Narmada district, to provide air connectivity for tourists visiting the Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in the district.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani held consultations with the chairman of Airport Authority of India (AAI) Guruprasad Mahapatra a few weeks ago regarding the proposal.

In the time of lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19, zoos across the state are making sure that the carnivores do not go without their daily dose of meat.
While the Vadodara, Rajkot and Junagadh zoos have been able to procure buffalo meat for its carnivores in advance, Surat Municipal Corporation’s Sarthana zoo has resorted to feeding smaller meals of chicken to its big cats.
With the supply of buffalo meat disrupted due to the lockdown, Surat zoo authorities are feeding about 30 kilos of chicken per day to three tigers, five jackals, five leopards, and four hyenas. The authorities said that the onset of summer naturally reduces the diet of the carnivores, but due to the lockdown buffalo meat has not reached the zoo which procures its supply through local contractors. Fish, however, has been available for White Ibis, Otter, Pelican, Night Heron, Spoonbill and Stock. The zoo is feeding about 35 kilos of fish to its birds on a daily basis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sarthana Zoo superintendent Dr Praful Mehta said, “The supply chain of buffalo meat has been hampered due to the lockdown, so we are replacing it with chicken. Our zoo does not have facility of slaughtering live animals but now we are considering setting up one in the near future. We are getting fish from contractors in Dumas, Navsari and other places.”
In Vadodara’s Sayajibaug Zoo, the supply of buffalo meat has been aplenty, such that it is also supplying 60 kilograms to the Kevadia Zoological Park near the Statue of Unity in Narmada district, about 90 kilometres away.
The Vadodara zoo authorities said that a plan was chalked out in advance, much before the announcement of the lockdown, keeping in mind the looming crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Curator Pratyush Patankar said, “We issued passes to our meat suppliers and transport persons with my contact number printed on it so that the police at check posts could confirm and allow the vehicle to pass during lockdown. We had anticipated this situation and so we had already made sure that our supplier has stock to give us. For our pair of tigers, pair of lions and six leopards along with a pair of jackals and a few carnivorous birds in Vadodara, we need about 70 kg of buffalo meat per day. We have an in-house slaughterhouse… we need about three buffaloes per day. This includes the 60 kg of fresh meat that we are supplying to Kevadia zoological park since the beginning of the lockdown.”
Patankar said that while the zoo hasn’t faced any hurdle in procuring meat, the lockdown has meant that the person designated to find animals for slaughter must travel village to village in search of sellers. “In regular times, we purchase the buffaloes from weekly animal haats in tribal areas. But now that the haats are shut due to the lockdown, our supplier has activated his network to purchase from individual farmers in Padra and Karjan in Vadodara district as well as from outside like Panchmahal. In the beginning of the lockdown, our supplier had stock for 12 days for our zoo,” Patankar said.
Everyday, the bovines are slaughtered inside the Vadodara zoo and 60 kg is packed in thermocol boxes and transported to Kevadia Colony. Patankar said the Kevadia Zoological Park has arranged its vehicle to ferry the fresh meat and also agreed to observe fasting day on Thursday.
“At Sayajibaug zoo, we have a practice of keeping the carnivores on fast on Thursdays. This is in line with the natural course of wild animals. They do not get feed everyday when they are on their own in the wild and hunting,” Patankar added.
Kevadia Zoological Park Director Ram Ratan Nala said that while the supply of meat for the carnivores in the safari park has been taken care of by the Sayajibaug zoo, the alternate contingency plan includes procuring chickens from local farmers in Narmada district.
“Since zoo management and wildlife management has been kept under essential services by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), so far, we haven’t faced any trouble getting the meat. We have six big carnivores – two tigers, two lions and two leopards. We also have smaller carnivores. The big carnivores need about 8 to 10 kg of feed per day while the smaller ones need up to a kilo. If there is any issue in the future during the pandemic, we will buy chicken from local farmers. We also have to check the quality of the meat before feeding the animals,” Nala said.
Rajkot Zoological Park, popularly called Pradyuman Park, said it has also issued identity cards to those who supply meat, fodder and other feed for animals and birds.
“The Central Zoo Authority had issued instructions to all zoos and mini-zoos in the country to ensure enough supply of food, feed and fodder for captive animals during lockdown. The government has exempted suppliers of food, feed and fodder to zoos and their vehicles from the lockdown. Therefore, soon after the lockdown came into force, we issued identity cards to all our suppliers and there hasn’t been any difficulty in regular supply of these things,” Rakesh Hirapara, director of Pradyuman Park, said.
The zoo has 17 Asiatic lions, nine white tigers, one royal Bengal tiger and around 10 other smaller carnivores. Hirapara said that the present supplier functions out of a slaughter house controlled by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation in Sadar area of the city. The Sakkarbaug Zoo run by the Gujarat state forest department said that supply for its captive animals has not been disturbed so far but it has done stockpiling commercial broiler to meet any exigencies.
“We have around 120 carnivores, including 65 Asiatic lions, 45 leopards and smaller carnivores like wolves, caracals, foxes etc and we have an in-house slaughter house. Daily, we need average six livestock heads at the slaughter house to feed these carnivores. The supply of the livestock has not been affected so far as district administration has issued certificates to our suppliers…,” Abhishek Kumar, director of Sakkarbaug Zoo, said."

The tender bids for construction and maintenance of the Statue of Unity were opened Wednesday, with engineering giant L&T all set to bag the contract at the lowest bid of Rs 2,980 crore against an estimated cost of Rs 2,063 crore.
J N Singh, MD of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) — the implementing agency for the 182-metre tall statue, said declaring construction of the massive iron statue as a national project will definitely work for it. “It will get national attention. And we stay assured that the central government is also there for us. Also, you stay assured that if there is any hurdle it will be resolved.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Singh said that the commitment of the Centre to grant Rs 200 crore for the project is encouraging.  The Gujarat government has already sanctioned Rs 500 crore for the Statue of Unity.
The Indian Express had run a report last month on how the iron collection drive for the statue did not yield desired result with as many as 16 states not contributing anything for the project.
Sources said that the government had invited tenders for the design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance of the Statue of Unity from companies across the world. However, only two groups filled the tenders — L&T and a consortium of companies. Sources said that L&T had filed bid of Rs 2,980 crore for the project that included operation and maintenance for 15 years. Whereas, the consortium had bid for Rs 4,100 crore.
The tender procedure was done by a consultant firm appointed by the SSNNL and now the latter plans to issue a Letter of Intent (LoI) to L&T for initiating the project after necessary negotiations. Sources said that L&T is expected to start work on the project after monsoon."

The occasion was the inauguration of a renovated memorial for Patel and Modi was invited as a guest in his capacity as chief minister on a turf controlled largely by the Congress.
But Modi spared no attempt to make his point.
Is desh ko hamesha ek gila-shikva rahega,ek dard rahega. Har Hindustani ke dil me ek dard rahega. Kaash Sardar saab hamare pehle pradhan mantri hote,toh aaj desh ki taqdeer bhi alag hoti,desh ki tasveer bhi alag hoti (This country will always have one regret. Every Indian will have this pain in his heart. Had Sardar Patel been our first Prime Minister,then the face and the destiny of the country would have been different), he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also said Patel is an inspiration to fight Maoism and terrorism and to bring youth who have gone astray back into the mainstream. Modi,who will lay the foundation of the 182m Statue of Unity two days later at the Sardar Sarovar dam site on the Narmada river,on the birth anniversary of Patel,has been claiming that the Congress has failed to give Patel his due.
The Congress,on the other hand,has been criticising the Modi government saying it had not given any funds for the memorial. The Centre has given Rs 17 crore and  Union Mines Minister Dinsha Patel is the president of the memorial.
In his speech,Singh called Patel secular and named Mahatma Gandhi,Jawaharlal Nehru,Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as some leaders who did India proud.
Singh said that while Nehru and Patel had differences,their points of agreement were far larger in number. He quoted Patel as having said that,It has been my good fortune to be advising Nehru on the issues nagging administration and organisation.
Faith in Indias unity,a secular and broad vision,feelings for the poor and weak,tolerance and respect for those who are ideologically different from us – I feel that today the people present here would agree that these are some values which are lacking in our country today. Which makes it necessary for us to pause at intervals and recall the grand ideals on which our country was founded, said Singh.
The PM also said he was proud to belong to the Congress of which Patel had been a leader.
Earlier,Modi was seen attempting to make conversation with a relatively cold Singh who was seated on his right. 
Modi arrived at the venue on time at 5 pm and took a tour of the museum with Union Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel.
Singh arrived at 5.25 pm and joined him at the museum. Referring to the late arrival of the PM,Modi said: There is a shortage of time. It was necessary for the honourable Prime Minister to go to Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan before coming to the Sardar Patel Smarak. 
Modi was visibly angry when Dinsha Patel corrected a detail in his speech where he had referred to Sardar Patels passing a resolution in the Ahmedabad Municipality on womens reservation in 1919. I would like to correct the chief minister that while what he said about the resolution is correct,it was not in 1919 but in 1926, Dinsha Patel said.
The crowd,mostly comprising Congress workers,which had applauded when Modi had said the Central government under Singh had conferred more than 90 awards on Gujarat for good governance,screamed Feku,Feku when Dinsha Patel made the correction."

Abdul Sheikh, an auto rickshaw driver and a resident of Jetpur Vaghrali village in Narmada district, has taken time off from his work to drive his daughter and four of her classmates to the SSC exam centre in Boriya village, across the Narmada River from Kevadia colony. The Gujarat state board exams for Class 10 began Thursday.
However, with the Gora bridge demolished and the new one under construction, a usual 15-kilometre ride has now become exactly double. The new bridge is closed for traffic, cutting off the only quick access to villages on either side of the Narmada river. Nearly 70 students from four villages who have their exam centres in schools across the Narmada river, have had to find alternate routes because of absence of the bridge.
As a makeshift emergency access for light two-wheelers and construction use, a pathway of loose mud, gravel and stones has been kept open under the watch of the State Reserve Forces (SRP) deployed to ensure that no one ventures on to the under construction bridge.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


	ExplainedWhat is the Garudeshwar weir?

On Thursday morning, the makeshift pathway remained busy as parents from either sides took their children to their respective examination centres even as SRP personnel guarded both ends of the new incomplete bridge to prevent vehicular movement. The personnel diverted all four-wheelers, including cars, buses, trucks, vans a kilometer away from the bridge to prevent chaos at the ends.
“The distance is almost 15 km more now than what it otherwise takes from our village to here (Boriya) via the Gora bridge. I decided to take the longer route via Bhanadra crossroad because I did not find the temporary road on the river safe. It is not even a proper road and it is underneath a bridge which is yet to be fully functional,” Sheikh said.

Pintulal English Medium School in Boriya, which is located across the river from Kevadia colony, is an exam centre for students from at least four villages from the side of the bridge including Navagam, Jetpur Vaghrali, Bhumaliya and Makedamba.
Earlier this week, authorities began demolishing the old Gora bridge connecting the two sides from the centre. The reason for the rushed demolition, sources in the administration said, was also to ensure that the river channel downstream is clear for the jetty service at the Statue of Unity which is supposed to begin by mid-March. Officials also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the service.
The Gora bridge, which local residents say was at least three decades old, was also low in height and often went under water during heavy monsoon when the dam released water. In August last year, the villages on the either side were cut off because of this.
The new bridge, built at a desirable height will also allow the authorities to keep water in the downstream until the newly constructed Garudeshwar Weir, which will be used to reverse pump the water released after generation of power from the six turbines of the Riverbed Powerhouse of the dam.
It is here that the jetty will also give the tourists a panoramic view of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam and the Statue of Unity.
However, parents of students appearing for exams question the timing of the demolition. Jaisinh Bhai Tadvi (52), a resident of Bhumaliya village, who drove his son Pratosh and his friend on a two-wheeler through the makeshift pathway to reach their centre in Boriya, said, “Before demolishing the old bridge, they should have first finished the new bridge and opened it for the public. It is very inconvenient for the residents. This temporary road is very dangerous. It is narrow and the movement is from either side. Also it is just sand, gravel and rocks, and water on either side and the entire path is undulated. And the concrete route is way too long.”
When asked if they would take the soil and gravel short cut everyday, Pratosh said, “Not again. We will leave early and take the longer route. It’s better to reach safe.”
Another SSC student Priti Tadvi from Navagam was also accompanied by two of her sisters to the exam centre for safety reasons. “I would have come alone to the exam centre, but since we had to take this temporary route, my sisters came along with me just to make sure that I reach safe.”
Narmada District Education Officer Nipa Patel told this newspaper that the department had contacted the four exam centres to ask them if they would face any difficulty if the bridge was demolished. “I had a word with the authorities of the four examination centres on either side as well as the schools and the principals. They told me that they are fine with the decision to demolish the bridge. No one had complained of any difficulty in travelling to the exam centres. The principals told us that they will make arrangements for all students of their schools, “ Patel said.
The new bridge has been constructed in a way that it allows the jetty to pass through the space between its pillars. An SSNNL engineer said, “The old Gora bridge, which had been situated 6 km downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam, with total length of 740 metres and width 7.9 metres, had 59 piers and height of bottom deck of bridge is 29 metres. As its height was low, it used to go under water during high flood in river. The jetty service has been planned in a way that it operates six kilometres from the SOU, which means that it will pass under the deck of the new bridge. So, we had to build a new bridge.”
While Narmada district collector M Kothari was unavailable for comment, SSNNL MD Rajiv Gupta said the work on the new bridge was “almost complete and it would open shortly” but did not commit a time frame. Gupta also said he was “not aware” about the dates finalised for the inauguration of the jetty service."

Addressing an election gathering in Visnagar of Mehsana district, on Monday, Paatil referred to Modi’s roots in the region and said that when it comes to give benefits, Modi has never forgotten Gujarat and certainly not North Gujarat.
“It is my humble request to all of you. There should not be any mistake. There should not be any laziness. Erase any like or dislike (for any party candidate). Whether you like a candidate or not, consider Narendra Modi. Votes have to be given by considering him (Modi),” Paatil said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

He then added, “I am assuring you, we will not spare a candidate if he/she makes any mistake after getting elected. We will not give him/her a chance to make a mistake. We will not pardon his/her mistake.”
Visnagar is a town in Mehsana district, considered a BJP bastion, from where the 2015 Patidar reservation agitation came into limelight. In July 2015, a rally led by leaders of the agitation, including Hardik Patel, had turned violent in which the office of the local BJP MLA Rushikesh Patel’s office was torched.
The agitation damaged BJP’s core vote bank, Patidar community, so much that the party could not win either Mehsana district panchayat or Mehsana municipality in 2015. In another reference to Modi — a native of Vadnagar in Mehsana, Paatil said, “Modi Saheb has not forgotten Gujarat. And he has certainly not forgotten North Gujarat.”
Paatil said that the people of North Gujarat were fortunate to have leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel. Paatil also said that in the ticket distribution for Surat Municipal Corporation, BJP has given seven persons having roots in North Gujarat — four Patidars and one each from Rabari, Ahir and Bharwad communities.

Referring to the representation given to North Gujarat in party organization, Paatil said that a senior bureaucrat Mahendra Patel, from Unjha, has been made vice-president in the party. Mahendra, a former IAS officer, was a collector of Surat district.
Paatil said, “I told him (Mahendra) that I am making a team of organisation and I need people like you who are eager to do something for the people. He (Mahendra) told me that he would resign immediately. And after resigning, he joined BJP as a worker… We have given him the responsibility in the party as vice president.”

The latest episode of Discovery’s popular series Man vs Wild, hosted by Bear Grylls, presented an altogether unseen facet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vivid personality. The nonchalant manner in which PM Modi enjoyed his adventurous trip sans any security cover, that too deep inside the world-famous Jim Corbett National Park, left millions of viewers of this superhit series in India — and across the world — spellbound.
But people who have had a personal acquaintance with Modi know well that the adventure show was not a regular television programme — some deep thought process must have gone behind its conceptualisation. Whatever Modi does is not without a purpose: His real plans behind this mega show will be revealed in the months to come. But one thing is obvious: When Modi decided to appear with Grylls, the idea must have been much beyond sharing his personal experiences and his brush with Mother Nature.
The timing of the show is itself significant, as the entire world today is trying to find a way to stop global warming, and save the earth’s species from extinction. And we have seen how our prime minister has led the world from the front in this realm during the Paris climate change summit in 2015.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Through Grylls’ show, he once again tried to underline how Indians are intertwined with nature, and are deeply in love with Mother Earth. He explained to the world the Indian philosophy of “vasudhaiva kutumbakam” (the world is one family); and, how we believe in “sarve bhavantu sukhinah, sarve santu niraamayaah, sarve bhadraanni pashyantu, maa kashchit dukhha bhagbhavet” (May all become happy, may all be free from illness/ May all see what is auspicious, may no one suffer). We all pray to Mother Nature.
Let’s not forget that when the Lok Sabha polls were coming to an end, PM Modi’s visit to Kedarnath, a place which is very close to his heart and which he has never missed a chance to visit year after year, was much talked about. When the holy shrine bore the brunt of devastating floods in 2013, he was shaken to the core. Since then he has made every effort to ensure that Kedarnath’s glory is restored. Today, the entire Kedarnath valley, particularly the shrine, has virtually risen from the ashes due to the determined efforts of Modi.
The regular visits Modi has made have not only speeded up the restoration and rebuilding of Kedarnath, but have also restored the faith of the masses. Gradually, the entire shrine complex has regained its grandeur under the guidance of the prime minister. This has also led to an influx of visitors to Kedarnath and other old shrines in Uttarakhand. This year a record 11 lakh visitors are likely to pay their obeisance at Kedarnath before the holy shrine closes for winter. This number — it used to be around seven lakh in earlier years — has seen a remarkable increase. Faith has prevailed against all odds.
One interesting aspect related to Modi’s visit to Kedarnath is about his stay at a stone cave where he meditated. Today, I am flooded with queries from across India, and also abroad, from people showing keen desire to stay in the “Modi cave” — the name it has got after the prime minister’s stay — for meditation. And all this is due to Modi’s charisma.
A similar effect is likely to be witnessed in Jim Corbett after the airing of the Man vs Wild episode. The transformation of Uttarakhand from the land of religious tourism into a haven for adventure and nature tourism is inevitable. Uttarakhand will soon become the most sought-after destination for adventure and wildlife. We will see, in the months to come, Jim Corbett National Park taking a big leap in the tourism sector in India and abroad.
Modi has a unique way of making things work. One of the shining examples of it is the world’s tallest statue, “Statue of Unity”, dedicated to the “Iron Man of India”, Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which has come up at a remote location in Gujarat. Now, every month, lakhs of visitors are travelling to this place which has led to a complete transformation of the region: This has given a fillip to the local economy and created new avenues for jobs.
It is with this extraordinary vision that Modi works towards the development of society. So, when he set a target of developing all-weather roads in the difficult terrains of the Uttarakhand Himalayas in record time, and decided to invest Rs10,000 crore to construct 570 km of roads under the Bharatmala project connecting bordering and remote areas of Uttarakhand to the national mainstream, his vision to ensure speedy development of Uttarakhand was crystal clear. Today, the Uttarakhand hills are being connected through the rail network also.
Since I belong to Uttarakhand, I have been witness to the transformation that the state is undergoing under the direct supervision of Modi: You have to visit the state to experience these changes. For Uttarakhand and its people, Modi is a true “vikas purush”, a “karamyogi”. I firmly believe that what is true for Uttarakhand is true for the rest of the country. Since 2014, India has been undergoing social and economic transformation. Time and again Modi has broken myths, walked on the path his predecessors shunned, and taken decisions which were considered impossible. India, and the world, are fast realising the mettle Modi is made of.

W HILE green nod for the Rs 1,900 crore mid-Arabian sea Shivaji statue project finally came from the Centre last week, the Maharashtra government, which has twice failed to elicit any response from project management consultants (PMC), will now take a leaf out of neighbouring Gujarat that is constructing the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue on a river island.
Earlier this year, under the previous Congress-NCP government, the equestrian statue of the Maratha warrior king was redesigned with an increased height of 190 metres to tower over Gujarat’s under-construction Statue of Unity, which at 182 metres was touted as the world’s tallest.
State government officials have now sourced tender documents from the Gandhinagar-based special purpose vehicle that is executing the Statue of Unity project. “We will contact all seven firms that had shown interest in the Patel statue project, including the four that finally submitted their bids,” said R C Joshi, chief engineer of Maharashtra’s Public Works Department (PWD). PWD officials added that they would, on priority basis, get in touch with Turner constructions, which was finally appointed as the PMC for the Patel statue project and have also been consultants for Dubai’s tallest tower Burj Khalifa.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Since May this year, the department has issued bids for appointing a PMC twice. Both times, the sole bidder was the Indo-French STUP Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. This time around, PWD officials say, they have tweaked their tender documents so as to include certain conditions similar to the Gujarat project.
“In order to reassure prospective PMCs in case of procedural delays, the tender documents for the Patel statue had a condition stating that they would be paid an additional amount equal to 7.5 per cent of the lump-sum fee quoted by them per year of delay. We have now inserted the same clause whereby the appointed PMC for the Shivaji memorial will be paid similarly in case the project is not completed within its stipulated five-year period,” said a PWD official.
He added that once the final draft of the tender documents is approved by the state government, the department would call for global bids for a third time.
The earlier design of the statue, approved by the Ashok Chavan government, was 98-metre high aimed at dwarfing the 93-m high Statue of Liberty in Manhattan. The PMC will now have to work on the revised conceptual plans for the 190-m high statue as chalked out by JJ College of Architecture principal Rajiv Mishra. “The PMC will be an international consortium of architect, structural engineer, landscape designer, marine engineer, developer among others. From fleshing out the conceptual plan submitted by us to constructing the actual memorial, the PMC will be entirely responsible for the project,” said Mishra.Mumbai NewsMumbai: Man, kin get anticipatory bail in domestic violence caseMedical professional can’t be prosecuted without ‘gross’ negligence: Bombay HCMumbai: Campaigning for Pandharpur-Mangalweda bypoll concludesClick here for more

(Source: Express Photo)
The first anniversary celebrations of the Statue of Unity on October 31 was expected to be a grand affair with Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurating as many as 30 tourist attractions at the site. However, top Gujarat government officials said Modi may skip the celebrations, as an unavoidable foreign trip has come up around the same time. Modi is therefore likely to visit Kevadia colony earlier, in the last week of September, a top source said. He will be attending an event of the Ministry of Power that will be held there. A bullet proof tent in the tent city of Kevadia colony is being readied for Modi’s visit after SPG raised concerns over putting up the PM in a cloth tent there.

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was rubbed the wrong way during a press conference in Gandhinagar on Tuesday where he announced the implementation of the new penalties under the Motor Vehicles Act. As Rupani was dictating the new speed limits introduced by the Transport Department on various types of roads, one of the journalists asked him about a recent video where Bharatiya Janata Party state president Jitu Vaghani is seen driving a jeep through Gir Forest without a seat belt, Rupani appeared miffed and replied, “Be it Jitu Vaghani, myself or anyone, traffic laws will be followed by all, no matter if they are businessmen, politicians or even journalists.”"

“You all know that in Godhra, no development works have been carried out in areas that have Muslim majority. There is a railway line passing through the city. On one side of this railway line, ‘Sabka ka Saath, sabka Vikas’ can be seen. On the other side, where topi and burkas can be seen, there is no Vikas (development),” said Owaisi in Godhra town.
“What is the reason that trains like Garib Rath and August Kranti do not stop at Godhra railway station? These trains stop at Dahod though. If Godhra had a large Muslim population, then doesn’t it also have Hindus brothers? The BJP government wants Dahod to develop… what kind of justice is this,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said there were 20 secondary schools in Godhra city of which, only three were in Muslim areas. He said the dropout rate among school going Muslim girls were as high as 80 per cent due to lack of Urdu medium schools. “Modiji then says, Beti Bachao, Desh Bachao. How will daughters be saved, if there are no urdu schools for them…,” he added.
On Tuesday, AlMIM won about seven seats in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), winning all seats in Jamalpur ward and three seats in Maktampura ward. The party had fielded 21 candidates for the AMC. Thanking the voters, Owaisi said, “If people sitting in power in AMC think that they will continue to ignore Muslim areas like they did in the past, then I would like to tell that that so far you were engaged in a friendly duel with Congress or independents. Now now we will fight (for development).”
In the upcoming elections, BJP is contesting in 24 of the 44 seats in Godhra municipality. Traditionally, BJP has been putting up candidates in only six wards of the municipality where Hindus are in a majority. On the other five wards, Muslim candidates have been winning largely as independents.
In the 2015 local body polls in Godhra municipality, BJP won 18 seats, Congress won one seat and remaining 25 seats were won by independents. Eight candidates of AIMIM will fight the Godhra municipality polls on February 28. The party has fielded candidates in Godhra, Modasa and Bharuch municipalities.
Earlier in the day in Modasa, Owaisi invoked the 2008 bomb blast case that claimed one life and said that people “reply to the oppressors” in the upcoming elections. The AIMIM has fielded 12 candidates in three wards of Modasa municipality.

“Do you know what happened on September 29, 2008 in Modasa,” Owaisi asked as crowd responded saying “bomb blast”. “Among the deceased was a 15-year-old boy named Jamal Ab Din Ghouri… a blast occurred near a mosque during Ramzan month in Modasa in which seven were martyred and over 100 were injured (referring to both Malegon and Modasa blasts cases ). I want to ask the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gujarat Chief Minister and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh people… I want to ask the cowards of Congress whether they will ever speak of Jamal,” asked Owaisi claiming, till date the people responsible for the blast were not brought to book.
“The families of the deceased persons in the blast still don’t know who killed their loved ones. I appeal to my mothers and sisters that we will not let another Jamal to die in Modasa… Human life has a value be it a Hindu, Muslim or tribal… it has been granted to us in the Constitution by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar,” said Owaisi.
Referring to the protests in Modasa in January 2020 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), Owaisi said, “I want to congratulate the people of Modasa for the manner in which they protested against the CAA, NRC and NPR… I spoke up in the Parliament against 306 MPs of the BJP saying that if they will bring the CAA, then we will protest. We, too, have the right to live without fear (sic).”
Attacking the Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party president Arvind Kejriwal in his 30-minute address, Owaisi said, “There is a guy who has come to Gujarat with a bundle of brooms… when riots were taking place in Delhi, when Hindus and Muslims were killing each other, he went to Gandhi samadhi and sat over there… This guy kept quiet even when the Tablighi Jamat was given a bad name and accused of waging corona Jihad in Delhi.”
Alleging that the Congress has not given the post of mayor to a Muslim in Modasa, fearing that it would upset their votebank, he said, “It is the Congress party that is responsible for India’s Muslims being weak, India’s Muslims lacking a political voice and India’s Muslims, Dalits and Advasis getting harassed. Modiji has spent so much money in constructing the Statue of Unity but in the process he also displaced over 75,000 tribal people from there(sic).”

The Statue of Unity is a 182-metre high statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to be built on an island on Narmada river at the cost of Rs 2,074 crore. 
The Run for Unity is being organised by Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust  formed under chairmanship of Modi. Sources said that members of the Trust,led by Gujarat ministers,are expected to meet UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and address the press at various places. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The state BJP leaders claimed that no officer from Gujarat has contacted them so far for any help regarding the event. 
A senior official of Gujarat government,however,said 12 officers,including Vadodara range DIG Anupam Singh Gahlot,Inspector General of Police (IGP) Manoj Agrawal,IGP Anil Pratham,Additional Principal Conservator of Forests H S Singh and Deputy Secretary in Gujarats finance department Rajendra Joshi,have already toured UP to oversee the preparations for the Run for Unity.
Talking to The Indian Express over phone,DIG Gahlot said,From Friday onwards,I toured three districts including Agra,Aligarh and Bareilly and visited some schools to meet teachers and appeal them to coordinate other institutions for Run for Unity.
A Chartered Accountant in Agra told The Indian Express,I was told that an officer from Gujarat wants to meet me. I was asked to reach a marriage lawn where 25 other people were already present. There IPS officer Gahlot asked us to mobilise the masses to take part in the event.
Sources added that Additional Principal Conservator of Forests H S Singh visited Mirzapur recently. Deputy Secretary Rajendra Joshi visited Lucknow to seek appointment from UP Governor B L Joshi for a meeting with Gujarat minister Nitin Patel who is in-charge of Statue of Unity project in UP.    
Vadodara municipal commissioner Manish Bhardwaj,who belongs to Varanasi district of UP,has been made head of the team of officers visiting the home state. 
Officers have finalised the venues for the 2-km run in different districts. They also visited the educational institutions that will take part in the run, Bhardwaj told The Indian Express. 
He said that officers engaged to oversee work are of Gujarat cadre but to UP. 
The UP BJP has already formed district level units for collection of iron for the Statue of Unity.  
Sources said nearly 200 officers from Gujarat have been sent to their home states with the same objective. 
What is Run for Unity 
A 2-km run to be organised at 565 places across the country on December 15,to mark Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels death anniversary. Gujarat government is expecting participation of at least 5,000 people at every place where the run is held to garner support for Statue of Unity."

The world’s tallest statue, the ‘Statue of Unity’, may have made headlines globally, but one group of people were quite miffed. Tamilians were upset – not with the statue – but a signboard that reportedly featured the name of the statue in several languages. They claimed the Tamil translation of ‘Statue of Unity’ was just ‘gibberish’. The signboard was not to be found during the inauguration on Wednesday.
However, a top official from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam said that the picture of the signboard featuring the Tamil text was fake. They said no such signage was present at the site or had been pulled down.
“The viral image of the erroneous Tamil translation of the Statue of Unity is a mischievous attempt by someone to tarnish the event that is a grand tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The actual signboard is that of the statue with its logo, stating that is a government of India project,” the official said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Neither was there a plan earlier nor will it be in the near future to have signboards in foreign languages as indicated in the pictures. We are not expecting foreign tourists, especially from Russia and Europe. If at all such signboard, it would be in all Indian languages to signify unity of India,” the official said.
On Twitter, however, many criticised the alleged signboard:

The tamil translation of the word ‘Statue of Unity’ had been done badly. It should be corrected in the board kept at the site of the status as, ‘ஒற்றுமை சிலை’ or ‘ஒருமைப்பாடு சிலை’. Will PM take note of it and get it corrected?

The 182-metre high statue was inaugurated Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The article has been updated to include the statement by officials on the image that was shared widely on social media."
"1618504838-978","https://indianexpress.com/page/36/?s=%22Statue+of+unity%22","Modi plays defensive on home turf,on  a spree to please everyone in the state","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/modi-plays-defensive-on-home-turf-on-a-spree-to-please-everyone-in-the-state/","Modi plays defensive on home turf,on  a spree to please everyone in the state","November 7, 2013 4:47:50 am","His nomination as BJPs prime ministerial candidate seems to have turned Chief Minister Narendra Modi into an unusually defensive player on home turf. The past few months have seen Modi play to the gallery,trying to keep politically important sections  farmers,tribals,party cadres and even NGOs  in good humour by accepting their long-pending demands.
To begin with,he silenced a menacing agitation against the  Mandal-Becahraji (MB) Special Investment Region (SIR),which also covered the Maruti Suzuki plant,by announcing the scrapping of 80 per cent of the SIR. This was followed by the announcement of a new taluka  Garudeshwar  in the tribal area of central Gujarat to quieten the agitation by locals against the acquisition of their land under the Kevadia Area Development Authority  for the Statue of Unity project. For the first time in his 12-year tenure,appointments in public corporations and boards were made this year.
Modi has also gone for a ministry expansion after dilly-dallying for almost a year. Old loyals like Vijay Rupani and former deputy chief minister Narhari Amin,who had left Congress to join hands with Modi just before the 2012 Assembly elections,have been rewarded. No such appointment has been made since 2001. Another import from Congress,Saurashtra strongman Vitthal Radadiya,who was showing signs of unrest following delay in the ministry expansion,was finally rewarded. Radadiyas son,Jayesh,was included in the ministry on November 1.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modis detractors,however,say that this is a part of his political strategy to buy time and show a picture of a happy Gujarat to the nation. It was Modi government only which,from 2009 to 2011,fought a legal battle against farmers,going to the SC to save the land allotted to Nirma Cement plant in coastal Mahuva of Bhavnagar district. The agitation was led by the then BJP MLA Dr Kanubhai Kalsariya. The Modi government was very adamant. It was not willing to compromise at all, said Dr Kalsaria,who had led farmers agitation against Nirma Cement plant despite being a BJP MLA then. But this time,when Modi has national aspirations,his government is on the back foot, he added. 
In August,two months after Modi was made the BJPs PM nominee,Modi,however,gave in to pressure from farmers by withdrawing 36 of the 44 villages under the M-B SIR,sparing the Maruti Suzuki automobile factory,the flagship project on the SIR. Dr Kalsariya was also part of this agitation. And this happened despite the fact that this SIR was important,given its proximity to the  Delhi-Mumbai Freight Corridor. Farmers from SIR-affected villages put up an intense show by landing in Gandhinagar in huge numbers. In Kevadiya,tribals from 70 villages downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam,met the cabinet core committee in Gandhinagar on October 15 and registered a protest against the Statue of Unity project. 
On October 31,while laying the foundation stone of the Statue of Unity,Modi said,Narmada is a small district. And,for its development,weve accepted peoples demands and declared Garudeshwar a new taluka. Besides,the villages on the left side of the dam will also get Narmada water. The state government had created 23 new talukas on August 15,but the demand for Garudeshwar had been  rejected. 
Sanat Mehta,former Gujarat finance minister who was also a part of Mahuva and SIR agitation,said,This is Modis political strategy. To sell his development model,Modi wants to show to the nation that there is no discontent against him in Gujarat. He has provided political solutions and not addressed root cause.  Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Trupti Shah,who was part of the agitation by 70 villages,said,For the first time in many years,the Modi government talked to us. But this is just a trick. We need to see whether the decisions that have been announced will be implemented and what happens after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections."

(PTI photo)
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and his Deputy Nitin Patel on Saturday reviewed the progress of work of Statue of Unity (SoU) here on Sadhu Bet as the state government is planning to complete it by October 31 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to inaugurate the same on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The two leaders were also joined by top state government officers like Chief Secretary J N Singh, Chief Principal Secretary to the CM K Kailashnathan and Chairman & Managing Director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) S S Rathore.
SoU is a project conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. The project is about erecting a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as a tribute to the man who played a pivotal role in getting India united by merging a number of princely states into the county.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Engineering giant Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) has got the tender of design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance of the statue at a cost of around Rs 2,980 crore.
During his visit to the under-construction site, Rupani interacted not only with the officers of SSNNL, but also with the labourers. He also gave suggestions to the SSNNL officers.
Later, the chief minister held a meeting with the top officers at Circuit House.
“In the meeting, it was informed that the steel structure of the statue will be completed by September 20 and the bronze work of it will be completed by October 10,” said an official release.
Rupani was quoted as saying by the release that the facilities at SoU like food court, cafeteria will be world-class in terms of safety and cleanliness. A Bharat Bhavan with capacity of 52 rooms will also be built near the statue. He also added that a total 1.40 lakh metric tonne concrete, 18,500 metric tonne steel, 70,000 metric tonne cement and 2,000 metric tonne bronze will be used in the construction of the statue having a surface area of 2,000 square metre. Three thousand labourers and 300 engineers are currently working on the project.

The statue is a mixture of concrete and steel framework for the core that will then be covered by the exterior cladding of bronze. The TQ Art Foundry has designed about 5,000 bronze panels under the supervision of artist Ram Sutar that have been assembled at a workshop on the site before being clad to complete the facade in stages. The contract for the steel framework has been handed over to Malaysia-based Eversendai, which has constructed Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa – Dubai’s famous highrises.
L&T has sub-leased the “bronze cladding” of the statue to TQ Art Foundry and its workers are at present working at the site.
Rupani said that the project will not only bring out the massive personality of Sardar Patel to the world, but will also make the region a centre of tourism.
A separate society named as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust has been formed by the state government for the implementation of the project. The Union government has granted the status of National Project to the SoU.

Interacting with media persons, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said, “Those who are trying to damage the state are unable to see that when there was no agitation or any demand in the state, the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi had taken the biggest decision of making the tallest statue of Sardar Patel… When we are bringing this biggest memory of Sardar Patel to the world, some people are raising small issues and creating rifts among communities. The government has done everything that could have been done…We are working for the social harmony, safety and peace in the state.”"

The Statue of Unity (SoU) site in Kevadia village is in the spotlight again, after the Gujarat government tightened vigil around it to prevent villagers from protesting by farming on land acquired by it for building various infrastructure to boost tourism.
On June 17, the Narmada district administration formed five teams to keep vigil on the acquired farmlands in six villages around the SoU recently fenced by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL). Since then, four cases of trespassing have been registered against villagers in Gora, Navagam and Limdi.
The villages that protested in May and June when SSNNL began fencing the land after the Gujarat High Court dismissed their petitions, include Vaghadiya, Kevadia and Kothi.
The backgroundhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Gujarat government had originally acquired the land in 1961, for the construction of the Narmada dam canal and subsequently transferred possession to SSNNL, a wholly-owned Gujarat government public limited company that was incorporated in March 1989 to execute and manage the Sardar Sarovar Dam project.
SSNNL was part of the trust that built the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the government of Gujarat and continues to manage the structure. The Gujarat government, last year cleared a bill to set up a Statue of Unity Area development authority to help expedite projects in the area that is predominantly tribal.
Although the SSNNL has almost completed the fencing of the land, about 250 original landholders and their heirs are yet to accept the compensation offered by the SSNNL.
General Manager (Technical & Co-ordination) of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) M B Joshi, said, “A significant time has passed and the younger generation may not even know the facts of the compensation awarded to their forefathers. Moreover, we cannot consider the third or fourth generations of the landholders as beneficiaries. The younger generation feels they are not getting anything. The value of the cash compensation has now gone down and the market value of the lands is high. We are willing to discuss the compensation and take their suggestions.”

What villagers argue
The villagers of Limdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora say that the government had acquired the land 59 years back, for the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but is now intending to put the land to use for other commercial purposes and not for the dam, which is why the SSNNL claim on the should be invalidated.
They have been backed by the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) founded by Chhotu Vasava who has also called it the ‘Statue of Displacement’ and the Congress which also staged a demonstration against the police detaining protesting tribals.
The six villages filed a PIL in Gujarat High Court protesting the acquisition and calling the compensation offered “meagre”. The HC dismissed their petition in May, after which the SSNNL began fencing the land. After several incidents of trespassing, the police pitched a tent on one of the hillocks for a commanding vigil of the area.
On June 25, a group of women from Kevadia village led by a villager Leela Tadvi, took over the tent and declared that they would not move till the police removed it.
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadia, Vani Doodhat clarified that the tent was only for a panoramic view of the area as “there is sensitive installation with Narmada dam and Statue of Unity” and that it was not for “vigil on their land”.
Deputy Collector and Administrator of Kevadia, Nikunj Parikh says he is duty-bound to protect the land acquired by SSNNL as the administrator of Kevadia was the “custodian of the SSNNL land”. He asserts, “This will be a continuous exercise because no one can farm in the government land. We will take legal action against trespassers.”
Predominantly a population of Tadvi tribals, two of the six villages, Kevadia and Vagadiya, are bitter about being called “illegal occupants” on their own farmlands. The land acquired from both these villages faces the main road and is in close proximity to the SoU where hotels and resorts are coming up.

What SSNNL says
In its reply to the High Court, SSNNL said that the government acquired physical possession of land in five villages measuring 1814.65 acres and paid compensation packages. But since the lands were not utilised, the villagers returned to their lands and subsequently the original landholders died.
According to SSNNL, as per the Narmada Waters Dispute Tribunal (NWDT) Award of 1979, the six villages had 238 landholders, of which about 105 original landholders are yet to agree upon the compensation package. Similarly, 241 men, sons of the original landholders, were counted as beneficiaries and of these, about 120 are yet to accept the compensation.

The compensation package
As per the guidelines of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA), male heirs of a landholder, displaced due to the project, who are 18 years of age as of November 1 1989, are to be given land measuring two hectares or the original size of their land — whichever is bigger — as well as a 250 sq feet plot for animal husbandry.
The villagers have the option to choose monetary compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare (2.4 acres) of land acquired. The villagers, however, claim that the current market value of the land is about Rs 35 lakhs per acre.
SSNNL has proposed resettlement of 1000 families to an ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ project planned by expert architects, to be constructed over 16 hectares of land belonging to SSNNL in Gora village.
In addition, SSNNL has offered to allot shops in a shopping complex to be built in the SoU parking area for those whose shops were razed during the process of acquisition. SSNNL officials say this would include even those affected families, who were not part of the original list of beneficiaries.

Rights of the tribals
Kevadia colony, in Nandod taluka of Narmada district, is a Schedule V area where the provisions of Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas), Act, 1996 (PESA) are in force.
Both Schedule V and PESA provide for the rights to territorial integrity where the tribal panchayats have to decide the course of development and also land acquisition. The laws prevent any transfer of tribal lands to non-tribal entities.
However, villagers have been claiming that they have not been taken into confidence in the plan to develop Kevadia, as a tourist hub."

Five members of a family from Vadodara allegedly went missing under mysterious circumstances after visiting the Statue of Unity (SoU) in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district. A senior police officer from the district said that the family was last spotted on March 1, Sunday at Krishna Kathiyawadi hotel’s CCTV in Dabhoi, about 35 kilometers from Vadodara.
“They were seen exiting the hotel in their car, after which their phones’ location has not been tracked. Since there is no canal close to Dabhoi road, we suspect that the family may have driven back towards the canal on the Bodeli road or gone elsewhere. We are working hard to crack the mystery,” the officer said.
According to the police, Kalpesh Parmar, his wife Trupti, his mother Usha and children Niyati and Atharv — aged nine and seven respectively —had visited the SoU on Sunday. They had left home at 10 am and driven to SoU in their car. They had also posted photographs from their visit on Facebook and on their family WhatsApp groups.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
However, other family members alleged that the five never returned. Their phones have also been switched off since, the police said.
In their last conversation with their families, Kalpesh had informed his cousin that they were planning to go and meet a relative in Bharuch before returning to Vadodara. When Kalpesh’s grandfather tried to contact him on Monday morning, his phone was switched off. He then tried to contact their relative in Bharuch who informed him that Kalpesh and his family never showed up.
Kalpesh’s family members then reached Kevadia Colony and informed the police. A missing persons’ complaint has been registered and investigations are underway.
“They were also captured outside the Nutrition Park. We are examining more CCTV cameras to try and trace them. We are also getting their call details. So far, there is no lead regarding their whereabouts,” said AM Parmar, police inspector in Kevadia.
Kalpesh’s grandfather, Bhailal Parmar said, “He was into computer repairing
business. On Sunday morning, he had informed me that he was going to the Statue of Unity. When he did not return by Monday, I tried to call him but could not reach him. His cousin told me that he was going to Bharuch to meet his sister, but he was not there either. He has never done this before. It’s been three days and there is no trace of him. I don’t know if anyone in the family was facing any issues…”"

Addressing delegates from 14 countries in Hindi,Modi said that everyday 2,500 people abandon farming as profession and more than two lakh  farmers committed suicide in the past two decades. 
He suggested to the Central government that instead of slaughterhouse subsidy,warehouse subsidy would help farmers save their livestock.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At the two-day event,which the CM claimed to be the first of its kind in India,farmers from 29 states and two Union territories listened to Modis suggestions to the Prime Minister on how to revive agriculture. 
Instead of slaughterhouse subsidy,if equal amount of subsidy was given in construction of warehouses,farmers would not have to send livestock to slaughterhouses, claimed Modi.
At the event,partnered by Denmark,Modi said,Indian farmer is insecure. I have figures from the government that say that 2,500 persons are abandoning farming per day. In the past 20 years,2.70 lakh farmers have committed suicide. Less then 30 per cent farmers get loans from banks and the rest approach sharafs (private dealers).
Modi said that there was an urgent need to increase farm productivity but the Centre was ignoring suggestions made by a committee he headed. We do not lack talent,universities. Then what is the reason that productivity is low? We have nothing to map real-time production, he said,mentioning figures that throw light on how India is way behind in farm productivity compared to countries like the Netherlands,Peru,Indonesia and Ireland. 
Modi added that he had given suggestions to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh four times and thrice to the Government of India. He called for an integration of technology and e-governance with agriculture,and stressed giving benefits of IT revolution to farmers. He said the share of agriculture in GDP had dropped. From 51 per cent at the time of Independence,it has dropped to 14 per cent, he added.
Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal,who described his Gujarat counterpart as a great leader,echoed Modi in his attack on the Centre. Badal said in his address that the Centre nether consulted CMs nor took views of experts on issues pertaining to agriculture.

Illustration: Subrata Dhar.
Does size really matter? Looking at the recently commissioned works of public art and memorials for our heroes, it sure does. States seem to be competing to combat a strange sense of insecurity by commissioning public works of art that have little to offer by way of the established norms of architectural aesthetics governing space, form and colour, and instead opt for the overriding criterion of size. Is this a covert way to gain public confidence or popularity?
Who or what is responsible for keeping public tastes so abysmally low while distracting the people with non-consequential issues? This question needs to be examined in the context of a noticeable culture of feudal control in our social, cultural and political landscape that has seen a blatant resurgence in recent years. For a country clearly short on taste in public art, India is dotted with statues of heroes, mainly politicians, saints and a few sportsmen, writers and scholars. Invariably a steel stair, incorporating a landing, terminating near the head of the idol, dilutes the spatial dominance of the statue by its ugly presence. The steel structure is a contraption to reach up to garland the “neta” on auspicious occasions and to be seen doing the same.
According to reports, the government of Maharashtra is asking for an additional budgetary allocation, over the Rs 3,600 crore already sanctioned, to increase the height of the proposed Shivaji statue up from 192 metres. The only people pessimistically concerned were the fishermen around the proposed site who see this as an unwarranted intrusion in their fishing territory and income. Some individuals and groups raised objections over a project which is large on public expenditure and short on imagination. These and other voices of dissent seem to carry little weight.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Close on the heels of this venture is the proposed statue of Sardar Patel in the Narmada region which will soar to a height of 182 metres. This “statue of unity” will cost nearly Rs 3,000 crore and shall be fabricated in China, based on an Indian design. These two mortals, Shivaji and Sardar Patel, leave behind their nearest rivals with an established global presence, the Statue of Liberty at 93 metres and Christ the Redeemer at a mere 38 m. These larger-than-life Indian commissions are just a further step in the direction of the large statues of lord Hanuman and Shiva that have sprung up in several locations in recent times.
The immaculate sculpture of the traditional temples of India has not contributed to lifting the level of art appreciation for the public to any appreciable level. In fact, over time, the sense of public aesthetics has descended seamlessly into kitsch of the lowest common denomination. The Lingaraj temple complex at Puri demonstrates this ugly aesthetic side of religious autonomy, where age-old walls and sculptures have been painted and a mish-mash of unsightly steel stirrups condescendingly “support” the world -amous stone kalasha atop the main temple. So much for religious men showing concern towards heritage conservation.
This hierarchical, feudal system reflects, also, in the spatial geometry of the city. A community fed on the tragic traditions of “mai baap” and “ji hazoor” has been led somewhere along the line to believe that “big” is beautiful. Not that the public has much to choose from. Acceptable levels of the public good have continued to plummet to immeasurable depths while the political tricks department keeps the public from noticing garbage, filth, dirty roads, parks, polluted rivers and water bodies and falling public norms. We are surrounded by ugliness of all shades and hues. The role of artists and architects in shaping public taste has been painfully slow and inadequate.
The monuments and parks created by Mayawati are worth a mention here. The Noida Dalit Prerna Sthal, a Rs 685 crore venture, is a paradoxical contradiction. A park in the name of Dalit inspiration is a highly compromised version of the landmark Indo Saracenic style of architecture introduced by the British in India. The Indian habit of lionising political heroes, to such an extent that the idea that a large project can be dedicated to a theme or concept other than a person, and that too a political figure, is quite unthinkable, is on show here. The Ambedkar park in Lucknow is similarly an exercise in self-aggrandisement. The flip side of these parks is that howsoever you may disagree with the aesthetic content of these, they do provide much-needed breathing space in the city. The 43 acres in Lucknow and the 82 acres in Delhi are a permanent asset for the future of the city. Statues of political figures in stiff and rigid postures have made us oblivious to the fact that there is another side to sculptured beauty, appropriately set and modulated in space. This attitude of complete aesthetic detachment has prevented us from creating works of significance in the public domain that match momentous global landmarks such as the Manneken Pis in Brussels and the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen.
Anish Kapoor’s Cloud Gate in Chicago, also referred to as “the bean” because its shape resembles one, is a 13 m-tall sculpture of shining seamless steel polished to reflect the surroundings as a trick mirror. It is a sculpture designed, in the words of the creator, as “a space that bridges the gap between the sky and the viewer”. Tiny in size in comparison to many sculptures, it has been an instant hit after inauguration. Another memorial, the Vietnam Veterans creation in Washington D.C., by Maya Lin, was actually designed to be invisible at ground level. A series of black granite slabs fixed below ground level, with the names of soldiers and officers, lends dignity and gravity to the monument.
It is not that India is deprived of things beautiful and that we cannot appreciate good things when we are given an opportunity. The architectural marvels, such as the step wells, the forts and palaces, the most intricate jalis and carvings on Hindu as well as Islamic buildings, the stone carvings from Buddhist times to the British Raj era, are scattered across for us to see. But post-Independence, we seem to have succumbed to the systemic sycophancy of spatial dominance by a self-serving elite class, in keeping with our hierarchical social order.
Though we have not had the fortune of the Italian towns or other European cities who had the services of great masters in shaping public tastes in art and architecture, we can hope that some recent works of significance that have been taken up as open competitions in the field of art and architecture will throw up some world-class works to make us proud.

Addressing NRIs living in 20 cities of the US via video-conference,Modi gave a call to restore peoples trust in the institutions of the country. His address was part of Gujarat Day celebrations.
Going by the incidents of the past one month,we can understand how much damage a weak government can do, Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In his hour-long speech,he also lashed out at the UPA government for its weak foreign policy. The External Affairs Minister (in an apparent reference to former external affairs minister S M Krishna) of my country,while addressing an international forum,takes some other countrys papers and starts reading. It is a matter of great shame, he said.
Our soldiers are getting beheaded and after some days,Prime Minister of that country is served chicken biryani here, Modi said.
He also touched upon the recent standoff with China. China withdrew its forces to its territories,but I cannot understand why the Indian Army is pulling back its forces from our own land.
Modi also lashed out at the UPA government for alleged corruption. One has rarely seen such loathsome corruption. Even coal has not been spared, he said.
We have to restore peoples trust. This is the biggest challenge before the country. We need trust in leaders,in parties,in policies, Modi said.
Hardselling his Gujarat model, he claimed the development had even reached Kutch and other coastal regions of the state and said Gujarat had become a prominent place on the tourism map of India.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Concluding his speech,Modi sought contributions from the Indian diaspora for building the Statue of Unity near the Sardar Sarovar dam site,which will be a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The CM said the statue,proposed to be the tallest in the world,would be double the height of Statue of Liberty in New York."

For the first time, there was no garba for Navratri and Diwali that ushers in the Gujarati new year was muted.
However, the unlock period was marked by political rallies and inauguration of several tourism related projects in the state where leaders exhorted people to visit these sites.
The state saw by-elections to eight assembly seats in November, while local body polls that were scheduled in December were put off because of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, BJP chief CR Paatil and other ministers have been addressing public meetings.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On October 30, Modi spent a night at Kevadia and inaugurated 17 projects that will be a part of the Kevadia tourism circuit, housing the Statue of Unity — the tallest statue in the world, six days after he virtually inaugurated the ropeway at Girnar, claimed to be the “longest in the world”, coinciding with Dussehra that marked the end of Navratri.
The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) launched water sports at the Sabarmati River Front on New Year’s Day that would have marked the culmination of the Kankaria Carnival during the birth anniversary of late prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that coincides with Christmas.
Referring to it as “New year gift”, Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar tweeted how the water sports — jet ski, high speed boats, paddle boats and zorbing — brought in 2,350 visitors in the first week.
Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) general manager Dipak Patel says, “While a few water activities resumed, some new activities were added at the riverfront on January 1. More will be added soon.”
Before announcing the cancellation of the Kankaria Carnival, mayor Bijal Patel had said, “The country, the state and the city is going through a tough time with the coronavirus. As per the Central government’s guidelines, gathering of people at one place beyond a certain limit is not allowed. Keeping this in mind, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided that the Kankaria Carnival this year would not be organised.”
The carnival with an annual budget of Rs 5 to 10 crore includes several cultural, art and social activities turning Kankaria lake into a popular hub with footfall in lakhs.
Since the Statue of Unity was inaugurated in October 2018, the state government has worked to bring Kevadia on the world tourism map. The circuit now has 35 tourist attractions, of which the Valley of Flowers, Vishwa Van, Jungle Safari, Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Ekta Nursery, Tent City, Khalvani Eco-tourism, Zarwani Eco-tourism, Nauka Vihar and River Rafting, located around the periphery of the statue and the Narmada Dam, were already open when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated 17 more projects on October 31.
After the site reopened in September 2020, the number of visitors was capped at 2,500 per day to the Statue of Unity visitors gallery. This cap, however, did not apply to the campus. On all days, including Diwali holidays, Kevadia remained packed — from hotel rooms to tourist attractions and even the tent city. Ahead of the new year, the tickets were increased to 5,500 tickets per day, and now the limit is up to 12,000.
While inaugurating the Girnar ropeway, Modi had said how “45 lakh people had visited” the Statue of Unity before Covid-19 struck. Around 1.8 lakh people have already used the Girnar ropeway service to visit Ambaji temple on Mount Ginar near Junagadh city since its inauguration, according to Deepak Kaplish, western region head of Usha Breco Limited (UBL), the private firm that has installed the ropeway and also operates it.
“An average of 2,700 tourists use our service per day with numbers going up during the weekends. Once, during festive season, we had to seek help of police after tourists formed around a kilometre long queue outside our base station,” Kaplish added.
A senior official in Kevadia, holding charge of a tourist section, said, “We had a full house for the new year weekend. It turned into a bit of a crowd but we were able to ensure social distancing… In fact, weekends are extremely busy now. We have ensured that we have enough staff strength to manage the sanitisation and cleanliness. It is good to see activity again.”
Manager of a three-star hotel in Kevadia said, “The tourism industry suffered huge losses with agents and businesses going almost to the extent of starvation. I don’t think it would be right to call the opening up a careless move. All the establishments have been given strict advisories on Covid-19 protocol. It is here to stay and we need to get on with business. How do we sustain ourselves if tourists don’t come in? Diwali and New Year’s are the main days for tourism businesses and we are glad the government considered our pleas.”
A co-owner of another budget accommodation in Kevadia said, “It is true that the businesses never considered Covid-19 a big threat to tourists coming to Kevadia simply because it is a nature spot. It has a healing effect. We are prepared to handle the sanitisation and hygiene part. The increase in footfalls has only been gradual and it is needed… It is important to be practical. Tourism spots such as Kevadia are not like malls in cities. There is a lot of scope to follow the guidelines and the administration has done a fantastic job. No one can say that opening SoU site has has made any difference to the district’s status on the Covid-19 map.”
According to police, decision of the number of tourists to be allowed at a time was the discretion of the SoU management but the police department has been strictly enforcing the Covid-19 guidelines. “We crack down on violations. While the SoU complex is guarded by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the surrounding area is the responsibility of the district police. The crowd has been huge. Access to the SoU complex is restricted so only those with valid tickets can drive through,” said Vani Doodhat, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadia Colony.
The restrained festivals notwithstanding, the state saw a spike in Covid-19 cases soon after Diwali with the daily numbers crossing 1,200, and the government clamped a night curfew on the cities of Ahmedabad , Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara. The cases are now down to an average of 650 a day even as the night curfew continues with an hour’s relaxation.
Ruling party has an edge: Political rallies go on amid ban on gatherings, not of all parties
Soon after his appointment as Gujarat BJP president in July 2020, CR Paatil toured the state, with his roadshows in Saurashtra and South Gujarat recording huge turnouts, especially on seats that were going to by-elections in November. The Congress in Valsad protested as BJP put out photos of a packed auditorium in Pardi town in August but no action was taken.
In the same month, a rally to celebrate the appointment of Hardik Patel as Congress working president was not allowed by the Surat police citing how “religious and social gatherings” continued to be prohibited under Covid protocol. After Paatil’s roadshows in Talala and Rajkot, local Congress leaders demanded police take action against the organisers of the event but no action was taken.
Paatil had drawn large crowds in Talala, Somnath, Junagadh, Khodaldham and in Rajkot, but at a press conference in Rajkot on August 20 , the BJP president claimed he had not violated state government’s ban on public gathering due to Covid-19 pandemic.
“We have not organised any rally… If some president comes visiting and three persons are driving in his car and 100 other car joins his convoy with just three people in each of them, it can’t be called a julus (procession) or rally. It doesn’t fall under the definition of a rally as only three people are in a car, they have their mask on and they don’t assemble in a group,” he had said.

In December 2020, in an apparent counter to the farmer protests in Delhi, the state BJP organised 10 Kisan Sammelans, each attended by at least 400-500 farmers. Farmers were offered lunch also at the venues. This came barely a week after dozens of Congress leaders were detained by police as they hit the road during the nation-wide bandh call given on December 8 by farmer unions protesting in Delhi.
Days before Diwali, on November 12, Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed a sarpanch sammelan at Dhordo, the venue of the annual Rann Utsav, the same day when the desert carnival began. Around a month later, on December 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Dhordo to lay the foundation stone of a hybrid renewable energy park, and addressed a public meeting there.
With the local body elections rescheduled to February this year, Chief Minister Rupani has been touring the state launching various projects, including what the government calls the second phase of Kisan Suryodaya Yojana (KSY) in various districts, besides housing and other agriculture projects. KSY was orginally launched by PM Modi on October 24 last year.
On the other hand, leader of the Opposition, Paresh Dhanani, was detained by police when he sat on dharna alone on the campus of Shantaba Medical College and General Hospital in his home town Amreli in July to demand a laboratory in the district for Covid-19 testing. He was detained again while he rode a scooter in Amreli, soliciting public support for the nationwide bandh on December 8.
“Government detains and jails opposition leaders even as goondas roam freely… If five people gather on a terrace, government takes action against them saying the coronavirus can’t infect them. But the same Covid-19 is not a concern when BJP gathers hundreds for campaigning. Are Covid-19 and Kamal (lotus – election symbol of BJP) cousins who won’t harm each other? This is nothing but misuse of state machinery and muzzling the voice of Opposition,” Dhanani said.
Besides Dhanani, dozens of Congress leaders, including Pal Ambaliya, convenor of the farmers’ cell of state Congress were arrested on December 8 during the bandh. Congress held two indoor meetings of its workers in Rajkot as part of its preparations for the civic body polls. Its local leaders also held dharna at Sardar Chowk on Race Course Ring Road on January 7 to protest the arrest of family members of Urvashiba Jadeja, one of the former Congress corporators of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation, in an alleged case of land grabbing.

However, more than four dozen Congress workers were detained by police from Sardar Chowk for staging a dharna without police permission even as an application filed by Congress leader Mahesh Rajput with police commissioner’s office seeking permission to stage dharna was pending.
GOVERNMENT SPEAK: Jawahar Chavda, State Minister for tourism
Isn’t the government showing double standards when it restricts celebration of festivals and encourages footfalls at the new tourism sites?
The government is no longer asking people to remain indoors due to Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, we are encouraging local tourism as inter-state and international tourists, which form bulk of tourist footfalls in the state, are not travelling at all. Livelihood of a lot of people in Gujarat depend entirely on tourism activity and the Covid-19 pandemic has hit this sector the hardest. As people from outside are not turning up, our strategy is to encourage local tourism so that the tourism industry is kickstarted and people who depend on it earn something.
What about restricting visitors at the tourism sites?
There is no cap on people using the Girnar ropeway but some slab is there on the number of entry tickets issued at the Statue of Unity (SoU)… I don’t have those details. SoU is controlled by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), which does not come under my ministry. Our role is to create tourism facilities, promote them and let others run them.

Kevadia is doing very well. The tourist influx has increased exponentially. Statue of Unity, Jungle Safari, Children Nutrition Park and Cactus Garden are attracting thousands of visitors every day. On weekends, the total number of visitors exceeds 20,000. We are ensuring all Covid protocols and in addition, regularly testing thousands of staff members manning these facilities. On the New Year’s Eve, more than 1,500 people stayed here during the night, which is an indication that people are coming for longer vacations. The Orchidarium and Ekta organic Hand soap making units are new attractions added to Ekta Nursery."

(Express)
The outgoing BJP Chief Sanjay Tandon listed a bunch of development works as his achievements, while bidding goodbye to the party’s Chandigarh president post on Wednesday. Tandon said that the sanctions for the Tribune flyover, constitution of the committee for collecting iron and steel for the Statue of Unity’s construction and the organisation of the event to pay tribute to BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee were his achievements as the Chandigarh BJP president.
The achievements listed by Tandon included the increase in the number of seats for medical students in Chandigarh from 50 to 150, increase in the eligibility age for government jobs from 25 to 37. He said that he teamed up with Member of Parliament Kirron Kher to accomplish development works in the city.
Tandon credited the BJP for converting the leasehold and allowing the transfer of title to the Housing Cooperative Societies, colonies and villages in Chandigarh, which facilitated their addition to the municipality.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even though door-to-door waste segregation did not pick up in the city, it was counted as one of the achievement by Tandon, under the aegis of the Swachh Bharat Scheme. A release issued by the party said, “BJP participated along with the municipality in door-to-door canvassing to create awareness about garbage segregation across the city.”
While listing the other achievements, it was said, “The party took active steps in bringing relief to the residents of Dadumajra from their age old problem of waste accumulation in their vicinity. The BJP Chandigarh also took active steps in resolving various issues of the housing board and the party also initiated the midday meal scheme for Rs 10 for the poor.” It further added, “Manimajra residents were suffering from long traffic jams due to the railway crossing. The BJP government took effective measures by sanctioning a railway under bridge to solve this problem.”
Even though the Tribune flyover has not died out, the release counted it as an achievement. It said, “The long traffic jams at the Tribune Chowk were becoming a daily issue for the residents of the city. The BJP government also sanctioned construction of a flyover.”
Beside other points listed in the release, it that “Chandigarh became the first Kerosene free city in India by the active efforts of the BJP government. The beautification of the railway station was also taken up by the BJP government during its regime and Chandigarh also became the first city to be freed from the scourge of the open-defecation system.”
While listing his achievements and his works for the party, he said, “A committee was formulated in his leadership to collect iron and steel for the construction of the Statue of Unity and numerous awareness campaigns were successfully conducted by him.” Tandon further said, “Atal Bihari Vajpayee was paid tribute by the whole city during the Asthi Kalash Yatra in Chandigarh and every year, the party workers also hoisted the flag of BJP on its foundation day, during his tenure.”
A release by the party said, “Sanjay Tandon spearheaded various schemes like Mera Booth Sabse Majboot, Mera Ghar Bhajapa ka Ghar, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Awarenes about the abrogation of the Article 370 and 35A and triple talak was conveyed to the masses of the city. Sanjay Tandon ran an enormously elaborate campaign for the 2019 general elections, during which the party held massive public rallies.” His participation in the various elections at other cities and states were also mentioned in the official release.

"1618508091-1462","https://indianexpress.com/page/4/?s=%22Statue+of+unity%22","Explained: Why there are protests over an eco-sensitive zone in Narmada district","https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gujarat-narmada-district-eco-sensitive-zone-protests-7125774/","Explained: Why there are protests over an eco-sensitive zone in Narmada district","Updated: December 31, 2020  1:38:55 pm","Mansukh Vasava, who represents the Bharuch parliamentary constituency, resigned from the BJP on Tuesday, days after he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to withdraw the Centre’s notification classifying 121 villages around the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Narmada district as eco-sensitive zones. In a U-turn a day later, Vasava said he would withdraw his resignation.
Tribal communities have been protesting against the notification since the beginning of November, when the district administration served the first notice to execute the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) order.
Vasava, in his letter to the Prime Minister, said tribals were apprehensive as they were “not taken into confidence”, and appealed to him to withdraw the notification to “mitigate the protests”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Tribals, especially from the Tadvi and Vasava communities, have been on the edge ever since Kevadia, a sleepy village in Nandod taluka of Narmada district, was developed into a tourism circuit around the Statue of Unity.
Update |Gujarat to ‘withdraw’ revenue record entry in eco-sensitive zone
Why are tribal communities protesting against the notification?
Firstly, as per the provisions of the notification, land falling in the eco-sensitive zone — including land belonging to the forest department, horticulture department, that used for agricultural use and plots reserved for parks — cannot be transferred for non-agricultural use for commercial, industrial or residential purposes. Any land that needs to be transferred can be done so only after approval from the state government.
Second, a process has been initiated to include the state government as the co-owner of the land in the 121 villages.
Third, the notification, combined with the formation of the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority, or Statue of Unity Tourism Authority (SoUTA), by the Gujarat government to govern Kevadia, which now has increased administrative needs owing to the booming tourism, has left tribals in a state of mistrust and fear. They feel the simultaneous implementation of the two government decisions could dilute the “power” vested with villagers under the Panchayat (Extension of Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, implemented in areas notified under Schedule V of the Constitution.
Gora village Sarpanch Shanti Tadvi, who was the first to receive the notification, said, “We are not sure if this notification for the eco-sensitive zone is the first step in turning this pristine forest into something else. They have not taken us into confidence. We know the development of Kevadia for tourism happened against the will of the locals. The Ekta nursery (an allied project of SoU) and other government land in our village also belonged to our forefathers and were acquired by processes that illiterate villagers of those days could not understand. We are planning to move courts citing the Panchayat (Extension of Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, but we are poor tribals who feel we will be defeated.”
Why are political leaders joining the protests?
Not just Mansukh Vasava, several former BJP MLAs from the tribal areas have also been vocal in their opposition against the eco-sensitive zone. Former MLA from Dediapada Assembly constituency, Motilal Vasava, who is also the BJP’s state leader for the tribal cell, had written to the sarpanches of the 121 villages to use the upcoming gram sabhas to pass resolutions against the government order to implement the MoEFCC notification. One of the reasons the tribal leaders are flexing their muscles is because of the upcoming panchayat and urban local body elections.
Bhartiya Tribal Party MLA from Jhagadia in Bharuch district, Chhotu Vasava, who had abstained from voting in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections in June, said, “Our contention with both political parties — BJP and Congress — is they are unwilling to implement the Schedule V and PESA in its entirety. Tribals are indigenous and cannot be shifted and shunted out of their homes the way they have been so far. The governments, in the name of development, have been grabbing lands of tribals and selling them off to multimillionaires. Our fight is against this planned elimination of the tribal identity. PESA empowers the tribes, but that power has not been handed over to the gram sabhas.”
Chhotu Vasava recently announced an alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi’s All-India Majilis e Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) to fight the upcoming polls.

What is PESA?
Gujarat notified the State PESA Rules in January 2017, applicable in 4,503 gram sabhas under 2,584 village panchayats in 50 tribal talukas in eight districts of the state. At an event held in the tribal district of Chhota Udepur, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani hailed the Act as the “golden period of tribal development, promising a separate security force for the gram sabhas that would have complete power to decide their issues.”
While the provisions of the law deem the gram sabhas as “most competent” to deal with matters related to their territories for safeguarding their customs, traditions as well as the natural resources in the tribal areas, the Act has not been enforced in letter and spirit, legal experts say.
Advocate Bhushan Oza, who has been representing tribal groups, said, “The PESA Act is totally rooted in the cultural and traditional practices of the tribal community and vests ultimate power to the gram sabha to make administrative decisions. But that is not the ground reality.”

What is SoUTA? Does it contradict PESA?
The government passed the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority or the SoU Tourism Authority (SoUTA) Bill last year. The SoUTA has powers ranging from acquiring land for any development project to taking punitive action against those violating/encroaching it. The authority will define the limits of the tourism development area and will be empowered to acquire immovable property under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. It will largely work as a local body that will prepare and execute a development plan or a town planning scheme, remove encroachments and provide civic amenities like water supply, transportation, power supply, drainage, hospitals, medical services, schools, public parks, markets, shopping places, and disposal of waste, among others. The Bill sets aside Rs 10 crore from the consolidated fund of the state for the discharge of functions and duties by SoUTA.
The police, as per the Bill, can assist the authority in prohibiting “any nuisance being caused or prevent any such activity, process, the operation being carried out,” if it opines that it will damage or deteriorate the “tourism potentiality” of the area.
As per the Bill, “Expenses and costs incurred, if any, in removing or abating such nuisance, shall be recovered as an arrear of land revenue from the person who has caused such nuisance.” Persons who fail to comply with directions given by the authority shall be punishable with imprisonment for up to a month or with a fine up to Rs 50,000, or both. The offence will also be treated as “cognisable and non-bailable”. Persons authorised can enter any land or building between sunrise and sunset by giving its occupant a notice of at least 24 hours. The Bill also shields the proposed authority and its members from any legal proceeding or prosecution “for anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of the provisions of this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder.”
In June this year, after the SSNNL finished fencing village farmlands that were in possession of their owners although the formal acquisition was made in 1961, the deputy director of Kevadia colony also formed teams to book villagers trespassing into the lands. As many as five cases have been booked so far.
While activists and legal experts feel the Act will overpower the provisions of PESA, officials say rules of SoUTA are yet to be clarified.
Last week, the General Administration Department of the Gujarat government for the first time opened management positions for SoUTA with 201 stipulated vacancies at various levels to look after the future requirements of the town, including revenue, law and order, administrative, medical, town planning, fire and emergency services, solid waste management and sanitation. The SoUTA, that will designate the area under it as a separate governance unit, will be led by a CEO, who will be assisted by two deputy district collectors as well as officers for revenue, health, tourism, fire safety and town planning.

The Gujarat government’s position
The Gujarat government has decided to go ahead with its plan to formalise the creation of the new authority for the SoU, which has been aggressively marketed as a tourism destination. On December 23, the state government announced details of SoUTA, where the first circle will include administrators for the Statue of Unity, Shreshth Bharat Bhavan, Gora bridge navigation channel, Jetty service and overall maintenance of the complex.
The second circle will include the administrators for all other projects around SoU.

The ‘Statue of Unity’, described by the Gujarat government as the world’s tallest, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, on the birth anniversary of India’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Sunday.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the BJP’s national executive meeting, Rupani said the statue with a height of 182 metres will be a symbol of the country’s unity and integrity.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had collected iron, soil and water from across the country to use them to build the statue in the state, a decision announced by Modi in 2013 when he was its chief minister.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In an apparent reference to the issue of Naxalism following the arrest of some activists for allegedly collaborating with Left ultras, Rupani said the statue will highlight Patel’s works for the country’s unity at a time when a few people are working to break it.
When Modi had made an announcement that his government would build the world’s tallest statue to commemorate Patel, opposition parties had termed it as “empty talk” but it has now been raised with world-class facilities, he said.
While the Congress had sidelined Patel, Modi has brought him and his works in front of the world, he claimed.
In August, Rupani and his number two, Nitin Patel, had inspected the progress of the project on Sadhu Bet. Engineering giant Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) has got the tender of design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance of the statue at a cost of around Rs 2,980 crore.
Patel, a Congress leader, has become a revered figure for the BJP which has sought to project an ideological connect between its espousal of nationalism and his efforts to integrate hundreds of states and regions into India following its independence.

Unlike the usual poojan of Victory Tower and firework display at night, the Junagadh Liberation Day will be a day-long affair this Sunday featuring rally, and ceremonies to launch public projects worth more than Rs 30 crore as well as felicitation of those who fought under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to oust the then Nawab of Junagadh.
“Sardar led the fight against the Arzi Hukumat (government in exile ) of the Nawab and liberated Junagadh. Coincidentally, state and Central governments are also in the process of paying grand tribute to the Iron Man of India by building his 182-metre high statue, called the Statue of Unity. So, the celebrations to mark the 68th Liberation Day of Junagadh will apparently bear a Sardar signature,” Jitendra Hirapara, mayor of Junagadh said on Thursday.
Incidentally, the BJP had captured power from Congress in the Junagadh Municipal Corporation (JMC) after winning civic elections this July. The proposed Statue of Unity is a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had initiated it during his days as chief minister of Gujarat. The statue is proposed to come up on an island in Narmada river, downstream the Narmada dam in Narmada district. The state government recently issued work order for the around Rs 3,000 crore project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As is customary, the celebrations will begin with poojan (worshipping) of Victory Tower on the ground of Bahauddin College in Junagadh. It was here that Sardar Patel had addressed the first public meeting after the Nawab escaped to Pakistan and Junagadh was liberated on November 9, 1947.
“The poojan will follow a public meeting where completed development works will be dedicated to the public while foundation stones of others will be laid. A similar programme will also be organised in the evening. These projects are worth Rs 30 crore approximately,” Hirapara further said.
Chairman of the standing committee of JMC, Sanjay Koradiya said foundation stones will be laid for development of the historic Damodar Kund and Narsinh Mehta Choro at the cost of Rs 7 crore and Rs 4 crore respectively. “Besides, a LED lighting project on the road from Majewadi Gate to Bhavnath Taleti and 24 newly installed high-mast lighting towers will be dedicated to the public. Newly built urban health centre and a community hall will also be dedicated to the public. By these programmes, we have sought to join public welfare projects with the Liberation Day celebrations,”said Koradiya.
The twin ceremonies will be followed by a public rally to raise awareness about cleanliness under the banner of “Liberated Junagadh, Clean Junagadh”. It will begin from Sardar Patel statue in Kalva Chowk and end at Bahauddin College ground where fireworks will be displayed. Around 12 persons who fought the rule of Nawab will also be felicitated before a musical evening, Koradiya further said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The Congress-ruled JMC used to mark the day by poojan of the Victory Tower, felicitation of liberation soldiers and musical night as well as illuminating JMC main office. The mayor said they would take a call if any other important building will also be illuminated on Sunday."

A total of 25 tableaux would participate in the parade, with 16 of them belonging to states and the union territories.
States registering their presence this year on the Rajpath include Assam, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, while newly-born Telangana will make its Republic Day debut.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Besides, tableaux on Narendra Modi-led government’s ‘Make in India’, ‘Jan Dhan Yojna’ and ‘Beti Bachchao Beti Padhao’ policies will also find their place on the ceremonial boulevard at the 66th Republic Day.
Senior officials of the Defence Ministry said among the vibrant and majestic culture and “smart ideas” of the country on display, two would particularly appeal to US President Barack Obama, who will be the Chief Guest on the occasion.
“I think among all the vibrant tableaux on display before him, two particularly would exercise a greater appeal on his senses. The ‘Make in India’ tableau as well as the ‘Beti Bachchao, Beti Padhao’ one, helmed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development,” Public Relations Officer, Defence, Dhananjay Mohanty said.
The ‘Make in India’ tableau features a giant-sized 3D lion made out of gear tooth-wheels, reflective of the policy logo.
The ‘Beti Bachao…’ tableau will showcase women performing traditional dances while sending out a strong message of stopping female foeticide and promoting girl child education.
Among the states, which have missed the bus this year include Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha, Kerala and Delhi.
Amid murmurs that many states where BJP was not in power were not included in the parade, Mohanty said that “all selections were based on merit and performance only.”
“The selection process is rigorous and merit-based. All tableaux have made the cut after going through that procedure only,” he said.
Among the nine tableaux from Union ministries and departments, Indian Railways will showcase its ambition plan to connect India through high-speed rail network, by displaying a model of a bullet train."

The country is facing a lockdown that is going to have a far reaching impact on the economy,” said noted environment activist Rohit Prajapati.
Following a proposal from the Gujarat government to develop water aerodromes and boost tourism at two locations in the state — near the Statue of Unity (SOU) in Narmada district and Shatrunjay Dam in Bhavnagar district — an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Union Ministry of Forest, Environment & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has framed the Terms of Reference (ToR) for carrying out an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) of the two projects.
A few environmental activists have raised questions over concerns for the environment and the priorities of the central and state governments at a time when the country is in the midst of a strict lockdown, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, that is likely to have an adverse impact on the economy.
To implement the two projects, the government is required to take an Environment Clearance from the MoEF&CC, and EIA is necessary for the same.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The EAC of MoEF had framed the ToR for the two projects on April 22 in a meeting held through video conferencing that was attended by its chairman, T Haque and 11 other members. As per the minutes of the meeting, the water aerodromes have been proposed by the Civil Aviation Department of the Gujarat government at Panchmukhi Lake (Lake – 3) of Sardar Sarovar Dam in Limdi Village of Narmada district, and at Shatrunjay Dam in Bhavnagar district of Saurashtra region “to boost tourism.” The total cost of the two projects is estimated at Rs 25 crore.
The minutes of the meeting recorded, “The project proponent informed the EAC that Water Aerodrome is primarily on water, intended to be used… for the arrival, departure and movement of seaplanes… Seaplane operation … will extend the connectivity to those areas where there is no land-based airport… Govt. of Gujarat shall follow safety regulations, maintain good housekeeping and judiciously operate pollution control facilities to meet the prescribed norms and shall promote environment friendliness. This project can be set-up with minimal or negligible adverse environmental impact.”
The ToR has included various aspects like excavation and its impact, plan for deplane waste management, impact of noise on wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, flora and fauna in the region, traffic management and traffic decongestion plan, onsite disaster management plan and status of any pending litigation. The project proponents have also been asked to conduct a public hearing and include all issues raised in the final EIA report.
“These are projects of luxury and should be avoided in current circumstances. The country is facing a lockdown that is going to have a far reaching impact on the economy. There are talks of austerity and the MoEF&CC is framing ToR for such projects. Is it the government’s priority? … India should put such projects on the backburner,” said noted environment activist Rohit Prajapati. “It seems a non-serious discussion of the two projects. The EAC should have discussed a number of critical aspects related to the projects before framing the ToR.”
Another environment activist Krishnakant said, “It is shocking and surprising that (without EIA) the EAC could digest a sentence from the project proponents, that the project can be set up with minimal or negligible adverse environmental impact.” He also raised questions regarding why the Gujarat government was prioritising such projects when the state is fighting Covid-19.
When contacted, Civil Aviation Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, “At present, Gujarat government’s priority is only Corona.” He added that an appropriate decision will be taken for the two projects after consultation with the concerned authorities."

US President Barack Obama is likely to be “exposed” to outdoors for one hour 48 minutes during the Republic Day parade according to a detailed, minute-by-minute programme that has been circulated among the ministries. According to the schedule, Obama will be arriving at Rajpath with President Pranab Mukherjee at 9.57 am and will remain present there till 11.45 am when the parade concludes.
As reported earlier by this paper, the officials of US secret service had expressed concerns of Obama’s outdoor exposure, and wanted to reduce it — Obama’s outdoor public event exposure is normally limited to a maximum of 45 minutes.
Defence ministry sources, however, said Obama is the nation’s guest and that “there has not been a tradition when the chief guest leaves the ceremony midway through the parade or the possibility that the parade will be cut short to suit the convenience of the chief guest”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The parade, which is also Narendra Modi’s first as, PM will begin with him visiting Vijay Chowk at 9.40 am where he will lay wreath at Amar Jawan Jyoti. Within 10 minutes, Modi will be arriving at Rajpath and will be followed by the arrival of Vice-President Hamid Ansari at 9.53 am.
While the “chief guest’s spouse” Michelle Obama will be arriving along with President Pranab Mukherjee’s wife, Mukherjee and Obama are slated to arrive at 9.57 am. This will be followed by the formation of President’s bodyguard and commencement of the parade at 10.05 am.
Defence ministry sources said there was “no official confirmation regarding Michelle’s presence” at the parade.
The parade is also set to bear the imprint of PM Modi. While the contingent of women officers of all the three services will participate in the parade for the first time, ministries’ tableaux will include — Beti Bachao Beti Padhao by Ministry of Women and Child Development, PM’s pet Jan Dhan Yojna by Department of Financial Services, Maa Ganga by CPWD, Make in India by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ayush and ‘Indian Railway on fast track to the future’ by the Ministry of Railways.
Interestingly, Modi’s home state will be displaying the Statue of Unity: Sardar Sarovar project. The statue had formed a part of BJP’s Lok Sabha campaign.

Protests are being held, viewpoints are being expressed, enough. You can’t have two parallel forums – the Supreme Court and somewhere else,” said Gogoi.
Former Chief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi on Monday referred to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as a “parallel forum” and appealed to people to “trust the judiciary” to take a decision in the matter.
“The Citizenship Amendment Act is an issue. You may have a view about it, I may have a view about it, our views may not match. I have a right to express my view, you have a right to express your view, fine. But the resolution must be through constitutional means. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court… trust your judges, they’ll decide according to the Constitution. Protests are being held, viewpoints are being expressed, enough. You can’t have two parallel forums – the Supreme Court and somewhere else,” said Justice (retd) Gogoi who was in Gandhinagar to deliver a public lecture on “Rebuilding the judiciary: Nation building”, his first public address after retirement.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was also present at the public lecture organised by the Gujarat National Law University (GNLU).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Appealing to students to rebuild the judiciary and assist in nation-building, Gogoi referred to the protests in Assam, his home state, and said, “The protests over Citizenship Amendment Act began from my state, although the problem of my state is different from the problem of the rest of the country. I had just retired and reached Guwahati… after five days of intense trouble, the student community (that was spearheading the protests) said, ‘We will call off all our protest move at 5 in the evening. After sundown, no protests’. The law and order became alright overnight. This is the role of students… There are elements who want to harm the integrity of the country and the students solved it… A former Chief justice of India who has been a judge for about 20 years, is appealing to you, do something about the judiciary, think about it. My judiciary is not working — the way I want and perhaps the way you want. The moment we have a fearless, independent, effective, working judiciary, the nation will be on the march.”
Emphasising that something requires to be “rebuilt”, when “everything is broken”, Justice Gogoi cited Wikipedia data and said, “India in terms of population is Number 2. Happiness… how are we doing? India is ranked 140 out of 156. There’s something wrong somewhere. If someone had a choice of where to be born, India is positioned at 66 out of 80 countries… In freedom of press index, it is 140 out of 180. Democracy ranking, 65 out of 112. Air quality index, 84 out of 92… I don’t think we are doing too well.”
For a $5-trillion economy, rebuilding the judiciary is essential, Justice Gogoi said, adding, “When we talk of judiciary, we talk of independence of judiciary, the collegium and pendency of cases… The Prime Minister of the country mentioned about $5-trillion economy… You want a $5-trillion economy, rebuild the judiciary as Sardar Patel built the nation. The judiciary you have today, is not going to bring you $5-trillion economy… We talk about foreign investments. Why would foreign investments come? Investments means disputes and disputes require resolution and if you don’t have a mechanism of resolution of disputes, why would anyone want to come?…” He emphasised that unless the judiciary is rebuilt, the country cannot prosper, and said increasing the number of courts or fast-tracking appointment procedure wouldn’t “get us anywhere”.
The retired judge, however, noted that he “could not have said this, two months ago”, prior to his retirement. The former CJI retired on November 17, 2019. “Judges don’t have freedom of speech,” he said and thanked Gujarat “for giving me the first whiff of freedom of speech”.
Hailing Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel’s role in “nation-building”, Justice Gogoi said, “Can you imagine what would have happened if the 500 princely states had not been integrated into a nation called ‘India’?… One of the main reasons for the British taking over India is disintegration within the country. A disunited country is an easy prey… perhaps the most important of our fundamental duties is the respect for unity and integrity of the country.” The former CJI visited the Statue of Unity on Sunday along with his wife, Rupanjali, who was present among the audience at GNLU."

Last Friday (November 9) marked the 13th death anniversary of former President of India, K R Narayanan. An outstanding scholar and a former vice-chancellor of JNU, he has been hailed as a great president. However, the present ruling dispensation consciously ignored him.
His legacy in defending the idea of India, the Constitution, secularism and promoting scientific humanism has immense significance in our times. His idea of India, which animated his life and work, is in total contrast to Hindutva — a divisive, communal and fascist ideology. Hindutva seeks to polarise people in a calculated manner. It seeks the construction of a temple at the site of the Babri mosque, which was demolished. It recalls the dangerous theory of clash of civilisations advocated by Samuel Huntington, who flagged perpetual conflicts triggered by faultlines of religions and civilisations.The Hindutva forces want India to be a theatre where civilisations clash.
President Narayanan’s was a refreshing voice of sanity that refuted the theory of clash of civilisations. In his Maulana Azad Memorial Lecture, he argued that civilisations never clash, but barbarians do. He said civilisations meet and their meeting ground becomes a confluence of ideas, values and commonalities of creeds. In these trying times, in Narayanan’s words, marked by the upsurge of a counter-revolution, a confluential approach is a categorical imperative.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The President of our Republic takes the oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law and devote himself or herself to the service of India. President Narayanan adhered to the letter and spirit of the oath and protected the Constitution from review by the then government, headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The speech drafted by the then government for Narayanan to deliver in Parliament had included the suggestion of a review of the Constitution. He had no option but to deliver that speech.
However, Narayanan spoke about the move later by recalling the words of the first President of India, Rajendra Prasad, who had said the failure to implement the Constitution should not be blamed on the Constitution but on those who failed to implement it. In his eloquent speech on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Republic, he wondered: “Let us examine if the Constitution has failed us or we have failed the Constitution.” It forced the Vajpayee government to abandon the project to review the Constitution and seek a review of the working of the Constitution.
At the unveiling of the Statue of Unity, Prime Minister Modi highlighted the examples of Hyderabad and Junagarh, kingdoms ruled by Muslim rulers, and stated that without Sardar Patel, an Indian citizen would have needed a visa to travel to those states. When President Narayanan unveiled the majestic statue of Patel in front of the Central Hall of Parliament in 1998, he referred to the refusal of the princely state of Travancore to join the Indian Union. The dewan of Travancore, C P Ramaswamy Iyer, invoked Lord Padmanabha as the repository of sovereignty of that princely state and asserted that the Hindu deity would not be subservient to the sovereignty of India. Patel sarcastically asked the dewan as to how Lord Padmanabha was subjected to British suzerainty.
Narayanan’s speech on Patel taught that the Sardar united India despite challenges posed by princely rulers in the name of faith, be it Islam or Hinduism. In the same speech, he said with sensitivity that building a statue of Sardar Patel would not complete our duty to him; Patel would have expected us to affirm our Indianness without reducing it to narrow categories.
Narayanan would constantly remind that secularism is the basis of India’s unity. He also interpreted secularism as a struggle for women’s rights and dignity. It has particular significance at a time when bigotry and sectarianism in the name of faith is narrowing the space for women who face assault and harassment in all spheres. His description of B R Ambedkar as a compassionate rebel and his approach to integrate the vision of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Ambedkar for nation-building underlined his confluential approach.
The New Year card he issued on January 1, 2000, was designed on his instructions and its inner cover carried a photograph of Albert Einstein with Jawaharlal Nehru.

Modi is scheduled to arrive in Ahmedabad on March 12 to flag off 21-day march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi in Navsari district to mark the anniversary of historic Salt March which will also mark the launch of the celebrations of 75th year of Independence.
Another government official connected with the matter said, “The PM is expected on March 12 at the function near Sabarmati Ashram. The Dandi March is going to be flagged off from the Ashram with 81 marchers. The marchers will take the same route which was taken by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930.

“The National Committee includes dignitaries and eminent citizens from all walks of life. The Committee will provide policy direction and guidelines for formulation of programs for the commemoration of 75th anniversary of Indian Independence, at the national and international levels…The celebrations are proposed to be launched 75 weeks prior to 15th August 2022 i.e. on 12 March, 2021, which is the 91st anniversary of the historic Salt Satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi. In order to discuss modalities relating to preparatory activities under the commemoration beginning from 12th March 2021, with the members of High Level Committee, it has been decided to convene the first meeting of the Committee on 8th March 2021,” the statement added.
“PM Modi is scheduled to arrive on March 12 to attend a programme at Sabarmati Ashram where he will also flag off Dandi March. The exact details of the March 12 programme are being fixed by the Central Government and will be final shortly. An official announcement will be done then,” a top government official said.
The March 12 programme is likely to be a big-scale event especially when the central and Gujarat government are planning to consolidate around 63 buildings related to Mahatma Gandhi around the Sabarmati Ashram and turning them into a “world class memorial”, work for which has begun.

The redevelopment of the Gandhi Ashram commonly known as the Sabarmati Ashram, a brainchild of the Prime Minister, plans to consolidate 55 acres of land in and around the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (SAPMT) , which houses the Hriday Kunj.
The Ashram premises will eventually have only three owners as per the plan — the Gujarat government, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and the SAPMT — instead of the six trusts that are currently aligned with it.
On Saturday Modi will join the conference with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Kevadia on Friday on a two day visit to attend the Conference, landing at Vadodara airport on Friday afternoon and taking a chopper to Kevadia.

The district administration of Narmada district has created four additional helipads to help travel of the top dignitaries of the defence forces. The Chiefs of the forces as well as the dignitaries had arrived in Kevadia on Thursday evening, a day in advance and are put up at the tent city. Singh will also be staying over at night in one of the luxury suites in the tent city.
On Friday, following his arrival in Kevadia, Singh first visited the Statue of Unity along with Chief of the Army Staff General MM Naravane, Navy Chief Admiral Kadambir Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and IAF Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria. Singh tweeted about his experience of visiting the SoU and added that the conference will see discussions and review of “India’s security situation and defence preparedness”.

A defence official told this newspaper that the conference is likely to discuss in detail the combined future operations and strategy of India’s defence forces in the context of the conflict with China, which has been on for close to ten months. “The conference is attended by close to 60 top officials of the three forces. Compared to the previous years, this year the conference is more interactive. It couldn’t be held last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”
Kevadia has turned into a restricted zone in view of the conference. The district police has also issued prohibitory orders for flying drones over the area during the ongoing conference."

After the 182-meter tall `Statue of Unity’ of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gujarat may get a gigantic Buddha statue. Sanghakaya Foundation, a non-profit Buddhist organisation, said Thursday that it has demanded land from the government for installing an 80-feet high statue of Lord Buddha in Gandhinagar district.
It has roped in Ram Sutar, the sculptor behind the Statue of Unity, for the project, it said.
“We are expecting to get land soon,” president of the foundation Bhante Prashil Ratna told reporters.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Statue of Unity, inaugurated in Narmada district of the state on October 31, is the tallest statue in the world.
Bhante Prashil Ratna also said that the foundation is planning to set up a Buddhist University in Gujarat.
“Contrary to the belief that ancient Buddhist sites exist only in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and further to the north, Gujarat too has been blessed with such sites,” he said.
“Like Nalanda and Takshashila, records of Chinese traveller Xuanzang mention that there was a big Buddhist university called Vallabhi at Bhavnagar in Gujarat,” he said.
“As (ancient) Nalanda university has been revived, we wish to revive Vallabhi university here,” he said.
“The state government has given us land in Gandhinagar where we are planning to start a university on Buddhism,” he said.
The foundation also plans to build a grand monument at Dev Ni Mori, a Buddhist archaeological site in Sabarkantha district of north Gujarat, he said.
“During the excavation at Dev Ni Mori, two km from temple town of Shamlaji, they found ashes of Lord Buddha….The government has sanctioned the land and a monument will be built at the cost of Rs 1,200 crore,” he said.
A Buddhist monastery was also found during excavation in Vadnagar, the hometown of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said."

The Narendra Modi government has put on hold the allotment of a confidential public relations contract through the information department,which was supposed to promote Gujarats growth story.
Soon after the earlier contract with a similar PR firm ended,tenders were invited in June. At this time,Modi was the chairman of the campaign committee. But in September when Modi was anointed as the BJPs prime ministerial candidate,this was put on the back-burner.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
One of the main reasons cited for this was that Modi,who has already established himself as a national leader,does not need to sell the Gujarat development saga any more,which is one of the briefs for the PR firm.
The Gujarat growth story is now being told and sold. It has already transformed Modi into the top national leader from a CM. His campaign now focuses on national issues and personalities, said a top level official from the information department. Brand
Gujarat has been created. With that already being done,the department is not in a hurry to go for a new contract,though the previous contract has lapsed, he added.
The technical sessions for the firms qualified in the initial bidding process was held in August end,as the government did not seem interested to renew the contract for the Delhi-based agency that ended after its three years contract period. Six firms had cleared the technical bids and two of them had been short-listed .The decision is now pending with the top leadership of the state, an official said.
Meanwhile,sources within the ruling party and Chief Ministers Office maintained that while the Gujarat growth stories have served their role of a launch pad for Modi,now the campaign has gone to the next level through few but high profile events organised by Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG),the BJP machinery,especially the youth wings,team of his cyber volunteers and technocrats.
Besides,the Gujarat government machinery is already working on the Statue of Unity project which will help network with the grassroots even in constituencies where the BJP has no roots.
The fine prints of confidential tender,copy of which is available with The Indian Express,had defined firms target as publication of six major stories from the state in a quarter in national newspapers,vernaculars of major languages and also in national news channels.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The PR re-prioritising is also reflected in Modis blogs. From writing about achievements in power and energy sectors and road network in Gujarat,it talks more about how his candidature has set the Sensex rallying,created a positive outlook for national economy and his short-listing as the only Indian in the Person of the Year survey by an international magazine. Even the BJP press releases on Modi events end up paraphrasing his comparisons of the BJP and Congress at the national level."

(File)
Gujarat tribal leader and Jhagadia MLA Chhotu Vasava wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the land acquisition in six villages of Garudeshwar taluka in Narmada district around the Statue of Unity (SoU), where tribals have been protesting against the fencing of a land by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL).
Vasava, in his letter, has said that the Gujarat government is forcefully acquiring lands of tribals in order to sell them to “millionaire businessmen” for construction of hotels.
Residents of six villages around the Statue of Unity — Limbdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora — have been up in arms since mid-May when SSNNL began the process of fencing the land. The department had sought the land, 60 years ago for the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but now intends to put the land to use for other projects allied with SoU. The villagers have contended that the land must not be used for commercial purposes and the SSNNL claim on the land should be invalidated.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In a ten-point letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging “resolution of problems faced by tribals”, Vasava, who is an MLA from Bhartiya Tribal Party, floated along with his son Mahesh Vasava –an MLA from Dediapada constituency in Narmada — has said, “The said land in question was acquired in the year 1961-62 from tribals for the construction of the Narmada Dam. Subsequently, the location of the dam was changed and the land remained unutilised. Now (the government) has begun acquiring the land in order to sell it to millionaire businessmen for building a hotel industry. This commercial sale of the land should be immediately stopped.”
Vasava has also demanded a “judicial inquiry” into the police action against the protesting villagers. The letter stated, “There should be a judicial inquiry into the police violence and torture meted out to the tribal families of these six villages by the Kevadia administration. These villagers are not even benefitted by the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam and its affiliated projects despite being locals.”
Vasava has also pointed out that several tribals across the country have been denied right to their own land due to the forceful acquisitions. “Even basic health care facilities are missing from these areas. They do not have access to even basic medicines and medical staff and have to turn to cities, travel long distances in case of medical problems,” Vasava has said. Jhagadia Assembly Constituency is located in Bharuch District.
Kevadia Colony in Nandod taluka of the district, which is home to the 182-metres tall Statue of Unity, does not yet have even a Primary Health Centre (PHC). The nearest PHC is located in Garudeshwar taluka, which is common to about 70 villages around, making up a population of close to 80,000.
On Tuesday, Narmada Police detained a 55-year-old man from Kevadia who threatened to immolate himself, under preventive action for a chapter proceeding under CrPC and produced him before an Executive Magistrate on Wednesday."

Speaking at the state BJP headquarters,Modi asked partymen not to ridicule or belittle the vanquished Opposition in the aftermath of polls irrespective of whatever they do to me…I will deal with them in my own way.
The CM said the results proved the people had voted for security,peace and development and not for false propaganda despite scary predictions by naysayers. I may not have a place in the media space but I am certainly ensconced in the hearts of my people.. I will win over the media also in the coming days with sheer love and affection because we want to serve this nation, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asking party workers not to grow bigger than the party,he said the BJP was like mother to him and no son can be bigger than his mother. Modi dedicated the victory to party workers,including himself,who played their respective roles assigned to them. 
Pledging to serve people with more vigour,he said the victory also meant greater responsibility of rising to expectations of voters and fulfilling their aspirations. Speaking in Hindi,he said he chose the language to emphasise the nationwide significance of the victory.
The BJPs journey of victory began from Chotila via Kathlal to Ahmedabad and will go on to local body elections,Modi said,adding the BJP in Gujarat never accepted the politics of negativity and that healthy criticism was acceptable but not allegations. That is why,he said,those undermining constitutional institutions and misusing them did not win. 
Without naming the Congress,he said people were teaching them lesson after lesson but they were just refusing to learn.
Mentioning his controversial announcement about Statue of Unity,he said the people had a sixth sense with which they would spot the real intent behind what was being said. In this context,he said the Oppositions advertisement about ten-headed demon had backfired on them. We dont release advertisements but simply address public meetings, he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

In a strong response to former Gujarat Chief Minister Suresh Mehta alleging discrepancies in the land acquisition process around the Statue of Unity (SoU) site, Forest Minister Ganpatsinh Vasava, on Tuesday, contended that the welfare of the tribal population has always been the state government’s priority and every decision has been taken after due consultation with them.
Addressing the media in Surat, Vasava listed how the SoU and the subsequent development projects around the area have provided jobs to the tribal youth. In 11 months, with a footfall of over 26 lakh national and international tourists, over a 100 youths have been working as guides at the SoU premises, with 70 more guides roped in jungle safaris, he said. “Multiple welfare projects including pucca houses, water treatment plants, concrete roads have been undertaken to develop the villages around SoU,” he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Calling the former CM a ‘sidelined politician’, Vasava said, “These politicians who have been sidelined and pushed to the margins, are trying to stay relevant by talking about the displaced tribals and using them for their political gains. People who have no association with the tribals in Kevadia have been misguiding them. Many people for their own political gains have also been brainwashing the innocent tribal population around SoU.”"

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) of the Western region has dismissed a petition filed by Vadodara based environmental activists against Gujarat government’s ambitious ‘Statue of Unity’ project, demanding a stay on the construction of the project, claiming that it does not have environmental clearance.
The NGT, on Thursday, dismissed the petition based on the grounds of “limitation”, leaving it open to the petitioners to approach another competent court of law.

The NGT dismissed the petition against Statue of Unity on grounds of limitation as the petitioners had approached the tribunal in March 2015, six months after the Gujarat government handed over the work order to L&T.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rohit Prajapati, who is among the ten activist petitioners in the case said, “The tribunal said that although the case has merit, we should have approached the tribunal within six months after the foundation stone for the project was laid in October 2013. Our argument was that the clarity on the project was available only once the work order was given out, for us to ascertain environmental violations. We urged the tribunal to not set a precedent for environmental violations in such projects.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of preparing a strategy based on lies in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh and said the opposition party has three Chief Minister candidates and over a dozen others have the same aspiration. During an interaction with the BJP’s booth-level workers in five Lok Sabha constituencies — Hoshangabad in MP, Chatra in Jharkhand, Pali in Rajasthan, Ghazipur in UP and Mumbai (North) — through video conferencing via the NaMo app.
When a party worker from Hoshangabad alleged that Congress was indulging in propaganda on lies for the MP polls, the Prime Minister said, “Congress is in a condition that three chief ministerial candidates in the state are busy pulling each other’s leg and over a dozen others are in the second line who are not speaking presently but they are playing games to raise themselves if those three get out of the race…where over a dozen people have aspirations for the CM post, what will they do for your development? They neither have any policy nor an intention of development. In that situation, they are busy drawing strategy based on falsehoods.”
Modi added that it was the responsibility of the BJP workers to “expose such strategies”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Prime Minister also said the BJP’s opponents in MP do not have issues. “Our development work has depressed them so much that they have stooped to rubbish activities. To oppose, sometimes they come out with a flyover of Pakistan and sometimes they show a photograph of Bangladesh. Sometimes fake news and sometimes misleading photographs.”
He said the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government has done so much work for the welfare of people from every section that it was impossible for the Congress to raise questions on these works.
The Prime Minister also said the Congress was depressed, disappointed and has lost ground in the state. “In MP, Congress has no agenda of development. It appears that they are left with nothing to oppose,” he said.
On remarks from the Congress leaders on the Statue of Unity, which is going to unveiled on October 31, he said Congress was spreading falsehood to mislead people and accused the party of insulting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The Prime Minister said Congress was not criticising him or the Gujarat government but were expressing their “hatred” against Patel. “History is witness to how much hatred and disrespect was in their (Congress) heart against Patel. They can not accept that a son of a poor farmer family, who had risen in his life with hard work, becomes part of history…sometimes they call Statue of Unity ‘made in China’ and sometimes compare it with shoes… they are insulting Sardar Patel,” he said, adding, “laanat hai aisi rajneeti par (shame on such politics).”
The Prime Minister said Congess had treated Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Acharya Kripalani and Bhimrao Ambedkar and a number of other great personalities in the same manner."

It is a common sight to see giraffes using their tongues to navigate through acacia leaves due to its fondness for the majestic tree known as acacia auricuriformis. The only difference is that the enclosure inside the Kevadia safari park does not have the actual Acacia tree. Instead, the zoo management has been fetching the daily quantity of acacia leaves from trees from the fodder farm run by the forest department, outside the park and fastening it to another tree inside the enclosure for the giraffe to get a sense of its “natural habitat”.
Everyday, close to 20 kilos of acacia leaf branches and twigs make their way into the enclosure for the three-year-old female giraffe, which is now the only surviving of the four that were shipped into the park in October 2019 from Africa. Officials at the zoo told The Indian Express that the attempts to grow acacia trees inside the enclosure have failed so far thus giving rise to the need of bringing in the fresh leaves everyday.
An officer of the Sardar Patel Zoological Park said, “We had planted a few acacia trees in the Safari park when it was being developed but it did not survive because the animals grazed it. Thereafter the occupants of the enclosure arrived and the second attempt went unsuccessful as they would graze on the sapling. Acacia takes about three years to grow to a desirable height for the giraffe. So, we have planted about 70 trees from the forest department outside the safari and we fetch fresh branches to suffice for one day for the giraffe.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The officer added that the branches of acacia as well as the twigs are tied on the branch of another commonly found tree inside the enclosure in order to allow the giraffe to feed in standing position with its head raised to the meal. The meals also include green fodder and maize with natural grass at times, but acacia is a must have.

The officer added that giraffes are always found near acacia trees as the ear turned leaves make their favourite meal. “Giraffes have a fondness for Acacia leaves because they are extremely sweet and the trees grow very tall. In their natural habitat, they chew on acacia leaves. The tree and the giraffes share a unique relationship in the wild. Since giraffes keep eating up the leaves, the tree develops a mechanism of its own to grow thorns to deter the giraffe but the species has adapted to this and has a better skill to manoeuver through the thorns and eat the leaves. They use their long tongue to eat the leaves. So, the trees release tannin to turn off the giraffe and it moves on when it has finished its meal,” he says.
Acacia auriculiformis, commonly known as auri or earleaf acacia is a fast-growing, crooked, gnarly tree in the family Fabaceae. The management now plans to plant the saplings in the enclosure using shield. “We are hoping we will be able to add some green fencing around it to prevent the giraffe from completely devouring on it,” the officer said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
One of the four imported giraffes — two pairs– had died in November 2019 shortly after its arrival from Africa while the second giraffe died in March last year — both due to peracute mortality syndrome, which affects giraffes during a season change, official statement from the Safari park had said. The third giraffe also died shortly after last year."

On May 6, Gujarat sent a request to the Centre to send in experts from Delhi and Mumbai to help it tackle coronavirus. Correspondingly, it put two of its largest cities, Ahmedabad and Surat, under total curfew, stopping everything except the supply of milk and medicines — the culmination of two months of a progressively worsening Covid-19 situation in the state.
Nearly two months after its first case on March 19, Gujarat has the most number of cases and deaths after Maharashtra, the second highest case fatality ratio in the country after West Bengal and, worryingly, a large proportion of the young among those dying. This is despite the fact that just 1% of the deaths in the state — which has a large diaspora — have been traced to infections from abroad.

Under pressure from the Centre, which named Gujarat and West Bengal as states of concern in a May 6 statement, the authorities have flapped about for answers: from patients reporting to hospitals late, to a different strain, to the Tablighi Jamaat (though only 14 of the 130 who returned to Gujarat from the Delhi gathering of the organisation, that developed into a cluster, tested positive, with one death).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

None of the reasons has stuck so far. Meanwhile, even as the Union Home Ministry attacks West Bengal for lack of transparency on coronavirus, starting May 5 (when it reported the highest single-day deaths, 49), the BJP-ruled Gujarat has stopped giving out age and co-morbidity details of its dead. Ahmedabad now also has a new team of officials in place — headed by Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta who helmed the Statue of Unity project — to handle the capital city’s coronavirus strategy.
THE TIMELINE
Gujarat, that began screening at airports in February, got its first Covid-19 case on March 19. By then, nearly half the states had already reported cases and the countrywide tally had crossed 100.

The first case was a 32-year-old Rajkot resident, who had returned from Umrah in Saudi Arabia. While he recovered quickly, Ahmedabad’s first patient, a 21-year-old who had returned from New York on March 14 and had only mild symptoms, took 32 days to get back home. The doctors said the longer recovery for the younger woman may have been due to the fact that she has asthma.
After the first two cases, the curve started climbing. While it took 17 days for the cases to cross 100 in the state, 90 new cases were reported on April 9 alone — 57 from Ahmedabad. The first death, that of a 62-year-old Surat businessman, happened within three days of the first case being reported.
Officials admit that while Gujarat had its guard up fast enough, testing was delayed. For a long time, a large number of samples were going to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai. The daily average even by mid-March was as little as 15 tests, going up to 200-odd by the end of the month. By April-end, when Delhi was testing 1,492 per million and Tamil Nadu 930 per million, Gujarat was testing 721 per million.

In a media interaction at the time, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said, “Certain states that have lower number (of cases) got clearance for laboratory tests earlier. Had we got clearance earlier, we might have been able to bring the situation under control.”

The state now has 24 laboratories conducting tests. With pool testing, the state is testing more than 5,500 samples a day.
But, Ahmedabad, comprising over 70% of Gujarat’s cases and deaths (4,991 of 7,013 cases; 321 of 425 deaths), is only doing 21% of its daily tests. In fact, testing actually fell in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) areas after April 23, when over 2,400 samples were tested in a 24-hour cycle — to about 1,300 as of May 1 and 1,072 by May 5.
A senior AMC official claims two primary reasons. “When we tested more than 2,400, we had the luxury of accommodating a number of positive patients in our hospitals. With each day, the capacity shrinks and thus we have to conduct tests in a staggered manner, while building more capacity.” The second reason, as per the official, is that the rise in cases also means reduced capacity for new samples. “For a patient to be discharged, we have to conduct at least three tests, as a result of which our on-field capacity reduces.”
That argument is difficult to digest given the state’s growing case fatality rate. At 59 per 1,000 confirmed cases, it is much higher than the national average (33 per 1,000) or even Maharashtra (38 per 1,000).
In contrast, Maharashtra (the state with the highest coronavirus tally) boosted its testing as cases and deaths rose.
THE DEATH PROFILE
April 23 saw the death of a 16-year-old from Dani Limda area, a hotspot in Ahmedabad. While the Covid-19 bulletin showed no co-morbidities in her case, Dr Jaiprakash V Modi, superintendent in charge of the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital where she died, told this paper that the teenager had autoimmune disease Lupus.

The following day, among the casualties was a 17-year-old from Behrampura, another hotspot in Ahmedabad. Again, the official note listed her as a Covid-19 death (with no co-morbidity). Her mother, who is quarantined with her two other children, told this paper she had no other conditions apart from a mental disability. “On April 22, she could not sleep the whole night. She couldn’t communicate and I failed to understand what was happening. The next day she had high fever. Within hours, she had difficulty breathing,” says the mother, who took her to the AMC-run Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) Hospital.

She says the doctors told her that her daughter was taking medicines for epilepsy. “But no doctor told us anything more. I never saw her have any epileptic fit,” says the mother, who couldn’t be present at the 17-year-old’s funeral. Deputy Municipal Commissioner Om Prakash Machra, who is overseeing operations at SVP, told The Sunday Express, “She had pre-existing conditions and had been on medication since birth.”
However, since then, the explanations have been harder coming. By April 30, 40 (nearly 18%) of 214 deaths in the state did not have any major underlying health condition. By May 6, this number stood at 109 (27% of 396 dead). Also, by then, 31 of the 319 dead (nearly 10%) were below 41 years.
Dr Atul Patel, an infectious diseases specialist who has been working with the state government on coronavirus, said last week, “Gujarat has a lot of patients even otherwise of blood pressure (hypertensive) as well as diabetes. With coronavirus, these conditions further deteriorate. A lot of patients come to the hospital after much delay, with barely any functionality of their lungs left, and we see them dying within six hours or so.”
THE LATE REPORTING
Among the dead is Behrampura corporator Badruddin Shaikh, 67, who succumbed on the 12th day of testing positive. His colleague, Jamalpur-Khadia Congress MLA Imran Khedawala, 53, was discharged on April 27, a day after Badruddin died.
The two are believed to have caught coronavirus while moving among Ahmedabad’s minority-dominated areas of Behrampura, Jamalpur and Dariapur, trying to convince people to come forward if they had symptoms. Of the AMC’s 4,649 cases until May 7, 1,587 or 34% had been reported from the Walled City areas, including Jamalpur, Shahpur, Dariapur and Khadia. The four wards comprise four of the 10 red zones.
Karnataka panel report: Late admission, age behind most deaths
Khedawala believes the in-built mistrust of government medical facilities among the minority-dominated areas is a reason for the late testing. Most of these areas are ghettos, where Muslims have been settling through successive communal riots, including 2002. An AMC official admits to lax presence here, both when it comes to sanitation and health.
The Tablighi connection, reiterated by CM Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel and practically every senior BJP leader, has only reinforced the distrust.

“I have been trying to tell the community to immediately see a doctor even at the slightest of symptoms. People pop medicines instead when they get fever or cough. They believe that if they go to a hospital, there is no coming back,” he says, adding that his case recovery should be a positive example.
Indore, which once had the highest fatality ratio among hotspots, managed to similarly turn the corner with positive reinforcements among its minority areas, from where many cases were reported (its fatality ratio is down from 15% to under 5%). In Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, the authorities changed the protocol to home quarantine for those asymptomatic, to establish trust. In Maharashtra, an outreach has been started in Urdu.
Deputy Municipal Commissioner Machra gives the example of a 35-year-old man from Jamalpur who died on April 29. “While there was no co-morbidity, the patient got himself tested six days after the onset of symptoms,” Machra says, adding he was serious by the time he was admitted. However, he reiterates that most deaths are of patients with underlying conditions, some of whom may have been unaware of the same till admission.
Another patient, a 66-year-old retired bank employee living in the Shah-e-Alam area, did not report to a doctor till three days after he developed fever followed by cough and chest pain. Though he also had hypertension and diabetes, his 39-year-old son did not report the coronavirus-like symptoms when he took him to a local doctor. He died five minutes after he was taken to hospital on April 29.

The son says his father eagerly followed Covid-19 news and hence was well aware of the symptoms, but “did not go to a doctor fearing the family would get into trouble”.

Says Khedawala: “I got tested to create a sense of trust towards authorities… (But) the kind of atmosphere being created will not help. This might lead to a grave situation.”
Former BJP MLA Bhushan Bhatt, for example, has a clear logic about why Khadia, a Hindu pocket in the containment zone in Ahmedabad Walled City, has 440-odd cases (as on May 7). “The biggest mistake we made was to not restrict movement from and to Khadia,” he says.
Machra says people from lower-income groups also do not come in for testing, fearing loss of income if quarantined. It is difficult to convince them, especially if they remain asymptomatic, the AMC official adds.
Some patients from Khokra area in Ahmedabad, admitted at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, say as much. Natwarbhai Dabhi, 45, told The Sunday Express, “We are vegetable sellers, we were just randomly picked up. Why this injustice? They told 24 of us are positive, but we don’t even have fever.”
Even as the vendors blame buyers, “who have cars so they never test positive”, the AMC has termed the vendors “super spreaders”. Nearly 14,000 of them are to be tested and accordingly given “health cards”.
AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, among the experts called by the state from the Centre, toured hospitals in Ahmedabad on Saturday. He too attributed the reasons for the state’s high mortality to the stigma attached to the disease. “There is still fear,” said Dr Guleria, adding how a person can be mildly symptomatic but still have critically low oxygen levels in the blood (a phenomenon known as happy hypoxia).
Now, establishments run by Muslim-majority trusts have offered spaces for Covid-19 facilities to bridge the gap. The first such establishment, Haj House in Walled City, saw a welcome response, as many observing Ramzan see it as a more acceptable space.
THE DISEASE
Dr Rajesh Mishra, a critical care specialist based in Ahmedabad, says that as a disease, Covid-19 is difficult to detect in early stages. It directly attacks the lung, without necessarily showing up in the upper respiratory tract. “Data shows that 40% of the time a test may be negative. That is why, in suspect cases, in the third or fourth attempt, a person may test positive,” Dr Mishra says.
He calls for detecting low oxygen levels in blood through markers. “Accordingly patients can be put on blood-thinning and anti-inflammatory drugs… If we start this early, it improves the chances of a patient.” A clinical trial along these lines, the WHO Solidarity trial, which includes comparative study of administering a cocktail of drugs vs standard care, is underway at BJ Medical College.
Dr Atul Patel of Sterling Hospital, among the three designated hospitals for treating Covid-19 in Ahmedabad, has suggested that Gujarat might be seeing the “more virulent” ‘L-strain’ of coronavirus, as seen in China, than the ‘S-strain’. However, there is little consensus on this, with the ICMR, as well as Dr M M Vegad, Head of Microbiology at B J Medical College, saying there is no evidence to support such a hypothesis.
Principal Secretary, Gujarat Health and Family Welfare Department, Jayanti Ravi, said that with nearly 80% of coronavirus cases asymptomatic and another 15% mildly or moderately symptomatic, their focus are “the nearly 5% who come in as critical patients”. “It is not possible to test all the six crore population of the state, but the main thing is proper surveillance. Cases are expected to increase,” she says, while talking of “growing herd immunity”.
An AMC official says that more than the deaths, what is of concern to them are “preventable deaths”. “In a city of 80 lakh, even if less than 1% or around 80,000 are critical, we won’t be able to handle it. This is an issue with the health system everywhere. So the approach is to slow down or stagger the disease, create a system of rotation in place.”
That is the reason the government has worked out home isolation for people with mild symptoms now.
THE CURFEW
Apart from putting Ahmedabad and Surat under total lockdown, the Gujarat government has pressed in the BSF and CISF to patrol containment zones. Amidst talk of the Centre being unhappy, a Gujarat government statement pointed out that the Inter Ministerial Central Team sent to the two cities was “satisfied” with what it saw. “The team expressed satisfaction at the administration’s alertness and success in detection of patients owing to large-scale testing from the very beginning,” the statement said.
On Saturday, Ahmedabad began a massive sanitation campaign, involving retrofitted fire-tending vehicles, drones and other equipment.
Gujarat, meanwhile, can already see a silver living: by May 5, the doubling rate was up to 12.6 from six days.
The many course changes in Bengal
Even given the bitterness between West Bengal and the Centre, few might have expected it to spill over into the efforts against coronavirus. Now the numbers seem stacked against the Mamata Banerjee government: between 9.75% (the state’s estimation) and 13.2% (the Centre’s), the state has the highest mortality rate in the country.
THE TIMELINE
There have been problems from the start. The first case, on March 18, was the son of a state government officer who returned from London, tested positive, and was allowed to roam around Kolkata for two days before finally getting himself admitted to a hospital. The first death followed seven days later, of a 57-year-old from Dumdum.

Within days, the state became the first in the country to set up a “death audit committee”, which would certify whether casualties could be attributed to the virus or not. This stirred accusations of fudged numbers. Exactly a month later, the gap stood stark when Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha gave out the first numbers, saying that while there had been 57 deaths of people “with” Covid-19 in the state, it considered only 18 “due to” Covid-19.
Incidentally, with deaths rising, several states have now started making that distinction — including the badly hit Mumbai — while West Bengal has itself virtually disbanded the audit committee under pressure from the Centre. Addressing media persons on April 29, CM Mamata Banerjee said, “We have to correct ourselves because we make mistakes. I do not know everything as I am no expert.” On May 4, the Chief Secretary said the administration had found “missing data” and acknowledged gaps in numbers.
Consequently, the rise of cases in Bengal has been swift. On May 7, the number stood at 1,548, with 151 deaths. West Bengal has also amended its health bulletin to go back to original — reporting again total number of cases rather than just “active positive cases”.
THE TESTING
On April 21, the Union Home Ministry sent two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams to the state, to check on its Covid-19 efforts. Almost overnight, the state made another course change — from 400-450 tests per day, to 2,500. West Bengal has said it couldn’t ramp up testing earlier due to unavailability of kits from the Centre. It is yet to start random testing. A state official said: “Initially, the Centre did not supply sufficient kits, now we have procured these from the market.”
Says Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Shantanu Sen, a doctor himself, “We never tried to suppress any data. The Centre was not prepared enough… Now, they are blaming states.”
However, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases director, Shanta Dutta, had earlier told The Indian Express, “We have enough kits… We would welcome more samples for testing.”
In a letter to the state on May 6, after the IMCTs submitted their final report, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said, “The response to Covid-19 in West Bengal is characterized by very low rate of testing in proportion to the population…. ”
Among those who accuse the state government of “late response” are doctors’ organisations, who have alleged severe shortage of protective equipment. Health workers account for more than hundred positive cases in the state. Says the secretary, Association of Health Service Doctors, Manas Gumta, “The lockdown gave time to prepare. But the government did nothing.”
THE DEATH PROFILE
The perceived reluctance to share data also extends to deaths, be it age or co-morbidity details. In his first remarks on the matter after announcement of the Central teams, Chief Secretary Sinha said, “Maximum persons who died were old. So, we are suggesting older people should stay at home….” Later, he advised a uniform format for death certificates, with “the immediate cause of death, antecedent cause of death and underlying cause of death”.
In its first report, before it clammed up, the death audit committee mentioned several co-morbidities, such as cardiomiopathy with chronic kidney disease, renal failure, as well as heart conditions and hypertension.
The case of a 70-year-old woman, a patient of a lung disease, is symptomatic of the dearth of details. Her son says she fell ill on April 24, and the next morning, he took her to a private hospital, which denied her admission and referred her to state-run NRS Medical College Hospital. According to him, when both NRS and state-run SSKM Hospital turned them away, they returned home. “Next morning (April 26), my mother’s oxygen level dipped. I could not get an ambulance till 5 pm. With the help of friends, I shifted her to NRS.” After initial treatment, the authorities asked them to take her to MR Bangur Hospital as they lacked necessary equipment.
“We took her there. However, the on-duty doctor said they did not have the required medicines or instruments. He suggested we shift her to NRS again,” he says. This time she was admitted to an isolation ward at NRS Hospital; the son says he had to carry her himself. When he returned in the evening to visit her, he was told she had died and that they would do a Covid-19 test. On April 28, the Health Department called to say his mother had tested positive and that the family should stay in 14-day quarantine and also get tested. He, however, says no one “from the government come to get our samples”. On May 2, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation called to tell him his mother had been cremated on April 29. He says the saga continued and, on May 6, he got a call from the Health Department, asking, “How is your mother now?”
NRS Hospital Superintendent Tarun Kumar Pathak says, “If a patient dies, we cannot do anything. The family can approach the Health Department. But if a family submits any complaint to us, we can look into the matter.”
THE MEASURES
Since the arrival of the Central team, the state has not only brought in major changes in management of the Covid-19 but also stricter lockdown especially in containment zones. From April 7 to May 3, the state claims to have surveyed 5.57 crore households for severe acute respiratory illnesses and influenza like illnesses, and identified 872 and 91,515 respectively."

The work will involve studying the seismic activity and the possibility of large earthquakes striking these cities.
The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences has awarded the work to Gandhinagar-based ISR which has been doing similar work in Gujarat.
“For this work, ISR has won the bid ahead of the various IITs like IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Kharagpur, IIT-Rourkee and IISc Bangalore. We have selected for all the eight cities namely Amritsar, Varanasi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Meerut, Patna and Dhanbad. An agreement has been signed with the Ministry earlier this week,” said Dr Sumer Chopra, officiating director general of ISR, an establishment fully dedicated to earthquake studies.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We will be starting this work next month. It will take almost 2-3 years to complete. This is a manpower intensive work where we have to carry out geotechnical, geophysical and geological surveys in the whole city in a grid-pattern. Then we will prepare seismic microzonation maps which will provide data regarding the seismic activity in and around the city. We will study active faults passing through or near a city and try to establish the maximum intensity of earthquakes that might strike the city or a region near it ,” Dr Chopra told The Indian Express.
According to ISR, these maps will also help in designing buildings or infrastructure, in tune with the seismic activity in the region.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
According to experts, cities in the Indo-Gangetic belt and regions like Gujarat are prone to severe to very severe earthquakes. In the recent past, ISR has prepared seismic microzonation maps for several cities in Gujarat including Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Bhuj, Gandhidham, Kandla, all of which were adversely impacted by the 2001 Kutch earthquake. Similar maps have also been prepared for large projects like GIFT City, Statue of Unity at Kevadia, Dholera Special Investment Region, Mundra LPG terminal and the 30000 MW solar plant in Kutch."

Addressing NRIs living in 20 cities of the US via video-conference,Modi gave a call to restore peoples trust in the institutions of the country. His address was part of Gujarat Day celebrations. Going by the incidents of the past one month,we can understand how much damage a weak government can do, Modi said.
In his hour-long speech,he also lashed out at the UPA government for its weak foreign policy. The External Affairs Minister (in an apparent reference to former external affairs minister S M Krishna) of my country,while addressing an international forum,takes some other countrys papers and starts reading.

Modi also slammed the UPA government for alleged corruption. One has rarely seen such loathsome corruption. Even coal has not been spared, he said. We have to restore peoples trust. We need trust in leaders,in parties,in policies, Modi said.
Hardselling his Gujarat model of development,he said the state had become a prominent place on the tourism map of India. 
Concluding his speech,Modi sought contributions from the Indian diaspora for building the Statue of Unity near the Sardar Sarovar dam site,which will be a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He said the statue would be double the height of Statue of Liberty in New York."

During his visit to the Statue of Unity Friday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called it “modern India’s pilgrimage”. The first among chief ministers to visit the site in Kevadiya Colony in Narmada district, Adityanath, who was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, also visited the Valley of Flowers, Tent City and Sardar Sarovar Dam site at the integrated complex of the statue.
The 182-metre tall Statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Addressing mediapersons, Adityanath said, “This is a marvel. It stands up to the stature of what Sardar Patel symbolizes. There couldn’t have been a better tribute for mother India’s great son (Sardar Patel). Sardar Patel unified India and this Statue with its motto of ‘Ek bharat, shreshta bharat’ only enhances his vision.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his projects and said, “First as the Chief Minister and now as the Prime Minister, he has made his contributions to the state with the dam to provide clean water for drinking and for irrigation to all the farmers and now the statue of Unity that will boost tourism.”
“There are many religious pilgrimage sites in India, but this will be modern India’s pilgrimage. The way it has been developed has left me awestruck. The way that guides have been educated and involved is worth the appreciation,” he said.
He further stated that the UP government has already agreed upon setting up a UP tourism bhavan close to the site of the statue. “We have already sent a proposal to the Gujarat Government to set up a tourism bhavan and we are keen on setting it up as soon as possible,” he said.
During his tour of the site, Adityanath refused to answer a media query on building a Ram temple in Ayodhya.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

According to government sources, while President Ram Nath Kovind is expected to visit the statue on December 15, the dates for the visit of CMs from other states are yet to be finalised."

The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has recommended the Gujarat government to give land for land to tribals, in cases where their land is to be acquired for developing a tourism zone around the Statue of Unity in Narmada district. The Commission, however, could not speak with the tribals of the district likely to be affected by the proposed land acquisition, since nobody from the community came forward to meet it.
The Commission said this on Friday, while interacting with media persons after its four-day visit to Gujarat and a meeting with top officials of the state government.
The state government is facing resistance from tribals of various villages around SoU, where it is planning a massive tourism zone. Recently, acting on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) moved by an Ahmedabad-based environment activist, the Gujarat High Court had ordered to maintain status quo on the land acquisition process in those villages.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Asked if the Commission raised the issue with the state government, Commission Chairperson Nandkumar Sai said, “We did not meet the locals there, but we did have a conversation with local officials. For the tourism plan which is being designed there, land should be given in lieu of land and the planning should be done accordingly.”
Sai added that the government has put forward its side but, “We have said (to the state government) that the attempt should be such that they get land for land, tribals want land for land.”
Another member of the Commission, Harshad Vasava said that during its one-day visit to Narmada district, the Commission had also visited some of the local villages and tried to reach out its tribals, “but nobody came forward to meet the Commission chairman.”
Vasava added that they had telephonic talks with some local tribal groups to have a meeting. “After initially showing readiness to meet, none of them came to meet the Commission, eventually,” he added.
Meanwhile, summing up the Commission’s visit to Gujarat, Sai said that they were quite impressed by the Gujarat government’s work to ensure that a 100 per cent of medical seats reserved for tribals are filled. Calling this an ‘achievement’ of the state government, Sai added that the Commission was considering to prepare a report to be submitted to the President, so that the same may be replicated in other states.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The Commission has also emphasized on a need for research to find a cure to Sickle-cell anemia, which is quite prevalent among tribals in Gujarat."

The event will be organised by the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Memorial Society,chaired by  Union Minister of State for Mines Dinsha Patel,who invited the Prime Minister to inaugurate it.
Senior Congress leader Jawahar Upadhyay said that Modi had also been invited to the event. Keshubhai Patel,who is also a member of the society,has also been invited. Dinsha Patel had met Modi and invited him to the function. The invitation card of the function says that the PM will be the chief guest and Modi the special guest. The Sardar memorial has been renovated at Rs 19 crore.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile,Modi will lay the foundation stone of the Rs 2,000-crore Statue of Unity project at the exotic Kevadiya Colony on an island opposite the Sardar Sarovar Dam. About 20,000 farmers from across India are expected to participate. Besides,1 lakh farmers from Gujarat will also take out a rally near the venue before the foundation-laying ceremony. Modi has also invited his critic  and Union Minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Jairam Ramesh to the event. It will be organised under the aegis of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,headed by Modi.
Modi is trying hard to bring the farmer lobby comprising Patels on his side by launching a movement to collect iron for making the statue. The politically powerful Patel community influences more than 20 Assembly seats in Gujarat. Most of them are aligned with the BJP already. As the Gujarat government machinery moves to mobilise this collection,it will also help the BJP mobilise farmers across the country.
Gordhan Zadaphia,a Patel leader who quit the BJP to join former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patels Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP),complains that the Congress in the state has woken up very late to honour Sardar Patel. He also criticises Modi of  politicising Sardar Patel. Narendra Modi is asking for pieces of iron from farmers. It is not intended to raise the status of Sardar Patel,but to garner votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, he says. Poor farmers are being terrorised to vacate their land for Sardar Patels statue. This is not living up to Sardars ideals, he said. The Bhartiya Kisan Sangh,which has openly and fiercely opposed Modi for years,has come out in support of Modi for this project.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Addressing the crowd,Modi said while flagging off over 70 trucks with banners of his and Sardar Patels pictures,It (iron collection drive) is as big and organised as the elections in the country. These resource kits can also be tracked. 
Each of the corrugated boxes to bring back the iron tool has a letter to the sarpanch signed by Modi,a bottle to collect soil,posters,booklets,VCD about Sardar Patel,pens and is embedded with a GPS chip to help track it.
Soil from every village and the used farm iron will be placed in these resource kit boxes and will be transported back to the proposed State of Unity site in Gujarat. The soil will not be picked from anywhere in the village. It will be taken from schools,temples,mosques,mazaars (mausoleums),churches,gurudwaras and memorials of matryrs in the village, Modi said.
The banners saying Indias future prime minister… we welcome you with all our heart, were put up by the local corporator and the BJP MLA.
Even the arch on the main gate constructed for the event said the same thing. Describing Sardar Patel as a symbol of unity,Modi said,If it was not for Sardar Patel,it would have taken a visa to go to Junagadh (a district in Gujarat).

The conference, organised on the theme ‘Harmonious coordination between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary — Key to a vibrant democracy’, and will see discussions on ways to ensure constitutional accountability of the legislature and the executive to the people. It will also take up issues related to working of the state legislatures in a disciplined and orderly fashion. The event, also known as the Speakers’ Conference, will end on the Constitution Day (November 26) with a virtual address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“The two-day conference will begin tomorrow on the banks of River Narmada and near the Statue of Unity. This tradition of organising the conference dates back to 1921,” Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla told reporters at Gandhinagar on Tuesday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Birla is also the chairperson of the conference, which is in its centenary year now.
Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu will also attend the conference along with dignitaries like Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Birla said. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi and presiding officers of various legislative bodies from across the country are expected to attend the conference.
An official communique on the event said as many as 27 presiding officers of state legislative bodies have confirmed their participation. Secretaries of state legislatures and other senior officials are also expected to join, said the release on the event.
Asked why the event, where more than 400 people are expected to gather, was being held at Kevadiya when the Covid-19 situation in Gujarat was deteriorating, Birla said, “We conducted parliamentary proceedings in between the Covid-19 pandemic. We conducted the proceedings for more time and the productivity was 167 per cent. It becomes our duty to tell the nation that our duties come first… I want to thank the Presiding Officers for abiding by their constitutional responsibilities during such perilous times and all of them have come here.”
Birla also said meetings of the 54 Parliamentary Committees were continuously being held while adhering to social-distancing norms and as per the SoPs (standard operating procedures) of the government. “We have to do our duties for the sake of the country,” he said.
Post-Diwali, the daily number of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat jumped from 926 cases (as recorded on November 16) to 1,427 fresh cases on Monday. The number of cases in the tribal district of Tapi, where the conference is being held, has also seen a surge from just one case a day to 10 cases on Monday. On Monday, the state government restricted gatherings for weddings to 100 people to control the spread of the virus.
Gujarat last hosted the conference in January 2016, when a four-day-long event was held at Gandhinagar. The state had earlier hosted the event in 1973 and 1992. In 2019, the Speakers’ Conference was held in Uttarakhand, where anti-defection law, building a common digital platform for viewing parliamentary proceedings and ways to smoothly conduct the proceedings of Houses were discussed."

The Gujarat government’s ambitious ‘Statue of Unity’ project now faces a legal hurdle as a group of activists from Gujarat has moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT), demanding a stay on the construction of the project, claiming that it does not have environmental clearance.
The construction for the 180-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on an island in the middle of Narmada river started November last year.
A group of ten activists from Gujarat have moved the Western Bench of NGT situated in Pune through lawyers Aseem Sarode and Alka Babaladi, pleading that the project was “illegal” as it has failed to take the required clearance.
[related-post]https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
They have demanded that no further construction at the site be allowed till the permission is granted.
A bench of justices V R Kingaonkar and expert member Ajay Deshpande admitted the petition and, after hearing the counsel of applicants, issued notice to the respondents asking for their say in the matter. Among the respondents are Chairman, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), Chairman, Managing Director, SSNNL, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Larsen & Toubro Limited, and Secretary, Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
In the petition, the activists claim that despite repeated communications with the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), the body or the state government did not furnish any information pertaining to the clearances taken by the project. However, in a response to an RTI application in July 2014, the SSNNL said that the project did not require environment clearance, therefore, the environment impact assessment and social impact assessment need not be carried out for the the project.
“Environment clearance is required for the Statue of Unity Project. The project includes the principal statue, to be constructed over 20,000 square metres of area and Shreshtha Bharat Bhawan to be constructed over 1,00,000 sq metres of area. Therefore, the activity area of the project is much higher than the threshold of 20,000 sq metres prescribed under the schedule to the Environmental Impact Assessment, Notification 2006. SSNNL does not have any authority to decide by itself if the project requires environmental clearance or not,” reads the petition.
As per the petition, clearance is also required for the Statue of Unity as it is within 10-km distance of the Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary, which is notified under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
“The project also requires construction on a massive scale on the river bed of River Narmada. The project is being constructed on the wetlands of River Narmada. Allowing the project to continue will result in irreversible damage to the wetlands of River Narmada which are sought to be protected by the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010,” reads the petition, adding that despite all these threats, there has been no environment impact assessment or social impact assessment done.Pune NewsClear sky conditions, heat to return over Pune: IMD‘My father could not get a ventilator bed for 10 hours in Pune city,’ says late activist’s sonCovid norms: PCMC bars ‘guests’ in cooperative housing societies, violators to face Rs 10,000 fineClick here for more
“This construction is bound to result in damage to the downstream river, its biodiversity, the people living downstream and their livelihoods. Further, the project is going to result in displacement of people from many villages, including that of tribals,” advocate Sarode said. The case will be heard next month."

Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, who was in Kevadia colony on Saturday, said that it would grow into a Rs 1 lakh-crore economy due to its potential for tourism.
Goyal was assessing the ongoing project of connecting Kevadia colony to the main railway line at Dabhoi. He met Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to discuss the development of Railways in the state and urged land owners on the Dabhoi-Kevadia route to part with their lands and allow for the development to continue in full swing.
Flanked by state Energy Minister Saurabh Patel, Goyal said, “I am requesting land owners with folded hands to allow us to acquire the lands so that the work on the railway line connecting Kevadia to Chandod and Dabhoi, and thereafter to the mainline in Vadodara, can be completed. It will pave way for tourists from across the country to visit Kevadia and change the fortune of this place.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Goyal expressed confidence that the Railway Ministry will be able to acquire the land for the project by March and that work on the entire stretch will be completed soon.
“The potential that Kevadia holds as a tourist destination is immense. It has world class facilities which many other sites across the globe haven’t been able to provide. I am told that as many has 35,000 tourists have visited the Statue of Unity on a single day during festivals and holidays, since its inauguration just over a year ago. I am sure once the connectivity with the Railways is complete, this figure will go up to one lakh per day,” Goyal added.
“If I can make a small prediction, Kevadia will generate a revenue from tourism such that it will become a one lakh-crore economy place. It was the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create the statue to pay a tribute to the Iron Man of India. The place gives anyone visiting here an inspiration and makes the younger generation aware about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” he said.
Goyal also discussed possible expediting of railway projects in the state, mainly centred on the Statue of Unity connectivity, with Rupani. A government release stated that Rupani apprised Goyal about the land acquisition for the Dabhoi-Kevadia route, as well as the ongoing work on the Kevadia Railway station.
The CM is also said to have informed Goyal about the progress of work on the conversion of the narrow gauge to broad gauge on this route, as well as on the work order issued for the Katosan Road-Becharaji railway line by the Gujarat Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation, for Rs 266 crore."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is expected to walk the last leg of the Gujarat Pradesh Youth Congress’s (GPYC) “Vikas Khoj Padyatra”’ and address a public meeting on the concluding day of the event at Bardoli in south Gujarat on February 8.

The event is being seen as a counter to BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi’s campaign to build the Statue of Unity on the Narmada river.
Vallabhbhai Patel, who led the famous Bardoli Kisan Satyagraha in 1928, an example of non-violent struggle on Gandhian principles, went on to win him title of ‘Sardar’ from here. Modi is leading a campaign to collect iron from farmers across the country to build the Statue of Unity, the proposed 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel, which is to be the tallest in the world, in the tribal Narmada district.
Rahul Gandhi’s meeting is also expected to mobilise youth workers of the party as also the tribals in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections slated for April/May this year.  The last time Gandhi participated in a padyatra in Gujarat was during the re-enactment of the Dandi march to commemorate its 75 years in 2005, soon after UPA-1 came to power in 2004.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As the party leaders say, the focus of the party is on the youth. Generally speaking, the party is concentrating its efforts in mobilising people in the age group of 20-40 years, who account for over 50 per cent of  the voters in the country as well as Gujarat.

Party sources said that after landing in Surat, Gandhi will join the padyatris for a distance of about 5 km from Putwada village in Mahuva taluka of Surat district to Bardoli via Vadod and Delwada. Besides state party leaders, he will be accompanied by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president Rajiv Satav.
Party leaders said the padyatra was being organised under directions of Rahul Gandhi himself. A similar padyatra was organised last month in Kerala, the concluding programme of which was addressed by Rahul Gandhi as well.
State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said Bardoli had been chosen for the concluding event because of its significance in the country’s freedom struggle. It was here that tribal leaders initiated a movement in 1928, after the then British government refused to reduce the tax on land in spite of the severe droughts that hit the area. They later invited Vallabh bhai Patel and their movement turned into a success.
Doshi said that on February 8, the youth Congress leaders and Rahul Gandhi will focus particularly on the BJP government’s failure to bring about any concrete development in the state.  The padyatra have so far been addressed by several Central party leaders including Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel, former cricketer and MP from Moradabad MohammedAhmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Azharuddin and Union Minister of State for Power Jyotiraditya Scindia. State youth Congress leader Nagendra Rathod said that padyatris were moving from village to village, from door to door to inform people of the party’s policies regarding the rural poor.

The padyatra that started from Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad on January 18, will cover a distance of 500 km across seven Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly constituencies in central and south Gujarat regions."

(File)
Hours after the inauguration of a Rs 3,000-crore statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat, BSP president Mayawati demanded an apology from those who had flayed her over the statues of Dalit leaders her government had installed in Uttar Pradesh.
“All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj, for terming the statues installed by the then BSP government to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,” she said in a statement.
“The people of the country are also wondering if all this is not politics, and if the BJP really had this love for Patel why had they not put up such a massive statue earlier in Gujarat where they are in power for a long time,” she said. The Bahujan Samaj Party chief paid tributes to Vallabhbhai Patel, known as the ‘Iron man of India’, on his 143rd birth anniversary.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
She said like Dalit leader Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel was also a nationalist and was widely respected. Mayawati questioned, “the politics and faith” behind the English nomenclature of the statue of the country’s first home minister, who she said was an example of Indian culture and traditions.
The 182-metre ‘Statue of Unity’ is the world’s tallest, about twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US. The former UP chief minister said the “foreign stamp” on the construction of Patel’s statue will always trouble Patel’s followers.
She accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and its government at the Centre of confining Patel to a region, saying this is an example of BJP’s “narrow-mindedness”. The statue was dedicated to the nation on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat’s Kevadiya. It is built on Sadhu Bet islet near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Narmada district.Lucknow NewsVoting for UP panchayat polls beginsNames of BSP govt projects being changed due to casteist prejudice: MayawatiGovt working on Ambedkar’s principles to ensure benefits to all without discrimination: Yogi AdityanathClick here for more
Modi slammed those criticising the decision to build the monument, questioning whether any crime had been committed by constructing such memorials for national heroes like Patel. Patel, the country’s first home minister, is credited with merging over 500 princely states into the Union of India."

The crowd-funding initiative was launched from the same venue from where the Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel, minutes earlier, inaugurated a sound-and-light show, based on anecdotes from the life of the “Iron Man of India”. The 25-minute-long audiovisual film shown as part of the programme on two screens erected alongside a newly built replica of Patel’s statue ended with a photograph of him holding a lotus. As laser beams fell on the statue at Swarnim Park in Gandhinagar, it changed from tricolour to saffron.
The audio-visual film opens depicting a fictional scene that would have prevailed in and around 1947 when India became independent. The narrative talks about chaos and indecision that prevailed among princely states during the period of partition when they had to opt between India and a newly formed Pakistan. Trying to impress upon the audience of how Indians would have been seeking visas to visit neighbouring states, the narrative also goes on to show how India would have been “islands” consisting of 562 princely states had it not been for the efforts of Sardar Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The film, interspersed with visuals from history depicting Sardar Patel in the company of Gandhi and Nehru, depicts stories of bravery from his childhood and sacrifices as he grows up to leave his job as a barrister and dedicates himself to the service of the nation. The film also talks about how “Mahabat Khan, the Nawab of Junagadh” — a princely state located on south-western end of Gujarat that acceded to Pakistan — fled to the neighbouring country as the people of Junagadh voted to remain with India.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
As the film recounts the leader’s contribution to various movements organised in the pre-Indepenedce India, Patel, towards the end is shown holding a lotus. Almost at the same time, the colour of his statue changes from tricolour to saffron."

During the meeting, chief minister also discussed various projects in the state including the Sardar Sarovar project, Statue of Unity and Dahej-Ghogha Ferry service.
The Chinese Ambassador’s visit to Gujarat coincides with Wednesday’s “in-principle approval” of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between India and China for setting up industrial parks in the country. Both sides had identified five states — Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka — where the parks would be set up
“This was a long pending demand to strengthen India China trade and investment ties which has now been fulfilled by the new government. In return the Chinese Government may agree to allow India to set up industrial parks there in China” Jagat Shah, interim Secretary General of CITIC (China-India Trade and Investment Centre).
Chinese companies like TBEA Energy (India) Pvt Ltd and Hongkong-based CLP Group is already present in Gujarat. “There are currently about 20 Chinese companies in Gujarat. Most of these companies are into transformers, electronics, cotton & yarn sectors. According to Indo-China Chamber of Commerce an estimated 100 more Chinese firms are waiting to invest in the state. Sanand, near Ahmedabad is a major attraction for the Chinese firms,” said Bhagyesh Soneji, chairperson of ASSOCHAM.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

SSNNL MD S Jagdeeshan,who was part of the SSCAC meeting,said tenders will be floated soon for the construction of the 1,100 metres long and 31.75 metres high weir. 
The proposed weir,costing about Rs 400 crore,will store one Million Acre Feet (MAF) water,one-fourth of the Narmada Dams capacity,while water from the weir will be pumped back into the dam and then again sent through turbines to generate power.

Jagdeeshan said,The weir will facilitate production of power during peak hours with the help of reversible turbines at the dam. SSCAC officials said the pump-back power generation is economical only during peak hours,when the cost of power available from the Central Power Grid is much higher than the cost of generating power through pump-back technology."

Gujarat’s Energy Minister Saurabh Patel on Tuesday sought to allay fears of hindi speaking migrants in the wake of recent hate attacks on them and assured people of Bihar that they should feel “100 per cent” safe in the western state.
Patel is on a three-day visit to Patna to invite Bihar Governor Lalji Tandon, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and people of the state to visit the ‘statue of unity’ of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, being dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Oct 31 on Sardar’s birth anniversary.
The Gujarat minister blamed Congress legislator Alpesh Thakor for the attacks on migrants and said they were “political in nature”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rape of a minor girl allegedly by a person hailing from Bihar recently had triggered attacks on migrants particularly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh across Gujarat resulting in their flight back home from there out of fear.
“It (attacks) were political in nature… I am not only extending invitation to the people of Bihar but also giving assurance to them that they should feel 100 per cent safe (in Gujarat),” Patel told reporters here.
“There is no need to be concerned for the safety of people of Bihar living in Gujarat… People of all states have contributed to the development of Gujarat ever since it was created in 1960… People from north Indian states, Bihar and Odisa have also contributed a lot,” he said.
“Peace that has prevailed since 1960 among Gujarati and non-Gujarati (people) will continue,” he added highlighting that Gujarat’s two top officials– the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police (DGP)– were from Bihar.
The energy minister further asked Bihar Congress leaders why they were promoting an “anti-national” like Thakor who was disturbing the peace in Gujarat.
Thakor is an All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge for Bihar.
Speaking about his meetings with Nitish Kumar, Sushil Kumar Modi and the Bihar Governor, Patel said an invitation was extended on behalf of Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and the dignitaries can visit the state after November 1 as per their convenience.
Sardar’s statue of unity is 182-metre high, which is the world’s tallest statue built at a cost of Rs 2,332 crore, he said, adding that 70,000 metric tonnes of cement, 18,500 reinforcement metric tonnes of steel, 6,000 metric tonnes of structural steel and 1700 metric tonnes of bronze was used in the construction.
The project is the brainchild and life-time dream of the prime minister who laid the foundation stone of the project in 2013 when he was the Gujarat Chief Minister, Patel said.
“It was a long pending desire of PM Narendra Modi to commemorate the life and work of Sardar Patel in such a manner that it continues to inspire Indians in the current generation and in the future,” Patel said.
The governments which came to power after Independence only gave credit to the Nehru family and the prime minister wanted to give Sardar Patel his due, the minister said, adding that soil collected from across the country was used to build the foundation of the statue."

(File)
The Statue of Unity (SoU) site in Kevadia village is in the spotlight again, after the Gujarat government tightened vigil around it to prevent villagers from protesting by farming on land acquired by it for building various infrastructure to boost tourism.
On June 17, the Narmada district administration formed five teams to keep vigil on the acquired farmlands in six villages around the SoU recently fenced by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL). Since then, four cases of trespassing have been registered against villagers in Gora, Navagam and Limdi.
The villages that protested in May and June when SSNNL began fencing the land after the Gujarat High Court dismissed their petitions, include Vaghadiya, Kevadia and Kothi.
The backgroundhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Gujarat government originally acquired the land in 1961, for the construction of the Narmada dam canal and subsequently transferred possession to SSNNL, a wholly-owned Gujarat government public limited company, incorporated in March 1989 to execute and manage the Sardar Sarovar Dam project.
SSNNL was part of the trust that built the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the government of Gujarat and continues to manage the structure. In 2019, the Gujarat government cleared a bill to set up a Statue of Unity Area Development Authority to help expedite projects in the area that is predominantly tribal.
Although the SSNNL has almost completed the fencing of the land, about 250 original landholders and their heirs are yet to accept the compensation offered by the SSNNL.
General Manager (Technical & Co-ordination) of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) MB Joshi, said, “A significant time has passed and the younger generation may not even know the facts of the compensation awarded to their forefathers. We cannot consider the third or fourth generations of the landholders as beneficiaries… We are willing to discuss the compensation and take their suggestions.”
What villagers argue
The villagers of Limdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora say that the government acquired the land 59 years ago to build the Sardar Sarovar dam but is now intending to put the land to use for other commercial purposes and hence the SSNNL claim on the land should be invalidated.
They have been backed by the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) founded by Chhotu Vasava who has also called it the ‘Statue of Displacement’ and the Congress which also staged a demonstration against the police detaining protesting tribals.
The six villages filed a PIL in the Gujarat High Court protesting the acquisition and calling the compensation offered “meagre”. The HC dismissed their petition in May, after which the SSNNL began fencing the land.
After several incidents of trespassing, the police pitched a tent on one of the hillocks for a commanding vigil of the area. On June 25, a group of women from Kevadia village led by a villager Leela Tadvi, took over the tent and declared that they would not move till the police removed it.
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadia, Vani Doodhat, clarified that the tent was only for a panoramic view of the area as “there is sensitive installation with Narmada dam and Statue of Unity” and that it was not for “vigil on their land”.
Deputy Collector and Administrator of Kevadia, Nikunj Parikh says he is duty-bound to protect the land acquired by SSNNL as the administrator of Kevadia. “This will be a continuous exercise because no one can farm in the government land. We will take legal action against trespassers,” he says.
Predominantly a population of Tadvi tribals, two of the six villages, Kevadia and Vagadiya, are bitter about being called “illegal occupants” on their own farmlands. The land acquired from both these villages faces the main road and is in close proximity to the SoU where hotels and resorts are coming up.
What SSNNL says
In its reply to the High Court, SSNNL said that the government acquired physical possession of land in five villages, measuring 1814.65 acres, and paid compensation packages. But since the lands were not utilised, the villagers returned to their lands and subsequently the original landholders died.
According to SSNNL, as per the Narmada Waters Dispute Tribunal (NWDT) Award of 1979, the six villages had 238 landholders, of which about 105 original landholders are yet to agree upon the compensation package. Similarly, 241 men, sons of the original landholders, were counted as beneficiaries and of these, about 120 are yet to accept the compensation.
Compensation package
As per the guidelines of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA), male heirs of a landholder, displaced due to the project, who are 18 years of age as of November 1 1989, are to be given land measuring two hectares or the original size of their land — whichever is bigger — as well as a 250 sq feet plot for animal husbandry.
The villagers have the option to choose monetary compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare (2.4 acres) of land acquired. The villagers, however, claim that the current market value of the land is about Rs 35 lakhs per acre.
SSNNL has proposed the resettlement of 1,000 families to an ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ project planned by expert architects, to be constructed over 16 hectares of land belonging to SSNNL in Gora village. In addition, SSNNL has offered to allot shops in a shopping complex to be built in the SoU parking area for those whose shops were razed during the process of acquisition.
Rights of the tribals
Kevadia colony, in Nandod taluka of Narmada district, is a Schedule V area where the provisions of Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas), Act, 1996 (PESA) are in force.
Both Schedule V and PESA provide for the rights to territorial integrity where the tribal panchayats have to decide the course of development and also land acquisition. The laws prevent any transfer of tribal lands to non-tribal entities."

(File)
The much-talked about seaplane project around the Statue of Unity is finally seeing some movement, with work having begun to fence a natural pond near the Sardar Sarovar Dam that is infested with crocodiles, after which the pond will be evacuated and the reptiles released in the dam’s reservoir.
From Tuesday, traffic movement on the scenic roads on the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam premises was restricted after the district collector issued a notification temporarily closing the exit road along the three natural ponds until September 22.
The administration has begun the work of isolating and fencing pond 3, also known as dyke 3, to keep crocodiles at bay before the work of building the seaplane terminal starts.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Four interlinked ponds in the area are infested with crocodiles, which have been released over the years by the forest department after rescue from human settlements. Once the fencing to isolate pond 3 is complete, the forest department will restart its work of evacuating the pond of an estimated 500 crocodiles, which had been stopped in January after environmentalists raised objections.
Narmada District Collector IK Patel, who is also the CEO of Statue of Unity, told The Indian Express, “The fencing work of the pond will ensure that the crocodiles do not enter pond 3 from the other ponds around. Once we fortify the pond boundaries, the forest department will restart the work of shifting the crocodiles to the main reservoir of Sardar Sarovar dam.”
He said the notification diverting traffic was in place to enable the fencing. “The construction on the seaplane terminal will begin later,” he said.
A multi-level committee comprising of officials from the aviation department as well as private jet operators visited the site in July last year and zeroed in on pond 3 for the seaplane terminal. The rock-filled pond is officially named Panchmuli Lake and popularly called ‘Magar Talav’ as it is infested with crocodiles.
The site was finalised a few weeks later, as its dimensions suit the requirements of landing a seaplane, which requires a minimum width of 900 metres in a water body with a depth of at least six feet. This is not the first time that Panchmuli lake has been chosen for tourist activity. The lake was a boating spot until 2013 when a stranded boat with about 60 tourists was surrounded by crocodiles, causing much panic among authorities.
The Narmada Dam premises has four scenic lakes in total between Sardar Sarovar and the Main Canal head regulator, namely Vadgam Lake (pond 1), Baharfalia Lake (pond 2), Panchmuli Lake (pond 3) and Khalvani Lake (pond 4). The contoured main canal of the dam takes off from pond 4.
In January this year, the forest department had begun evacuating the pond of crocodiles, using fish as bait to capture them in cages set up around the pond. In the span of a week in January, the department captured seven of the nearly 500 crocodiles and released them into the Sardar Sarovar reservoir. The operation was, however, put off after objections by environmental activists."

The symbolism of discarding the briefcase to carry documents apart, the first Budget of the second Modi government was in stark contrast to the Budget presented in 2014. And nothing underscored it more than Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech Friday as she delivered her maiden Budget.
In 2014, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced over two dozen schemes, many with a token allocation of around Rs 100 crore. Five years on, the confidence of a second term with an enhanced majority was apparent in Sitharaman’s speech, in which she avoided new announcements with token budgetary allocations, choosing instead to focus on plans to achieve the Prime Minister’s target of a $5 trillion economy in five years.

The 2014 Budget also launched initiatives — Digital India, Skill India, Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana among others. It aimed to signal the new government’s drive to live up to the electorate’s hopes through these promises.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The first Modi government also included the Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana, Kisan TV, a 24×7 channel for the North-East, Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD), National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) — to seemingly address demands from the wider Sangh Parivar affiliates and their concerns. And to honour icons of its larger cultural nationalist political ideology, the 2014 Budget launched the Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya New Teachers Training Programme and the Statue of Unity.

In a way, through these small initiatives, the budget five years ago tried to acknowledge every section that lent its support to the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
Cut to the present, Sitharaman refrained from either launching a flurry of schemes or making token allocations to assuage a section of party’s larger support groups across the country. Riding on the enhanced mandate that came on the back of the first Modi government’s track record, Sitharaman seemed not weighed down by the demands from different sections.
This is also apparent from the structure of Sitharaman’s Budget speech which started with the premise of an ambitious but achievable target of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024. For this purpose, her speech comprised large visionary plans.

“The common man was served even as major transformational reforms were being rolled out…So, the scaling up that we talked about which marks the USP of this government is revealed in each one of these examples. We do it in that scale each time,” said Sitharaman.
Her speech did not incorporate several elements which have by now become a traditional part of every finance minister’s speech. She did not spell out spending on Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women or even agricultural credit or expenditure figures for defence in her speech. She did not indicate average revenue loss or additional revenue estimates of her proposals, leaving it to the members to read from the Budget documents provided. Barring her proposal to tax high income earning individuals, the 2019 Budget appeared anchored on the same side as that of her predecessor Jaitley.
“ We do not look down upon legitimate profit-earning,” Sitharaman declared, suggesting that her moorings were definitely not on the side of Nehruvian socialism. Jaitley, too, in his speech had indicated his belief against wasteful socialism and emphasised his belief in fiscal prudence.
Explained: Unpacking the Budget
“The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above within the next 3-4 years along with macro-economic stabilisation that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit,” Jaitley had said in 2014.
Sitharaman, in that way, stuck to the fiscal prudence and fiscal consolidation despite demands from a section of policy analysts to loosen the purse-strings for reviving the economy."

Union Home Minister Amit Shah has written to all states and Union territories, asking them to observe National Unity Day — which falls on October 31 — also the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, with “enthusiasm and fervour” following the dilution of Article 370 of the Constitution.
In a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Shah wrote on Sunday, “The celebration of Rashtriya Ekta Diwas has a special significance this year, as it marks the completion of the task of making Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh an integral part of India by abrogating Article 370. In a true sense, this represents the realisation of the dream of Sardar Patel for an integrated India.”
The Home Ministry has asked for a series of special events to be organised across the country on Thursday. Chief among these will be the first National Unity Day parade at Kevadiya in Gujarat, at the site of the Statue of Unity — the 182-m-tall statute of Patel, inaugurated last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Police forces of each state, Union Territory and Central Armed Police Forces will participate in the parade.
In addition, all district administrations have been directed to organise a ‘Run for Unity’ and pay tributes to Patel.
Shah’s letter also includes a copy of Patel’s portrait, which is to be framed in all police stations for Thursday’s tribute. It would bear the inscription — “No one would be permitted to damage the security, unity, and integrity of India.”
The letter stated, “I would request that his portrait, along with his message, may be displayed in all police stations and police offices of the country, to inspire people and police personnel alike.”
All state and Central government offices will be required to read out a pledge — “I solemnly pledge that I dedicate myself to preserve the unity, integrity and security of the nation and also strive hard to spread this message among my fellow countrymen. I take this pledge in the spirit of unification of my country which was made possible by the vision and actions of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. I also solemnly resolve to make my own contribution to ensure internal security of my country.”
Further, the Centre has instituted the Sardar Patel National Unity Award and asked states and Union territories to nominate civilians working towards national unity and integrity for the honour."

A three-day global agricultural summit,which is expected to be the first of its kind in the country,will deal with the latest technologies and innovation in farming from across the world.
Badal is likely to be the only CM to be part of this event that is aimed at projecting Modis pro-farmer image. Although chief ministers of other states have also been invited,so far only Badal,who heads the Shiromani Akali Dal,a partner party of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA),is expected to be present.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The summit will also serve as a platform for Modi to prepare ground for his iron pieces collection drive from all villages across India to construct the 182-feet tall Statue of Unity. Badal has confirmed his presence. He will be present during the inaugural function that is to be held on Monday, said a top official from the Agriculture department.
Three years ago,while invoking the Gujarat Revenue Act,1960,which states only bonafide farmers can buy and own land in Gujarat,the Kutch colllectorate had served notices to more than 500 farmers from Punjab and Haryana and also sealed some landholdings. Some of these farmers moved the Gujarat High Court against the state governement and won the case. However,the Gujarat government obtained a stay order on the HC hearing  from the Supreme Court. These farmers,who settled in Gujarat after the 1972 India-Pakistan War,have contributed to the agricultural growth of the state since the time they settled here.
According to the Summits event plans,one farmer from each of the 671 districts in India will be felicitated for his work with a cash reward of upto Rs 51,000 each.
Over 200 companies from 14 countries will participate in the exhibition that will also have 100 stalls dedicated to farmers of India to showcase the innovative methods they have adopted. The event will have special seminars by three countries,including Israel, the Netherlands and Denmark.
The government has provided space to the farmers at the centrally airconditioned exhibition dome free of cost and helped them prepare presentation materials,including short video films,powerpoint presentations,charts and posters.
Of the total 100 farmers who will take part in the meet,60 are from the state. The remaining 40 will represent Madhya Pradesh,Assam,Orissa,Punjab,Chhattisgrah,Uttarakhand,Rajasthan,Uttar Pradesh,Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The government has helped Gujarati farmers prepare short video films on how and what work they do. For participants from other states,the Gujarat government has helped in preparing multimedia presentations.

Civil engineering giants — including three Indian companies,and one South Korean and Chinese company  have shown interest in building the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue on Sadhu Island,some 3.2 km from Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district. 
Chief Minister Narendra Modi,for whom it is a pet project,has started a nation-wide mobilisation by asking farmers of seven lakh villages to donate iron from their farming equipment to be melted and used for4 the construction of the statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi laid the foundation stone for the statue on October 31,the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. The awarding of the construction contract,which was earlier fixed for December 6,has been pushed forward by the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) — a special purpose vehicle formed by the Gujarat government to execute the project under Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited.
“The big companies that have shown interest have asked for more time to chalk out technical details for the tender,” said a top-level SVPRET official.
The Asian giants in the fray — Shapoorji Pallonji Engineering and Constructions (India),JMC Projects (India) Limited,L&T(India) and Samsung C&T Corporation (Sourth Korea) — can boast of world wide operations. The fourth firm,a Chinese company  that built Spring Temple Buddha,which to date is the tallest statue in the world  is also likely to be in the fray with an Indian partner. The designing,engineering,procuring and construction tender in this regard was floated by SVPRET in August.
In the recent past,L&T has executed a couple of high profile projects with the Gujarat government including Mahatma Mandir and Swarnim Sankul-I,both located in Gandhinagar. While Mahatma Mandir,a convention center,is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi,the Swarnim Sankul-I houses the Chief Minister’s Office in Sardar Patel Secretariat.
Some of the features of the Statue of Unity,which could present a challenge to the construction companies,include bronze cladding,world’s fastest elevators to keep the visitors tour engaging,three-level public base,exhibition floor,mezzanine and roof containing a Memorial Garden,a large continuous exhibit hall that will be developed as a visitor attraction focusing on the contributions of Sardar Patel,an observation deck at 500ft that will give visitors a panoramic view of the beautiful Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges,the 256-km-long Sardar Sarovar Reservoir and the 12-km-long Garudeshwar Reservoir."

Editorial: BJP (M)
His vitriolic derision for the Congress,its leadership and Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that came to fore indicated the future tone and tenor of BJPs election campaign. While his open derision for Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan was at full display when he addressed Goa BJP workers convention in the evening,he indicated that he will work towards establishing a rival icon of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. For this purpose,he said he was going to erect worlds largest statue  Statue of Unity  of Sardar Patel,an icon Sangh Parivar highlights to undermine Nehrus contribution to Indian democracy,with contribution from each and every village across the country to commemorate Patels role in unifying India after Independence.

Modis speech in the executive and later at the Goa BJP workers convention had the theme of sowing a popular hate and resentment against the Congress leadership and its government in his role as election campaign committee chief to reap its harvest during the Lok Sabha elections. We will leave no stone unturned for Congress mukt Bharat nirman, was Modis theme during his addresses. A Congress mukt Bharat is solution to all problems facing the country, he thundered amid cheers from BJP workers.

He ridiculed Congress advertisement on Bharat Nirman. Look at their shamelessness. They ask people to believe Bharat Nirman par haq hai mera,but I think Bharat nirman par shaq hai mera, he said. He recounted his recent public encounter with the PM at last weeks chief ministers conference on internal security to highlight how he challenged the alleged soft policies of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh against Naxalism. 
He also ridiculed Congresss coalition compulsion excuse for not being able to take bold decision asking whether former external affairs minister S M Krishnas error in reading out from the speech of another country at an international fora was also because of coalition compulsion. He came down against the alleged economic mismanagement by the PM. 
Modi,who is a BCCI member and kept mum during the IPL spot-fixing scandal,ridiculed Law Minister Kapil Sibal for his proposal to frame a law to curb this practice,asserting that Sibal didnt even know that the Centre had no authority to frame a law on sports as it was states prerogative."

The new case has left the administration perplexed as none of those screened at the checkposts during this time tested positive.

For 28-year-old Hargovan Thakor, a constable attached to the Kevadia Colony police station, the last one month has been full of emotions – the steely determination to hold fort at duty to implement the Covid-19 lockdown as well as the yearning to gently hold his newborn son.
Thakor, a native of Tervada village in Kankrej taluka of Banaskantha district, was on duty in Kevadia Colony when his wife delivered their second son on March 20. However, with the then upcoming Janata Curfew on March 22 and the ongoing security deployment in view of Covid-19 meant that Thakor remained in Kevadia. Every few hours, as he finds time to sneak in a break during the arduous lockdown duty hours, Thakor catches a glimpse of his son on video calls.
A graduate in English, Thakor says, “My son is turning one month old in four days. I am longing to see him but I know that right now, I have to be here for my duty. It is a critical time for the country and even if I want to go back, I know no one will come to substitute in my absence, which will reduce the manpower by one.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Duty comes first but it does not take away the pangs of becoming a father for a second time, who also has a five-year-old son. “My wife tells me it would be so nice if I could be home. But I am at peace knowing that my parents are with her to help her. I have witnessed the birth of my first son but this time I am only seeing my newborn in photos and videos. I do wish I could just touch him once through the phone. But I will have to be patient and wait,” he says, adding that the family is yet to name the newborn.
Kevadia Colony is where the world’s tallest Statue of Unity is located. The town has been following fixed hours for essential shopping from 8 am to 12 pm for locals.
Thakor, who has been posted in Kevadia for two years, says, “I come across many violators of lockdown. At this time, while we are booking them for the violation, we are also making them understand that it is important that they stay at home. The number of cases is rising and one mistake by someone can cost an entire locality their health.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Back in his village, the family runs an agro shop, where Thakor managed the daily business until he joined the Gujarat Police force in 2017. He knows that the country will eventually tide over the crisis and he will unite with his family. “I am not intending to return to my village even immediately after the end of the lockdown because I understand that the situation is grave and this is a huge pandemic. I will return only when I am sure that my travel plans will not pose any unknown threat to my own family,” he says."

PRIME MINISTER Narendra Modi on Tuesday called the Siddaramaiah-led Congress administration in Karnataka a “seeda rupaiya’’ government that does not work unless it gets “seeda rupaiya” — or direct bribes. Modi alleged that several central government-funded programmes had stalled in the state on account of demand for bribes.
Addressing a farmers’ rally organised by the BJP in the central Karnataka district of Davangere to mark the 75th birthday of the party’s state unit president and chief minister candidate B S Yeddyurappa, the Prime Minister accused the state government of failing to spend central funds in areas of agriculture, nutrition and education.

“People think the Siddaramaiah government is in power in Karnataka, when it is actually the ‘seeda rupaiya’ government, where work gets done only if there is seeda rupaiya (direct bribe). Do you want this ‘seeda rupaiya’ culture?” Modi asked, rhyming the phrase “seeda rupaiya” with the Chief Minister’s name, Siddaramaiah. “The ‘seeda rupaiya’ government should go and an honest government must come to power.”
Karnataka, he said, needs a government that “hears the voice of the people”. Modi said, “It is clear in our hearts that the people of Karnataka are good, hardworking…the people of Karnataka are ones who will do something for the country. If Karnataka progresses, the country will also progress, and the strength of the country will increase. We help the state government in an open manner but until the 10-per cent (commission) matter is settled, work does not happen over here.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Karnataka government has been unable to spend money to the tune of Rs 21,400 crore that has been allocated to the state by the Centre, Modi said. Nearly Rs 5,000 crore allocated for nutrition programmes remains unspent and nearly Rs 4,000 crore is unspent in the education sector, Modi claimed. “This is a government that does not work,” he maintained.
Taking a dig at the Nehru-Gandhi family, Modi said, “One family that has ruled the country for 48 years has not done what a tea seller has done in 48 months. We brought cold storage, e-market and a lot of other measures to improve the profit of farmers.”
He said, “Our aim is to double the income of farmers by using scientific methods. Soil cards are helping farmers understand their soil situation and farmers are now spending wisely on seeds and fertilisers and their produce is increasing.”
At the rally, the PM flagged off a BJP initiative to collect a fistful of grain from farmers around the state in an effort to show solidarity with the farming community. The grain collected from each district will be used to cook a meal for the general public at a temple, mutt or historical place at each district headquarters between March 12 and 15.

Modi likened the initiative to his efforts to build the Statue of Unity in Gujarat by collecting iron from all villages in the state."

The online Common Eligibility Test (CET) for recruitment to non-gazetted posts will ease the difficulties faced by aspirants for government jobs, particularly those from poor and unprivileged sections, Union minister Jitendra Singh said on Friday.
Releasing a digital book titled ‘Aarambh’ and highlighting the achievements of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), he said even during the coronavirus pandemic this department set new standards of functioning, which were not only widely hailed but also emulated.
For example, the DoPT’s iGOT (Integrated Government Online Training Programme) incorporated an exclusive course on coronavirus awareness and COVID-19 warriors’ training for which within a few weeks over 23 lakh officers registered themselves, the minister said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

One of the most important initiatives this year was the exercise to set up the National Recruitment Agency (NRA), which will conduct computer-based online Common Eligibility Test (CET) for recruitment to non-gazetted posts with examination centres in every district, Singh said.
This, he said, will ease the difficulties faced by aspirants for government jobs, particularly those from poor and unprivileged sections.
The minister said, true to the title of ‘Aarambh’, the year 2019-20 was marked with a number of new beginnings, the most important of which was the first-ever experiment of interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi by 425 trainee officers from 21 civil services at the Statue of Unity portraying Sardar Patel at Kevadia, Gujarat.

These officers were part of the common foundation course of 21 service and were selected through the Civil Services Examination, said the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
The agencies working under the aegis of the DoPT like, for instance, Kendriya Bhandar promptly came out to provide essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, sanitiser and other items in the early days of the pandemic when there were some reports of initial shortage of these items in certain parts of the country, he said, highlighting the DoPT’s achievements.
Among those who attended the launch of the e-book were DoPT Secretary C Chandramouli and Additional Secretary Rashmi Choudhary, while the other officers connected through video conference."

The loh daan (iron collection) drive for the proposed Statue of Unity is set to get a fresh push with the Narendra Modi-led government in Gujarat preparing to launch the second round of the campaign.

Early this week, a round of meetings was conducted by top ministers, including Revenue minister Anandi Patel and Finance minister Nitin Patel, to chalk out the plan. The second round will involve state departments, BJP workers and NGOs, besides an organised advertisement campaign.

The state Information department will conduct a nationwide drive through new audio-video documentaries featuring the BJP’s PM candidate that are likely to be aired on local and national television channels and other public platforms.

Sources said ministers and senior BJP leaders have given fresh instructions to party units to welcome the trucks that will bring back iron tools from farmers. The trucks, flagged off on December 28, carry nearly three-lakh empty kit boxes and are scheduled to visit seven lakh villages to collect specimen of soil and scrap-iron farm implements after prior intimation sent to 1.87 village panchayats.

NGOs have been asked to see that special gram panchayats for iron collection are arranged on time.

Meanwhile, party workers across Gujarat have started collecting “holy mud” from places of worship which will be used to lay the foundation of the statute. Last week, leaders in election wards were given three containers each and a bottle to collect mud from mosques, temples, gurdwaras and churches. In each of the 25 election wards, the BJP leaders are said to have collected the mud from all religious places.

Vadodara MP, Balkrishna Shukla, said the drive gives cities the experience of “partaking in the major feat” of the Statue of Unity. Shukla, who has been gathering support from villages around Vadodara for contribution of iron towards the statue said, “Villages will contribute metal as well as mud while cities will contribute mud. This drive will be undertaken across all major cities of the country.”

Slamming the view of the critics that this as an exercise to transform Modi’s image, city BJP president Bharat Dangar said, “Modi is a secular leader. He does not need to prove that. Even after the SIT has given him a clean chit, if there are people who think he is communal then there is something wrong with their mind.”

Meanwhile, heads of various places of worship in the city were more than willing to help. The head of one of the prominent religious places in the city from where the BJP leaders collected the mud said, “When they approached us for the mud, we willingly gave it away.We are all for peace and unity no matter what form it is in. The concept of collecting something from each and every part of the country and creating one single structure is definitely something significant, whatever be the reason behind it.”"

(File)
In just over a year of its unveiling, the Statue of Unity has surpassed the footfall at the 133-year-old Statue of Liberty in the US, with an average of over 15,000 tourists visiting the monument in Gujarat daily.
“With 74 per cent increase over the daily average of the first year, that is, November 1, 2018, to October 31, 2019, daily average of 15,036 is now registered in the first month of this second year.
“This has further increased to 22,430 on weekend days. The Statue of Liberty of New York, United States, attracts around 10,000 visitors a day!” a statement by Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Statue of Unity is a statue of Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of the country. With a height of 182 metres, it is the world’s tallest statue. It is located near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada in Kevadiya colony in Gujarat.
Designed by Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar, the project was first announced in 2010, and was finally unveiled on October 31 last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the statement, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd credited the rise in footfall at the monument to the addition of several new tourist attractions such as jungle safari, children’s nutrition park, cactus garden, butterfly garden, Ekta nursery, dino trail, river rafting, boating, alongside multiple budget accommodation options.
“These additional tourist attractions have led to a sharp increase in the daily tourists’ footfall during November 2019,” it said.
It also added that a total of 30,90,723 tourists have visited Kevadia till November 30 this year, generating a total income of Rs 85.57 crore."

However,the delegation,headed by finance minister Nitin Patel and comprising three MPs,six MLAs,a mayor,a zila panchayat chairman and senior government officers from Gujarat ,interacted with various social organisations here seeking their support for the project and also held a workshop related to the project with BJP workers and members of various NGOs. 
The 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is coming up on an island on Narmada river at a cost of Rs 2,074 crore. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To garner public support for the project,a Run for Uni-ty is being organised at more than 565 places across the country on December 15 by Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,formed under chai-rmanship of Narendra Modi. 
Patel told The Indian Express that his officials had sought time from the Uttar Pradesh Governor as well as the Chief Minister for a meeting so as to solicit their moral cooperation for Run for Unity and Statue of Unity project. However,he said,the Governor was reportedly not in city while the CM had a packed schedule. 
An official accompanying Patel confirmed that a senior Gujarat government officer had sought appointment from UP CM to meet the delegation 15 days ago. 
Patel denied any political significance of the project for the BJP. Narendra Modiji had announced this project before the Assembly elections in 2012, he said.  Modi had laid the foundation stone of the statue on October 31 and the project is scheduled to be completed in the next three years. He also added a global tender has been floated to select firms for the project."

The letter will be sent by Chief Minister Narendra Modi in a corrugated box,with a mounted GPS chip and will ask the sarpanches to call back on a dedicated phone number.
This exercises is considered most important by team Modi,of what is billed as the biggest grassroots movement in history of India   Statue of Unity movement,consisting of run for unity at 1,000 places on December 15,an essay competition in two lakh urban schools and collection of iron pieces from seven lakh villages with a target of 5,000 tonnes. This is pre-cursor to build the 182-feet statue of Sardar Vallbhbhai Patel near Sardar Sarovar Dam. 
The total number of return calls from sarpanches will be crucial as it will not only help the Modi team assess his popularity but also help them build a rapport with village heads,which could be crucial when the Chief Minister begins his run for Delhi. Modi’s letter will be written in 11 different regional languages. This,team Modi feels,will helkp him make inroads into rural India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
We will keep a close eye on which village heads will call up, said a top-level officer involved with the project while adding that to expect two lakh calls   the number of letters to be sent  is over ambitious. But the total number will definitely help the team gauge acceptance of the project and Modi. 
Apart from making the call,the gram panchayats will be asked by Citizens for Accountable Governance  the NGO that has designed the three-layered movement  to fill up a form with details and photographs of villagers supporting the movement. The photos will be a permanent part of a photo collage at the gallery at the 182-feet State of Unity to come up at Sadhu Island,3 km from Sardar Sarovar Dam in Narmada district in Gujarat. A business envelop,which the villagers can use to send back documents,will also be part of the kit in the box.
Officials involved with the project believe that given Modi’s popularity even outside Gujarat,a letter from him to a village sarpanch and his appeal to send their photographs will definitely generate good response. In general,people are curious about him. And,when it is about responding to his appeals,made in their own language,there is very high chance of a good response,” an official added.
The corrugated box with the letter will also be used to bring back a piece of farm iron from the villages. The GPS chip on the box will help organisers track it. It is proposed to have a godown either in Vadodara or Narmada district to collect all boxes that have been sent back with a piece of iron.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday slammed the Statue of Unity, the pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the PM was promoting Make in India but had given the work of building the statue to China. On the second day of his three-day Saurashtra tour, the Congress leader said it is a matter of shame that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue too is being cast in China.
“NDA government gives employment to only one lakh persons per year in the country… Our competition is with China. Whatever you buy from shops, be it watch, camera, shirt, pants–‘Made in China’ will be written on back of them all. Sardar Patel’s statue is being built. But that too is being cast in China and ‘Made in China’ will be inscribed there at its back. This is a matter of shame,” Modi said while addressing a gathering in Dhrol town of Jamnagar along his Navsarajan Yatra route.
Rahul said the Indian government provides employment to only 400 youths out of the 30,000 being added to working-age population of the country every day. On the other hand, China gives employment to 40,000 such youths every day, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Addressing the Patidars present in the gathering, Rahul said if the Congress came to power in the state, the government will take everybody along and take Gujarat forward. “I want tell Patidars who are standing here. BJP has fired on your community members and subjected them to atrocities. But this is not the way of Congress. We work in an environment of love and fraternity. We take everybody along. It is our promise that we shall take everybody along and take Gujarat forward,” he said.
While Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki told the largely Patidar crowd that it was time to ‘take revenge for atrocities Patidars have been subjected during quota stir’, Rahul asked them to show a new way to the country via Gujarat. “You gave Sardar Patel to country. Gujarat gave Sardar Patel to country. (Now), you have to show a way to entire country. Only Gujarat, and no other state can do it,” said Rahul, even as he indirectly exhorted Patidars to vote for the Congress in the upcoming Assembly elections.
“Governments in Gujarat and India have forgotten farmers… Whatever promises Modi gives to his industrialist friends, he fulfills them immediately. He gives him land, water electricity etc. But he doesn’t honour promises made to farmers, small businessmen, youths, labourers etc of Gujarat and India,” said Rahul.
He said if Congress comes to power, the government will strengthen cooperatives and help small businesses. “Modi’s Gujarat model is a failure. There is need to reintroduce the old Amul model, which takes everybody along. Congress will form government here, we shall take everybody on board and Gujarat will show the way to the entire country one more time,” added the Congress vice-president.
Addressing a gathering in Otala village of Tankara taluka in Morbi, Rahul raked up issues of employment and farm produce prices. “There are 30 lakh unemployed youth in Gujarat. PM talks about Make in India and there are 30 lakh unemployed youth in Gujarat. What price do you realise for your groundnut? Rs600? What price had Modi promised? Wasn’t it 1200? And what do you get for cotton? Rs 700? And what had Modi promised? (crowd responds Rs 1500). Did everyone get a home? When do you get electricity, at the night or in morning? For the last 22 years there is talk of Narmada water. Did you get it? Modi told so many lies that vikas hi pagal ho gaya (development itself went mad),” he said.
He alleged that Gujarat was currently controlled from New Delhi and that it worked for a handful of big business houses. “Most importantly, the government in Gujarat must be run from Gujarat and not from Delhi via remote-control… These days, government in Gujarat works for five-ten industrialists. Your land, water, electricity is given to them. This is Gujarat model of the BJP,” Rahul said adding that big businesses are needed but the country cannot progress by promoting them only.
He promised the villagers that Congress will provide a government that is run from Gujarat and which works for farmers, small businessmen, youth, labourers, the poor etc. Rahul also claimed Congress was the common thread binding great leaders. While addressing a public meeting on the compound of Uma ginning factory, Rahul said, “There was convergence in ideas of (Mahatma) Gandhiji, (Jawaharlal), Sardar Patel and (BR) Ambedkar but there were differences also. Congress synthesised ideas of these four and showed the way to the country. Our job is to bind together. We listen to everyone and take country on the way you wish. But BJP people don’t listen to people. They have decided that they know everything. That they are fountainhead of knowledge and only work they have to do is amplify their voice and tell people about their ideology.”
He also raked up the recent violence at the Banaras Hindu University campus saying women were beaten up on the varsity’s campus but PM will only tell his ‘mann ki baat’. “You know what you require but BJP will never ask you what you want. And when you rise to demand your right, they will shoot you. Policemen will beat up women in your homes. Instead of listening to you, they will beat you up. A few days ago, women were beaten up by police on BHU campus. Whoever raises questions, be he farmer, Dalit, tribal, Patidar is beaten up. But the PM will tell only his maan ki baat (thoughts in his mind),” he said.
In the same vein, he said the BJP didn’t listen to anybody on demonitisation and GST and therefore economy of the country took severe hit. “We had proposed only single rate of tax under GST but they kept five. One shopkeeper told me that he is selling dry fruits but there are different tax rates for pista, almonds and cashew nuts are different and that he was unable to comprehend what rates he should charge (his customers). In packets, all three are mixed. What should he do?” Rahul asked mockingly.
He suggested BJP could learn from Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel. “Country suffered heavy losses as they (BJP) are not willing to listen. Gandhi and Sardar Patel spent their entire lives listening to people and that’s why they were leaders of Congress. And these people didn’t order to fire on anybody in the society. There never arose such a need as they used to listen to people,” said Rahul.
He said that Gujarat had shown in the past how the issue of unemployment can be tackled. “Wherever Modi goes, he promotes Make in India. But whenever you walk into a shop, it’s all Made in China,” Rahul said adding that helping small businesses will generate employment. “And you have proven that you can do it.

Rahul also claimed credit for IITs and IIMs. “A few days ago, Sushma Swaraj talked about IITs and IIMs. I was quite happy. Earlier, Modi used to question what happened in 70 years. Now, his minister has said that the idea of IITs and IIMs was idea of the Congress party,” he said."

The 53rd annual DGP conference was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on its second day Friday. While secrecy was maintained regarding the proceedings, according to sources, discussions during the conference included issues pertaining to national security, threats emerging from cyber crime and left wing extremism.
A presentation was also made on the “Enduring legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and relevance of his political ideals today”, the sources said.
PM Modi arrived at Vadodara airport early on Friday morning where he was received by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel and state Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi. He then visited the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district, where he paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and later reached the tent city near the Statue, where “luxury tents” have been set up for the conference.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Following his visit to the Statue, the PM tweeted, “As India’s Home Minister, his contribution towards building the framework of our security systems is immense.”
“I would specially urge you all to visit Kevadia and see the ‘Statue of Unity.’ Some friends told me that the Statue can also be seen during Delhi-Mumbai flights. So, next time you are flying that route do try to spot the Statue,” he said in another tweet.
The Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, CRPF Cobra commandos, NSG commandos, Chetak commandos and Marine commandos participated in a ‘Ek Bharat, Sreshta Bharat’ parade, which was inspected by the Prime Minister.
Day two of the conference ended with a performance from all states on the ‘Ek Bharat, Sreshta Bharat’ theme. Over 200 performers from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations performed various folk and classical dance forms of every state, including Kathakali, Mayurbhanj Chhau, Garba Raas, Lu Khangthamo, Bharatnatyam and others. The performances began with a tribute to Sardar Patel on a song titled ‘Humare hero hai Sardar’ which narrated the story of Sardar Patel unifying the 565 erstwhile princely states.
Another performance highlighted the festivals of India. A laser show also displayed life and times of Patel. The cultural event was followed by a dinner for all the senior police officials.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju, Hansraj Ahir and all the senior police officials were also present at the event."

With the Narmada water-level steadily rising, officials of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) are hopeful that the dam will reach its full reservoir level (FRL) of 138.63 metre by the end of this monsoon.
On Friday, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who arrived in Kevadia colony on a two-day visit, said that the government did not need permission from the Narmada Control Authority (NCA) to fill the dam. On Saturday, the dam stood at 132.30 metres, with all 30 gates closed.
According to SSNNL officials, with one more month for the monsoon to withdraw, the dam is most likely to reach its FRL. “We are estimating that the level will rise to 138.63 metres by the end of monsoon. The rain in the catchment area is heavy and the inflow from Madhya Pradesh has been steady too. The dam is anyway at its highest level so far even at 132.3 metres because we have not been able to go beyond 130 in the last two years.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Friday, Rupani, while answering queries from the media persons, said that the government does not need permission from the NCA to fill the dam to its FRL so long as the protocol is followed. “We have to be judicious in following the dam protocol while raising the level in the reservoir. There is no need to seek permission,” Rupani said in response to questions about a recent statement by Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel about the government needing approval from the NCA to fill the dam to its FRL.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The group,comprising around 17 activists led by Vadodara-based Rohit Prajapati,have stated that the project that involves construction on the riverbed and proposed reservoir – close to the sanctuary in eco-sensitive zone – will have serious impact on the ecology and environment and,therefore,the EIA and EC are crucial.
The project includes the construction of a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Narmada riverbed on Sadhu bet,3.2 km downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam site.

SpiceJet has wet-leased a 18-seater Twin Otter 300 seaplane from Maldivian Aero, the national airline of Maldives. A wet lease is an agreement between two airlines, where the lessor agrees to provide an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance to the lessee.
“The aircraft will undergo routine maintenance for two days. There will be no seaplane operations on Wednesday and Thursday,” said an official of SpiceJet who did not wish to be identified. The aircraft is expected to be back in operation on November 6.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The aircraft, which is being operated by Maldivian crew, can accomodate two pilots, one attendant and 15 passengers. It took off from Male, Maldives, before October 25 and landed on Ahmedabad on October 27, 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the seaplane service on October 31. The seaplane is 49 years old. As part of the lease agreement, “one set of crew and engineers with back up” have come with the seaplane.
“It has been flying continously for the past one week and hence some maintainance was needed,” the official added. SpiceJet has planned four flights on the route between Sabarmati Riverfront and Statue of Unity. However, only two flights were being operated daily (11 am and 2.30 pm) from the riverfront since November 1.
“The Twin Otter 300 is a small turboprop aircraft. These aircraft need more maintenance than bigger jets. Since the operations have just begun, maintenance is being done during the daytime… The aircraft is fitted with remarkably efficient Twin Turboprop Pratt & Whitney PT6A-27 engines, known for their reliability. The aircraft has an incredible accident-free history,” SpiceJet stated in response to a questionnaire mailed to them regarding the aircraft’s maintainance.
“The seaplane chosen by SpiceJet is one of the safest and most widely used aircraft the world over and in Maldives. The aircraft has been serviced at regular intervals and is in top class condition,” the airline stated.
The seaplane is docked at jetty at the water aerodrome in Sabarmati Riverfront, where the maintainance work will be undertaken. “As per the lease agreement, maintainance is the responsibility of the Maldivian firm,” the SpiceJet official added.
Despite the break in operations, inquiries continued to pour at the booking window of SpiceJet at the Sabarmati riverfront water aerodrome. PK Gohil, a resident of Ambawadi who came to inquire about the seaplane bookings, said,
“I was not able to place a booking request on the Spice Shuttle website and so I visited the water aerodrome in person. Seven members of my family were planning to visit SoU before Diwali and I was told that the seaplane is under maintenance and the next available date was November 7. They asked me to place my booking request online.”

Gohil and his family is looking to travel one way to SoU. “We will ask our driver to pick us from SoU in our car. The lady at the booking window told me that the tickets will be priced differently and it will cost us on an average Rs 2,500 per person for a one-way ticket,” he added.
During three days of operations, an estimated 100-odd persons have already flown the sea plane between the two locations in Gujarat. SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh said that the airline was flooded with booking requests and on the first day, 3,000 booking requests were made through the website."

Bhupendra Rana
Mocking Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his recent temple visits in poll-bound Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said a person who has never lifted a “puja ki thali” was now applying tilak and wearing garlands. Addressing a public gathering in Bharuch on the last day of the BJP’s Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, Chouhan said “mafia raj” prevailed during Congress rule in Gujarat, but under subsequent BJP governments the state witnessed long-lasting peace.
“Now, Rahulbaba is visiting Gujarat often because elections are near. He is also offering prayers at various temples…(a person) who has never lifted a puja ki thali is applying a big tilak and wearing big garlands, without having knowledge about the great culture of this country, otherwise he would not have commented on (no) women (in the RSS),” Chouhan told the public gathering after offering prayers at a Sai temple here. He was referring to the Congress leader’s recent comment that he had not seen “a single woman in an RSS shakha wearing shorts”.
Chouhan also said Gujarat was under curfew for “half the year” during Congress rule and “mafia were running the government”. He said Gujarat has become a peaceful state during BJP rule for over 22 years. He also accused the Congress of “neglecting” Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. At a gathering in Ankleshwar, Chouhan alleged that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir has remained unresolved because Jawaharlal Nehru did not assign it to Sardar Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said, “They (Congress) conferred Bharat Ratna on Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, but ignored Sardar Patel for many years…. Almost after 40 years of his death, he (Sardar) was conferred Bharat Ratna.”
He hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Statue of Unity project to honour Sardar Patel. “I want to remember three great sons of this land (Gujarat) — Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel without whom it was impossible to unite India, and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is tirelessly working to make India a superpower.”
Reacting to the social media campaign Vikas Gando Thayo Che, mocking the development claims of the BJP government, Chouhan said, “One needs vision and intelligence to see the development which is everywhere in Gujarat.”
“The Congress was thinking that they will win the election by just giving slogans and allurements, but after seeing development on the ground they are… defaming development,” he said. Chouhan was joined by Union minister Parshottam Rupala and Gujarat Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja during the yatra."

Nearly 60 km from Kevadiya Colony where the mammoth Statue of Unity is waiting to be unveiled, a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel stands surrounded by tall grass and eerie silence on the premises of Sardar Sugar mill in Sankheda. Eleven years ago, the cooperative-run sugar mill, named after the country’s first Home Minister, had to be closed down after financial bungling by its board members. Since then over 1,500 farmers of four districts — Chhota Udepur, Panchmahals, Vadodara and Narmada — who had sold 2.62 lakh tonnes of sugarcane to the mill, are waiting for their payment that amounts to Rs 12 crore.
After numerous pleas to the government, and ongoing litigation in the case, the affected farmers are now planning to protest during the unveiling of the Statue of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Patel, to make the government take note of their issue and order relief. They have also threatened to drown themselves in protest at Kevadiya Colony on October 31st when the 182-metre-tall statue will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“We have our statue of unity here at the factory dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The new statue means nothing to us when farmers are still facing financial crisis because of the government’s apathy. For the last 11 years, we have been fighting but in vain,” said Kaushik Patel, who had sold 389.73 tonne of sugarcane to the mill and is yet to get Rs 2.18 lakh for it.
According to Chhota Udepur Collector Sujal Mayatra, the issue dates back to 2008 when due to “irregularities of funds and mismanagement”, the Sardar Sugar mill was shut down. “An audit was conducted and discrepancies in funds by the nominated members of the co-operative board were found. Therefore, the board was dissolved and the mill was shut down. The mill had a debt (Rs 10 crore) and to clear that an auction was held. A Mumbai-based firm, Sitaram Sugar, bought the mill (for Rs 36 crore in 2011),” said the Collector. The 15-member cooperative board that operated the sugar mill had government-nominated members.
Between 2008 and 2011, before the mill was auctioned, the farmers made several representations before the district collector, as well as various government bodies, including Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Director of Sugar among others. They even took their case to the State Wide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology (SWAGAT) in 2009, a redressal system presided over by the then chief minister Narendra Modi.
When the mill went under hammer, the farmers believed that their ordeal has come to an end. But it did not turn out to be so. A petition was filed in the Gujarat High Court which is still pending.  “When the High Court intervened and auctioned the factory, 326 farmers claimed their shares from the money raised. But the battle is still on in the court and we are still waiting for our payments,” added Kaushik Patel, the farmer.
According to former executive director of the cooperative mill, Kanchan Patel, who is a BJP member and sarpanch of Alikherav gram panchayat in Bodeli, the factory was “a very ambitious project”. “Initially, the business went smooth and we recorded profit. But certain decisions reversed the trend. Since then we have been a part of this battle,” he said."

The job,scheduled to begin on October 31,the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,will be handled entirely  from project publicity to collection and transportation   by social groups and organisations with networking and mobilising background.
While Modi himself has made a full-out appeal to farmers from several states every time he addressed events attended by them in the past four months,the government will give these groups contracts to collect iron from farming tools from each of the over 7 lakh villages in the country  for the Rs 2,000 crore project. This will be in addition to other political and social groups,including Bhartiya Kisan Sangh,RSS and Bajrang Dal,which will help the government reach out to remote villages. Funds will be raised through charity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Social groups and organisations with networking and mobilising skills will be roped in, said a top official from Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited. He added,Soon tenders will be invited…Those with strong network base will be awarded the contracts.
The 182-meter Statue of Unity project,incorporating research labs,a college and tourists facilities,is to come up at Sadhu Island,which is facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia colony. Modi is likely to kickstart the drive from Kevadia colony on October 31. The iron pieces collection drive will end on January 26.
The contracts,however,will avoid translating as profits for the involved groups. The government will  see that organisations and groups are adequately paid to successfully transfer a piece of iron from a remote village in any corner of India to Kevadia colony.
While the state government representatives cannot cover all the villages,volunteers of the groups will fan out,talk to village panchayats and farmers,collect 5,000 metric tonne from villages across India. At 182 metre,it is expected to surpass the tallest statue in the world,which is currently Chinas Spring Temple Buddha at 128 m. The Ushiku Daibtsu,also of the Buddha,is in Japan at 110 m and the Statue of Liberty in New York stands at 93 metre.
The first phase of the construction that will start in November will take nearly five years to complete. Modi himself has often described it as double the size of Statue of Liberty.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
However,not all the iron pieces donated by the farmers are likely to go in the construction of the main statue,considering the quality factor of the statue. Iron not fit for the main statue will be used in other structures that are to be erected within the complex The remaining quantity of iron required for the statue is likely to be procured from the Steel Authority of India."

Joseph Stalin, the tale goes, wanted to commemorate Vladimir Lenin — to show his respect for the architect of the Russian Revolution — by building a statue to honour the latter on his birth anniversary. When the statue, designed by Stalin himself, was finally unveiled, Lenin was nowhere to be seen. Finally, a scared member of the Central Committee asked: “Comrade, a fine piece of public art. You look particularly strong and brilliant reading that book. But… ummm… wasn’t it supposed to honour Lenin?” “Well,” replied the General Secretary, “can’t you see I’m reading his book?”
The content of propaganda, much like pornography, is meant to serve a single purpose. When the government, and in some cases the state itself, is an ideologically driven one, the task of honing that message becomes both simpler and more difficult.
The current NDA government has spent considerable resources communicating the successes of its programmes and initiatives. In terms of its final goal, the campaigns of the BJP and Union government have a simple, easily discernible end: To showcase the prime minister as the final arbiter and first cause of achche din. In terms of actually achieving this goal, complex and subtle shifts are underway in how mass communication takes place.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Government ads, of course, are nothing new. And statues (while more modest than the Statue of Unity), are hardly a rarity across the country. The difference, in marketing and advertising terms, lies in the brand that the ongoing information carpet bombing is meant to build.
The first discernible change is how policies are now publicised. Take the ads proclaiming the success of the PM’s Ujjwala Yojana. In essence, they bear the same child-like enunciation, the resort to cliche and a sort of throwback to a time before the high-definition sheen of the digital era. The key difference from earlier government ads lies in the message: Prime Minister Modi saved my life, freed me from drudgery through a gas connection, the “rural woman” declares. The PM is presented as a personal saviour, not merely a political leader in distant Delhi.

Even when the PM is not directly the subject of a particular image, he is what the visual alludes to. Two photographs, both relatively recent, are symptomatic of this endeavour. The first is a photo of the prime minister in a regal pose, looking with satisfaction at the Statue of Unity in the distance. The second is more on the nose: Modi is touching up his own wax statue at Madame Tussaud’s.
The attempt that is being made in New India is not novel. In commercial advertising, a truly successful brand is an open signifier. In other words, an image or word does not contain one stable meaning, but rather, is shorn of its context and history — facts of any sort really. This is what makes it possible for the idea to try and gain seemingly universal appeal. Take the Nike logo, a simple tick mark. The symbol stands for more than just running shoes (its original USP) or apparel or any single or group of items that build up the inventory of the company. Now, if that tick mark appears backed by the company on, say, bottled water, it is still a Nike product, despite not bearing even a family resemblance to what the company was all about in the first place. Of course, in Nike’s case, the expansion of the logo is still far from universal — the new product will still have to be sold as a “sporty” or “active” drink.
A similar attempt is now being made with a person, the prime minister — to create a brand, an image to which all future achievements and works are attributed to. But it is precisely because of his complexity, and the contours of the ideological formation he belongs to, that the prime minister cannot be so easily emptied out of his context and meaning.
In terms of political propaganda, one of the most successful open, near universal signifiers was the Nazi Swastika. As Malcolm Quinn convincingly illustrates in Swastika: Constructing the Symbol, the actual image of a hooked cross appears across times, geographies and civilisations. It took a significant advertising (propaganda) efforts to destroy its history, cultural diversity and differences in meaning to make it a symbol of anti-semitism, totalitarianism and bigotry for much of the Western world. And a symbol of nationalism, racial pride and strength in the Third Reich.
Logos and symbols, of course, are far easier to manipulate and create anew than people. Why, then, haven’t the lotus and the galaxy of leaders in the Sangh Parivar — rather than a single person — been at the centre of political communication for the last four-odd years? Why try to make one man, however popular, take the credit and even perhaps the responsibility for all government action?
One of the appeals of the Sangh and the BJP was and continues to be the purported absence of dynasty in their top leadership. Rather than the Nehru-Gandhi parivar of the Congress, which has certainly imprinted its name across schemes and roads and airports, an ideological parivar was on offer — one whose politics was, in their own understanding, unsullied by cults of personality. The compulsions of electoral politics seem to have changed all that.
The task now, as the brand-building exercise continues to progress, will be two-fold. First, any failings past or present of the signifier will be erased. This will be a tough exercise because, unlike in Stalin’s Russia, an opposition does exist and while it may now, in part, be responding to an agenda rather than setting it, that could change with a few electoral reversals. Second, and even more difficult, is the fact that with a signifier that is also a person with a history and politics of his own, not all figures are appropriated easily to serve his image.
Despite its attempts, the current government’s co-opting a figure like Sardar Patel will only be partially successful. A Statue Of Unity can, of course, be so huge as to over-awe a sense of history. And perhaps all Lenin is reduced to is someone Stalin read. On the other hand, its size could also bear testimony to the differences between Iron Men, the contrast between two projects of nation-building."

A good part of the  money for the renovation has come from the MPLAD fund of union minister for Human Resource Development Smriti Irani who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Anand.
The trust-run school had closed down in 1965 after a new primary school was constructed in the vicinity. The school since then lay neglected, and had turned into a dumpyard with overgrown weeds covering the building. The school was under the care of Sardar Patel Trust—managed by Patel’s family members—but the trust could not renovate the building for want of fund and had been approaching the state government for help.

The trust was given care of the school by the then Keshubhai Patel government in 1998, and was even granted some fund that apparently fell short of the required amount. Subsequent governments could turned down the demand for fund by the trust. It was only a year ago, after the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi took forward his pet project, the Rs 2,600-crore Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in Narmada district, in earnest, that the school was again brought to the notice of the state government who asked the trust to hand it over to the Karamsad municipality for further development.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Until a year ago, virtually nobody was interested in renovating the building which was in a very bad shape. There was shortage of fund for the project and the government was also not much interested. When the trust handed over the school to the municipality a year ago that we took up the matter on a priority basis, with the aim of reviving it by October 31, Patel’s birth anniversary,” said president of Karamsad nagarpalika, Nilesh Patel.
The renovation began around six months back and Rs 95 lakh was spent on it, with the state government offering Rs 25 lakh while a large chunk of Rs 40 lakh coming from the local area development (MPLAD) grant of HRD minister Smriti Irani. Remaining Rs 30 lakh was contributed by the industrial units situated at the nearby GIDC.
The new building with tiled roof replicates the design of the school that Patel attended between 1882 and 1888, its model based on an old photograph that the Karamsad nagarpalika sourced from Patel’s family. Apart from chambers converted into museum displaying around sixty photographs of Patel depicting him as a 17-year-old college going youth and a dapper young man pursuing law at a college in the UK, as well as his different moods during his involvements in India’s freedom struggle, the building also has a two rooms that have been earmarked for a library being developed for senior citizens.
Inaugurating the school on the occasion of Patel’s 139th birth anniversary on Friday, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel said Patel will inspire children attending the anganwadi within the school. “It is a moment of pride for me to attend the school where Sardar Patel once studied and took primary education. This is a great opportunity for us all to inculcate Sardar’s values in our life. We are thankful to PM Narendra Modi for declaring the day as National Unity Day,” Anandiben wrote in the visitor’s book.
Further, while addressing the public, Patel recalled Sardar’s contribution in uniting India and asked the audience to take inspiration from his “exemplary life dedicated to nation building.” Criticising Congress government’s effort to forget Patel’s birth anniversary, Anandiben praised PM Narendra Modi for bringing to the fore the “greatness of Sardar Saheb”  after taking over as country’s Prime Minister."

Described as a ‘must-visit’ place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the town, nestled amid Satpura and Vindhayachal ranges along the banks of the Narmada river, has a number of small and big tourist spots.
Gujarat’s Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta, who has been associated with the project since its beginning, said it was the prime minister’s vision to develop this place as a model tourist destination for the entire family.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the town has been developed as a tourist destination for the entire family while preserving its ecology and local heritage,” Gupta told PTI.
He said the main attraction of the town, the Statue of Unity, ideated by Prime Minister Modi himself, attracts more tourists than the Statue of Liberty in the United States.
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, around 13,000 tourists were visiting the statue daily, while around 10,000 tourists visited the Statue of Liberty last month.
Development in the town generated direct employment for 3,000 tribal boys and girls, and indirect employment to 10,000 more, Gupta said, adding it has also opened up new avenues of micro-entrepreneurship for women.
About the various tourist attractions in Kevadia, Gujarat’s Tourism Secretary Mamta Verma said there is variety, something for every member of a family in Kevadia.
“If there is Arogya Van for elders, there is a children nutrition park for kids, then there are options for camping and river rafting for youngsters,” she said.
For nature lovers, Verma said there is Sardar Patel Zoological Park and Geodesic Aviary Dome, which is home to more than 1,100 birds and animals and five lakh plants.
Under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, this place has been developed with least commercialisation, so that its natural beauty remains intact, she said."

The development comes a day after BJP Lok Sabha MP from Bharuch, Mansukh Vasava, submitted his resignation from the party to party’s state chief C R Paatil. Last week Mansukh had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out issues in the notifying of the tribal lands under eco-sensitive zones.

While Vasava announced his decision to withdraw the resignation Wednesday, the state BJP tribal cell leaders said that the government had decided to “correct the mistake” made by the Narmada district administration that had led to “deep anguish and misunderstanding” among the tribal communities. The district administration, however, maintained that it is following the “guidelines” of the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in matters of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Wednesday, tribal leaders of the BJP, including Vasava, also attended a meeting chaired by state Cabinet Minister Ganpat Vasava to “look into the issues” of the tribal communities in Narmada after notices were issued by the taluka mamlatdars to execute the MoEFCC’s May 2016 notification. Senior party leaders said a resolution was passed stating the state government would issue a new guideline and thereby “withdraw the revenue record entry” for the eco-sensitive zones earmarked in 14 villages of Garudeshwar taluka where the entries have been made so far. These villages are a part of the 121 under the eco-sensitive zone.
Former BJP MLA from Dediapada, Motilal Vasava, who is the head of the party’s state tribal cell, told The Indian Express, “In the meeting, we put forth the fact that the miscommunication and misunderstanding among the tribals regarding the notification on the eco-sensitive zone have created a major issue, which the Opposition was exploiting… The district administration had wrongly made entries in the revenue records and included rights of the state government which gave an impression to the tribals that the former has become an owner of their land. It is not a part of the provisions. This mistake has to be corrected, and so, the government will make an announcement within a day or two.”
While the party leaders shifted the blame on to the district administration, the Narmada district authorities maintain that they were only following the “guidelines” of the MoEFCC. Resident Additional Collector of Narmada, HK Vyas, told The Indian Express that the entry in the revenue record was made as per the “provisions” in the “beeja haq” (other rights) column of the land records, which must reflect the status of the lands as “eco-sensitive zone”. He also clarified that the withdrawal of the physical entry would not change the status of the land or the zone.
“There has been a misunderstanding that the state government is trying to seek ownership on the lands. The fact is that the entire area, all 121 villages included, have been under the ESZ since May 5, 2016, when the final notification was published by the MoEFCC. However, the execution of the notification, as per the provisions, was not done, which means the mandatory requirement to mark the ESZ entry on the status of the land on the revenue record. The exercise was undertaken recently after requests from the Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) Narmada, but was misunderstood due to the ignorance and miscommunication among the locals,” Vyas said.
The officer added that following the resolution of the state government to “withdraw” the revenue record entry, marking lands as ESZ, the respective revenue offices will now “physically verify” the status of the lands on a case-to-case basis if an application is made by a local for any activity on the land.
“We will maintain a record of the revenue survey numbers of the lands from these villages falling under ESZ and verify their status whenever an application is made. Effectively, it will only be removed as an “entry” on the physical record document so that it clears the air.
Otherwise, it will still be mandatory for the locals to apply for necessary permissions before undertaking any activity on the lands, which will be scrutinised by the Local Monitoring Committee and approved by the state government. We are likely to receive the formal request from the DCF for the withdrawal of the ESZ status from revenue records soon,” he added.
On November 7, the mamlatdar (taluka head) of Garudeshwar taluka had issued the first notice to Gora village, located right across the Statue of Unity on the other side of the Narmada river from Kevadia, setting off a series of objections, protests, and opposition from tribal leaders across party lines.
The notice was based on a letter of the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), Narmada, dated January 21, 2020, which cited the May 2016 notification of the MoEFCC declaring an eco-sensitive zone around the Shooplaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, which has many species of animals and a total protected area is 60770.78 hectares. Of this, 3,184.13 hectares were diverted for the Sardar Sarovar Project dam in 1987.
As per the provisions of the said notification of the central government, land in the eco-sensitive zone — including that of the forest and horticulture departments, for agricultural use, and plots reserved for parks — will not be allowed to be transferred for non-agricultural use for commercial, industrial or residential purposes. Any lands, it sated, which needed to be transferred for non-agricultural use will require a mandatory approval from the state government, based on an application of a Local Monitoring Committee, to be set up to clear such applications.
A process was also initiated to include the state government as having “rights” on the lands in 121 villages.
The notice served to villages for the inclusion of the state government as having “rights” on the land in the Record of Rights prescribed under Village Form VII of the Land Revenue Records, had sparked protests. “Our protest was not against the eco-sensitive zone but the harassment it was causing the tribals due to such entries in records,” Motilal Vasava said.

Last week, Mansukh Vasava, in a letter to the Prime Minister, had cited the example of Rajasthan, where the notification for the eco-sensitive zone had been withdrawn in the “interest of farmers and locals”.
Vasava had said, “In the name of the notification of the MoEFCC, government officials have begun interfering in the private properties of the tribals. The local tribals in Narmada have not been taken into confidence or given the understanding of the issue, which has created fear and mistrust among them. The locals are preparing for protests and some opposition parties are leveraging on the lack of communication between the government and the locals, inciting them against the government.”"

The water-level in the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada, which has been steadily rising since August 11, may soon touch the Full Reservoir Level of 138.68 meters, officials estimate as the two dams upstream in Madhya Pradesh began releasing water on Monday.
The Indirasagar and Omkareshwar dams in Madhya Pradesh on Monday opened their 12 and 16 gates respectively to release water. With an inflow of over 6.8 lakh cusec into the Sardar Sarovar, the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) as a precaution cut back the level of the dam from 136.3 meters to 136.02 meters on Monday to ensure a safe balance even as the dam inches up to its FRL.
More than 40 villages along River Narmada around the Sardar Sarovar dam have been put on high alert after the inflow of water into the dam rose on Monday. With Madhya Pradesh’s Indirasagar and Omkareshwar dams opening their gates, the current outflow from Sardar Sarovar dam has been increased to 8 lakh cusec through its 23 open gates to maintain a balance.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
With the Sardar Sarovar’s riverbed and canal head powerhouses also operating at full capacity, the authorities are ensuring that the rise in the dam level is maintained at a balance as per protocol.
While officials say the dam may take at least a couple of days to reach the 136.68 metre FRL mark, provided that the inflow is the same, about 40 villages have been put on alert as the heavy flow downstream of the dam has resulted in a flood-like situation. Gora village on the other side of the Statue of Unity has been cut off due to the rising level of the river, which is flowing two metres above the lone bridge that joins the village to the district.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)
In May this year, the Gujarat Tourism Department released a video of popular tourist destinations in the state, urging people to “take a pause” to be able to “meet again and keep hope alive”, with tourist attractions closed during the Covid-19 lockdown.
However, with the onset of monsoon and the easing of lockdown, the Narmada district police is working overtime on weekends to chase away revellers driving down to Kevadia, which is home to the Statue of Unity, and its allied tourist spots, including the Zarwani waterfalls, a popular picnic spot during rain. Over the weekend, the police turned away over 150 cars that reached Kevadia despite restrictions at tourist destinations.
On Sunday, officials of the Kevadia police station guarding the Narmada Mata checkpoint, which is also the entry point into the Narmada Dam premises, where the Statue of Unity is located, turned away a 100 vehicles till afternoon. Police said they were prepared for the situation after seeing close to 50 vehicles arriving in Kevadia the previous weekend.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sub-inspector KK Pathak of Quick Response Team (QRT) Kevadia, which also mans the SoU, said, “Over a 100 vehicles came here on Sunday. We turned away about 60 vehicles on Saturday. We were expecting this rush of revellers as last weekend also saw about 60 vehicles coming in despite the tourist destinations being closed. When asked why were they visiting Kevadia without any purpose, they tried to find lame excuses. We let them off with a warning.”
Pathak said the revellers cannot be booked under any law at the moment. “Everyone is well aware that the tourist destinations are closed but driving to Kevadia is an outing in itself. Plus, some of them think that they can get an exterior view of the statue and try to make way to Zarwani waterfalls, which is a monsoon tourist spot. The problem is that since the government has allowed inter-district movement, we cannot book the people under any existing law if they are wearing masks, have not crowded the vehicle and are carrying all necessary documents,” Pathak said.
Police said there were people who came from as far as Surat, Bharuch, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. SoU and other tourist destinations in Gujarat have been closed since March 25."

They include Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh),Prithviraj Chavan (Maharashtra),Okram Ibobi Singh (Manipur) and Dr Mukul Sangma (Meghalaya),among others. 
In his letter,Modi has called upon his counterparts to deliberate on the issue,take up the matter with the Central government and oppose this Bill. 
Modi wrote that it was important for all Chief Ministers to rise beyond political affiliations and come together to oppose the Bill which,he maintained,was nothing,but a blatant attempt by the Centre to interfere with and intrude upon the powers of elected state governments.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi argued that the Bill would polarise society on religious and linguistic lines and would introduce the idea of differential application of criminal law to citizens based on religious and linguistic identities. He wrote that the Bill would demoralise public savants and even affect the way the state government can deal with law and order situations in future.
On Thursday,Modi had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,expressing his strong opposition to the Bill. He had described the Bill as ill-conceived and a recipe for disaster.  He had added that it was driven by votebank politics,not genuine concern for the society at large.
Gujarat delegates meet Assam CM to seek support for Sardar statue
Press Trust of India
Guwahati,Dec 6
A 17-member delegation from Gujarat,comprising MPs,MLAs and officials,met Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi to seek state governments support for erecting a statue of the countrys first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the banks of Narmada river.
The delegation,led by Gujarat Minister for Social Justice,Empowerment and Youth Culture Ramanlal Vora,called on Gogoi on Thursday night and apprised him about the ambitious project taken up by Gujarat Government to erect a giant statue of Sardar Patel measuring 182 metres in height.
Vora said that it was apt that iron be collected from different parts of the country for the Statue of Unity as Sardar Vallabhbhai was known as the Loha Purush (Iron Man) of India.
Gogoi while extending his governments support for the project,pointed out that Sardar Patel did not belong to Gujarat alone but to the whole country.

The viewing gallery of the Statue of Unity that came under severe criticism from tourists after rainwater entering the area and forming puddles during the first heavy showers of the season, will soon be enclosed. As an emergency measure, the management has decided to cover the area with aluminium sheets, which would obstruct the view from the gallery.
Officials say remodeling the facade of the gallery is the only way to keep it dry during monsoon. JN Singh, Gujarat Chief Secretary and SVPRET member, said, “A glass enclosure was the original idea. But we went with an open gallery as per the suggestion of the designer. However, we are open to turning it into an enclosure again and we will consider glass or other options as well.”
With the onset of monsoon in June, the viewing gallery of the world’s tallest statue that stands at 182 metres made news for puddles and water dripping from the ceiling. Tourists who visited the gallery circulated videos, expressing their disappointment. Officials initially stated that rainwater would enter the gallery that left open for tourists to enjoy the view of the Narmada dam and the Vindhya mountain range. However, excessive criticism from tourists forced the management to take remedial measures.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


	ExplainedTasks to be undertaken on priorityAs the first anniversary of the Statue of Unity comes up in October, the site is set to host several conferences, including one of the Union Cabinet and the Ministry of External Affairs as well as a conference of probationary officers of the civil services to be addressed by PM Modi. Officials have therefore been prompt in fixing shortcomings brought to their notice, and promoting the site on social media. In October, the PM is set to launch 30 projects linked to the statue. Therefore, addressing teething problems, including a leaking gallery, has become a priority for the government. 

According to officials, the SVPRET, which manages the Statue of Unity, has invited design suggestions to close the gallery while keeping the aesthetics in mind.
“Initially, there was a proposal to make the gallery an air-conditioned glass enclosure. But the design team decided to leave it open for tourists to enjoy the natural weather from that height. So, only the part of the gallery behind the statue was enclosed with glass while the gallery at the chest was left open. What was not anticipated was the trouble tourists would face during rains. We received several complaints from tourists who got drenched as rainwater entered the gallery during the downpour. So a rethink was necessary,” an official in the know said.
The gallery, located at 153 metres, gives tourists a view of the breadth of the Narmada Dam. Officials also said that while a glass enclosure could be one option, the team is also exploring other ways to protect it from rain. “A formal proposal to cover the gallery will be made after taking into account other factors as it should not affect the design. Most certainly, the aluminium sheets cannot be a permanent solution,” the official said."

The session was moderated by Senior Assistant Editor Avishek G Dastidar
NITIN GADKARI: The most important development for the country is infrastructure development… In my office in Delhi, we have put up a statement by former American President John F Kennedy: ‘American roads are not good because America is rich. But America is rich because American roads are good.’ Prosperity comes from roads. India has a huge potential for infrastructure development. We have the potential of making at least 300 airports. We have already completed 100 new airports. We can launch seaplanes. The service is already available in Gujarat at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue (Statue of Unity in Kevadia in Narmada district) … And, we can convert our rivers, lakes and dams into water ports. This is going to encourage tourism, and will go on to provide employment….
ANANT GOENKA: When will India see large-scale production of electric vehicles (EVs)?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
NITIN GADKARI: Already a lot of people, small companies are making e-bikes and e-scooters in Uttar Pradesh and other states in India. The crucial problem with EVs is the lithium-ion battery. Now, we are encouraging people to make in India and ‘Made in India’. The important thing is that a lot of research is going on to make aluminium-ion (batteries) and other new alternatives. I am confident that in some time we will get a lot of new alternatives, and soon EVs will be the future of the country.

Already there is a lot of sale of electric buses, like in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur etc. They are there at airports too. Even an electric tractor is now in the process of being manufactured. One of the leading companies wants to launch an electric truck. Just 20 days ago, I launched a JCB on CNG. So, a lot of change is going on and we are a hundred per cent certain that it will be a very cost-effective import substitute, and will also be pollution-free and indigenous. We are already in the process of making (vehicle) scrapping policy. With the scrapping policy, I am confident that in the next five years India will be the number one manufacturing hub in the world.
Tesla is preparing to start operations in India by early 2021. I am sure that there are a lot of EVs which are equal to Tesla from the technology point of view. Indian manufacturers are doing a lot of research and changes. In due course, you will get electric cars which will be equal to Tesla. I am confident of that, and the cost will be very less too.
ANANT GOENKA: Lithium-ion is mostly being imported from China. Is that a concern?
NITIN GADKARI: Yes, there are some problems related to lithium-ion. Argentina has got huge reserves of lithium-ion. Indian players are also trying to get lithium-ion from across the world. But it is also true that the Chinese have already picked up stakes in a majority of the lithium-ion mines… But our research arm is fully competent. Take for example ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), which is using different types of batteries to send satellites. Research is going on and our people are competent and we will get the solution for that.
Sodium-ion batteries are also in the process of being made. The research is in the final stages. I am very confident about our IITs and engineers. We will get success in this field. The sodium-ion batteries are very cheap… We will be the number one manufacturers of electric bikes, scooters, tractors, trucks, and even electric construction equipment in due course.
AMITABH SINHA: While the infrastructure in India — roads, railways, Metro etc — has improved in the last three decades, we are among the last countries to have developed these. Are we now building infrastructure that is futuristic?
NITIN GADKARI: It is true that our railway stations are not of a global standard. But we are building a multi-modal station worth Rs 1,200 crore in Nagpur. It has been designed by an American architect. It will be among the five best railway stations in the world. So, things have begun to happen slowly.
The cost of building the Metro in Nagpur, Pune and Delhi is Rs 350 crore per kilometre. The one that I have proposed costs Rs 5 crore per kilometre (the Nagpur broad gauge Metro) … Using the existing railway stations, lines and signals, the broad-gauge, six-coach Metro will run at a speed of 160 km per hour. We have already got the permission… Of the six coaches, three will have motors, and will cost Rs 8 crore. The coaches without a motor will cost Rs 4 crore. There will be an additional coach for carrying luggage. While a luxury bus from Nagpur to Amravati takes about two-and-a-half hours, this Metro will reach in one hour and 15 minutes… It will be air-conditioned and will also have business and economy classes. It will be of a global standard. So, it’s not that the standard in India is not good…
Read |MSP as legal provision will lead to loss for Punjab farmers: BJP leader
I have prepared a new model for this project. I am holding a meeting with the Vidarbha Industries Association and the Metro team in a few days. I have also invited travel and tourism companies for the meeting. One Metro will cost Rs 36 crore. These private companies can buy one or two Metros. The Nagpur Metro will provide the driver… If this service becomes popular, people will stop using the road. This is Nagpur’s first public-private investment. The system will use the country’s existing broad gauge, and the capital cost will also be less. So, we are doing things which are of an international standard, and some of these projects are also being done for the first time in the world.
AVISHEK G DASTIDAR: Farmers have been holding protests at Delhi’s borders for over a month now. How do you think the government can resolve their issues? 
NITIN GADKARI: Firstly, at one point we had a shortage of foodgrains in the country. Then, after the Green Revolution, we now have surplus rice. Prior to 2020’s production, we had about 280 lakh tonnes of rice in our godowns. We can give rice to the entire world. In case of corn, the MSP is Rs 1,700, when the market price is about Rs 1,100. Last year, we exported 60 lakh tonnes of sugar, providing a subsidy of Rs 600 crore. Why is it that the cost of sugar in the international market is Rs 22 per kg but we are paying Rs 34 per kg for sugarcane? Our MSP is more than the international and market prices, and that is the problem.
I have been talking about ethanol for the last 12 years. But the permission to convert foodgrains (to fuel) was not granted. We import fuel worth Rs 8 lakh crore. We can make 480 litres of ethanol from 1 tonne of rice. From 1 tonne of corn, we can make 380 litres of ethanol. The economy of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh will be transformed. And, instead of making sugar, we could make ethanol from sugarcane juice and molasses… As Transport Minister, I have launched scooters and bikes of Bajaj and TVS which run on ethanol… A lot of products are made from ethanol including bio-plastic (which is biodegradable). Ethanol is a green fuel… If we can build this economy, our farmers can earn more. It could help in reducing import (of fuel) by Rs 2 lakh crore, and pollution will also reduce. And, Rs 1 lakh crore will go to farmers… The root cause of the problem is surplus foodgrains and higher MSP than the market price.
At a pharmacy, the shopkeeper decides the price (of the products). The price of an advertisement in the newspaper is decided by the newspaper. The cost of food in a restaurant is decided by the restaurant… The airline companies and the railways decide the price of their tickets. Then why should farmers not decide the price (of their produce)? Farmers should be able to sell anywhere they want, wherever they get more money. We have not closed down any APMC.
Another important aspect is contract farming. About 10,000 farmers in the Vidarbha region don’t have capital and their land is lying barren. This is compelling them to commit suicide. If a third person tills the land, buys the seed and fertiliser, and then shares the profit, or leases the land, the farmer still gets some money… When we ride a taxi for half an hour, do we become its owner? In contract farming, no change is going to be made in the revenue record. So, the farm laws are not against farmers… We have to understand the problems faced by farmers… The government has no place to store foodgrains. Diversification of agriculture towards the energy and power sector, changing the crop pattern, increasing production of edible oils is necessary for the country.
DEEPTIMAN TIWARY: During certain months in the year, there is not enough water in the waterway from Varanasi to Haldia (in West Bengal). It’s a concern for ships. How do you plan to resolve this for making waterways?
NITIN GADKARI: …For rivers which don’t have water in March and April, we are working on water conservation projects. Such work has been done in Maharashtra. We are ensuring waterways only on two rivers, which will have water round the year… Apart from this, it is also important to develop port-related infrastructure such as godowns, cold storage facilities, railway line connectivity. Now we can send mangoes from Uttar Pradesh to the Northeast. The fly ash in Farakka (West Bengal) is exported to Bangladesh in large quantities. The aim is to develop the trade business and increase connectivity….
In the case of seaplanes, we are looking for investors. A few of them are approaching us… SpiceJet is interested in taking about 100 seaplanes.
SHUBHANGI KHAPRE: Do you think it was right to cancel the Winter Session of Parliament?
NITIN GADKARI: In the previous session, a few members got Covid-19, including me. So, I think it had to be postponed. Delhi has pollution as well as Covid-19. Although I am keeping well, I am afraid of Delhi pollution… In such a situation, while a Parliament session is important for democracy… We have also lost a few ministerial colleagues. Till a vaccine is out, we should be careful.
TABASSUM BARNAGARWALA: Overcrowding has been a problem on Mumbai’s local trains. Has the ongoing pandemic led to any discussion on the need for more local trains in Mumbai to ensure social distancing?
NITIN GADKARI: My personal view is that we must continue all services with preventive measures. We shut down shops, restaurants… On the one hand it was necessary to ensure social distancing, but now as the Minister for Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), I understand how people lost their livelihoods in the process. We now need to understand the art of living with Covid-19 — wearing masks and face shields, using sanitiser, washing hands, ensuring one metre distance from other people, sitting apart at restaurants. We need to understand these things and move forward. Shutting things down has many disadvantages.
In Mumbai, we can decide how many people will get on a train. We have good technology now, and numbers can be restricted. But everything needs to start, whether it is trains or buses, and at the same time we need to protect ourselves and others. People such as tea stall owners, barbers, gym instructors, all lost their source of income. Their livelihood is as important as taking precautions for Covid-19. I conducted 280 conferences and met 80 crore people. I learnt that the hotel industry employs 1.4 crore people as chefs and waiters. Over one crore people work in beauty parlours and hair salons. We need to protect their jobs too.
SANDEEP SINGH: To help lockdown-battered MSMEs get back on their feet, the government launched the over Rs 3 lakh crore emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) as part of the AtmaNirbhar Bharat package in May. But till November, the sanction was short by Rs 1 lakh crore and disbursement was also below 50 per cent. The MSMEs are feeling the stress. What is the way forward?
NITIN GADKARI: …We had sanctioned Rs 3 lakh crore for collateral-free loans for MSMEs. Of this, Rs 2 lakh crore has been sanctioned, and disbursement stands between Rs 1.6-1.8 lakh crore… I have requested the Finance Minister to give more relaxations in the scheme. Also, we found that urban cooperative banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also financed MSMEs. So they too must be brought under the scheme. That will help too.
We had also given Rs 20,000 crore for distressed MSMEs. We have restructured (debts of) around six lakh MSMEs under it. We also announced a ‘fund of funds’ for MSMEs to provide equity support of Rs 50,000 crore. We are processing it. The MSMEs which have good export turnover, tax return, GST and bank records… Now if such MSMEs want to tap the capital market, we will provide them with 15 per cent equity infusion and the rest they can get from the market. So in the insurance , pension, and share economy, we have a lot of potential in comparison to other countries. And some of our MSMEs are doing very well.
Of the total exports by the country, MSMEs account for 48 per cent. Their contribution to the GDP is 30 per cent. I want the 48 per cent export figure to reach 60 per cent and GDP contribution to become 40 per cent. MSMEs have created 11 crore jobs, and in the coming time we want them to create five crore more jobs.
The market needs liquidity. I want to request the banks to adopt a liberal approach to financing people, which will increase liquidity, growth, employment, export… So we are monitoring all aspects. We have created a portal called ‘Champion’ and we are addressing all problems raised by the MSME sector on it.
SANDEEP SINGH: Will Tesla come to manufacture in India?
NITIN GADKARI: It’s better to talk about it when they come. India is going to be an automobile manufacturing hub in five years. The industry is worth Rs 4.5 lakh crore and gives the maximum employment… And, bio-fuel, ethanol, methanol, bio-CNG, bio-diesel, electric… research is underway on all these in India. In the coming time, all the big world brands will come here… (Tesla) will begin sales operations, not manufacturing. Once the sales increase, they will move to assembling, and then manufacturing.
VANDITA MISHRA: Do you think the farmers’ protest could have been handled in a better manner by the government. The protests began in June in Punjab and Haryana, but the government only took note once these reached the Capital. Also, has the split with the Akali Dal made the situation more difficult to handle?
NITIN GADKARI: We are constantly making efforts to hold talks… A lot of confusion has been created about the three farm laws. We were ready for talks then (in June) too… Even in Parliament we were open to talks with other parties, and we are ready to talk now as well. I am positive that the issue will get resolved soon through talks.
The BJP-Akali Dal alliance has been there since the Jana Sangh days. During the Emergency, leaders of both parties were in jail. We have had good relations with them, and the alliance was a symbol of Hindu-Sikh unity. It is unfortunate that they left us. All I want to say is that our government has taken many decisions in favour of farmers. We are not against them… We are increasing the MSP every year… The government is working for farmers’ benefit. Now, I am not the BJP president, so I don’t want to comment on the politics. But I want things to work out and our relations to get better soon.
MANOJ C G: Many BJP-ruled are drafting laws against love jihad. Should the State decide who one can marry or fall in love with? 
NITIN GADKARI: There are two sides to all issues. As per my knowledge, many incidents have happened which have triggered the issue of love jihad. To maintain law and order and ensure a healthy society if a state government feels the need for such a law, there is no harm in it. It is not against any religion. Central and state governments have the right to create laws to address certain issues in society.

AVISHEK G DASTIDAR: In the MSME and the highways space, you have been making policies vis-a-vis AtmaNirbhar Bharat, to ensure that influence of Chinese players is less in the market. Can you elaborate on your policies?
NITIN GADKARI: I don’t want to say anything about China. We increased the import duty on incense sticks. It is a Rs 4,000 crore industry. Now it is being developed in our country. Over 25 lakh people got jobs. Sanitiser was not available, it was being sold for Rs 1,200/litre, now it is available at Rs 160/litre. We are exporting PPE kits… I told the automobile sector to not get parts from China or any other country, and develop local vendors. Give them machines, money and produce on a large scale to reduce costs…
The mindset of major industry players has changed. Technology is being upgraded, foreign investment is coming to our country, and India is being preferred in the global market. It is a golden opportunity for us."

The party’s “commitment” to abrogate Article 370, he said, has allowed Kashmiri women to now marry men from “other parts of India” without the fear of losing share in their property.
Campaigning at Karamsad in Anand district ahead of the upcoming local body polls, Paatil said, “When the BJP manifesto mentioned the party would repeal Article 370, Congress warned Modi not to touch 370… They said, ‘Kashmir mein khoon ki nadiyaan beh jayengi (Kashmir will see rivers of blood flowing)’. But this is Modiji from Gujarat, he does not fear anyone. He went to the Rajya Sabha, and in one day, he introduced a Bill and got it cleared in both Houses within a day… This is the Modi-(Amit) Shah government, they take responsibility to ensure the law and order after a decision (is made)… When the task was entrusted to Amit Shah, could there have been ‘khoon ki nadiyaan’? Amit Shah ensured not even a bullet was fired in the Valley.”

Paatil said the repealing of the Article 370 has given Kashmiri women the freedom to choose to marry in other part of the country. “Earlier, a woman from Kashmir, if she married any man from outside the state, she would lose the rights to her property because of Article 370. Now, imagine the happiness of the women because with the revoking of the Article 370, they can marry anyone and not lose rights to their property in their state.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Paatil also evoked Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was born in Karamsad. “Karamsad is Sardar Patel’s Janmabhoomi (birth place) but his karmabhoomi (place of work) is in Bardoli, which is my area. I invite you to visit there. Like you, we too are proud of being connected to the great leader. In Bardoli, we have even kept the room where he stayed untouched,” Paatil said.
Taking a dig at the Congress for criticising the Modi government over its decision to build the Statue of Unity (SoU) in Kevadia, Paatil said, “Today, you see the grand 182-metre-high statue in Kevadia, attracting people from all over the world… When I visited New York last year, I went to see the Statue of Liberty, which is such a well-known monument. But honestly, I saw it from the boat ride and did not feel like visiting it… It was a mere ornamental statue. But SoU is an inspiration.”
The BJP leader said farmers who contributed iron farm tools for the Statue of Unity in 2014 feel “involved” in the project, a cornerstone of Modi’s ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ dream.
He also criticised the Congress for attacking the BJP over the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “Congress would say that ‘BJP wale bolenge mandir wahin banayenge, par tareekh nahi batayenge’ (BJP will speak of building the temple but not announce the date), but when Modiji became the Prime Minister, the court order came… Under the Congress regime, there would be communal clashes, hatred spread and the construction of the temple would be obstructed. Now, Modiji has brought people from every community and region together for construction of the temple.”
Paatil said the fund collection drive for the temple is not due to the necessity of gathering money but instilling the feeling of ‘oneness’.

Citing the BJP had 1.14 crore party workers in the state, the highest that any political party can ever dream of having, Paatil urged the workers to enrol 10 new beneficiaries in the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to mark their respective birthdays.
Roadshow in Ahmedabad
Earlier in the day, Paatil led a roadshow in Ahmedabad city before the campaigning for the polls for the municipal corporations ended. Starting from Kubernagar ward in the morning, the roadshow passed through 23-km distance of the city to culminate at Kamnath Mahadev near Raipur Crossroads.
Paatil was accompanied by senior party leaders Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Kaushik Patel, I K Jadeja, Jagdish Panchal, Pradeepsinh Vaghela and others in a ‘chariot’ (truck) which was welcomed by people at more than 30 locations on the route.

An official release stated that the chariot was preceded by party workers riding horses and elephants with great enthusiasm.

The Statue of Unity is taking shape in Kevadia, Gujarat, nearly four years since then chief minister Narendra Modi had laid its foundation stone on October 31, 2013.
The statue, of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, has so far been erected up to the knees — 59 metres tall, at 117 m above sea level — out of a planned 182 m, to match the number of assembly constituencies in Gujarat. By September, workers from TQ Art Foundry of Jiangxi Tongqing Company in Nanchang, China, will arrive in Kevadia to assist in assembling the bronze cladding of the façade.
For the core, the framework is a mixture of concrete and steel. For the cladding, TQ Art Foundry has designed about 5,000 bronze panels under the supervision of artist Ram Suthar. These will be assembled in a workshop before being clad to complete the façade in phases. The TQ Art Foundry workshop has completed precasting the feet and the dhoti for the first stage and these will arrive in India in a few weeks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Thousands of high quality prototypes of precast façade will be shipped in from China and assembled at the site,” said R G Kanungo, superintending engineer of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL). “Simultaneously, the steel framework that will give the exterior shape and hold the bronze cladding together will be shipped in from Trichy, where it is being manufactured. Close to 100 workers from China will arrive and work on the cladding. By then, the height of the statue will be at 90 metres, almost halfway through.”
The contract for the steel framework has been given to Malaysia-based Eversendai, which lists Dubai’s famous highrises Burj al-Arab and Burj Khalifa among its projects.
On site, SSNNL officials say, close to 2,400 workers are at work on day and night shifts. “Currently, we are constructing the core wall, the RCC spine of the statue — on which steel frames will be affixed to hold the bronze cladding together,” Kanungo said. “We have also completed construction of the drum wall. Shortly, we will construct a coupling wall to add rigidity and connect the cores. These concentric concrete cores will house elevators and stairways.”
The biggest challenge has been the wind. “So many times, the workers have to pause the construction to allow the wind to calm down. However, we calculated that delay in the overall project deadline,” Kanungo said.
The core will rise to 157 m, forming Sardar Patel’s body up to his chest. This is where the viewing gallery will be set up. Under the original plan, visitors were to travel to the height of the head with the gallery through the statue’s eyes. Engineers have, however, decided now it is not feasible.
During his Lok Sabha poll campaign, Modi had announced collection of farm tools from across India for the construction to represent the “unified India” that Sardar Patel stood for. NGO Citizens for Accountable Governance designed and rolled out the outreach and social mobilisation plan, while the drive was launched by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust, a special purpose vehicle headed by the Gujarat CM.
After deliberation about the apparent non-usability of the scrap collected, “we have used about 109 tonnes of iron to create the reinforced beams… as per the vision of PM Modi to use metal from across India,” said Kanungo. “We were able to extract 109 tonnes from about 135 tonnes of scrap that was processed.”"

Under Pressure
Wth Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily refusing to yield to his party colleagues’ wish to increase the cap on subsidised LPG cylinders from 9 to 12 per household per annum, Congress leaders have decided to mount further pressure on him. A delegation of Congress MPs including Sanjay Nirupam, P C Chacko, Sandeep Dikshit, Pratap Singh Bajwa and Mahabal Mishra will meet Moily on Friday to demand an enhancement in the cooking gas cylinders’ quota. According to Nirupam, he along with other parliamentarians would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi to seek her intervention if the Petroleum Minister does not concede. The issue of LPG cylinders’ quota had earlier been raised by senior party leader Ambika Soni at the recent meeting of party chief ministers. Official sources said Moily is not in a mood to oblige his party colleagues as of now.

Eyes on Mahatma      
After Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi Thursday dropped hints to corner Congress over  the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. While Modi appealed to NRIs at Pravasi Bhartiya Divas to spread a word about his “Statue of Unity” project to commemorate Sardar Patel among Indian diaspora across the world, the BJP leader suggested the need to commemorate the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s return from South Africa next year in a befitting manner. While Union minister Vyalar Ravi patiently heard his suggestion, the prime ministerial hopeful went on to offer that Gujarat would be ready to host the next edition of Pravasi Bhartiya Divas to mark the centenary celebration of Mahatma’s return to India."

(File)
A DAY before the first batch of Union ministers arrived in J&K as part of an outreach initiative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the Council of Ministers Friday that those visiting the UT should refrain from overt political messaging and focus on connecting with the people to “make up for lost time”, sources told The Indian Express.
According to the sources, the Prime Minister also asked the Ministers to stay in the villages they visit at night rather than return to Jammu or Srinagar.
Friday’s meeting was the latest in a series that Modi has held with Ministers and top bureaucrats to chalk out a five-year vision for the government. Ten groups of secretaries have made presentations on the way forward.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Addressing the bureaucrats Friday, sources quoted the Prime Minister as saying that if all files in the government moved at the same pace as those pertaining to foreign visits, the government “would be in a good place”.
He also suggested inclusion of the Statue of Unity among iconic tourism sites in the country and asked for focus on security as one of the parameters of ease of doing business, sources said.

“The PM specifically told the Ministers who will be visiting J&K that there should not be any political colour to the visit. The idea should not be to do politics but to connect with the people — youth, teachers, government officers — and try to win them over. He emphasised on winning hearts and minds so that the government can work with them to make up for lost time,” said sources who were present in the meeting.
“He also said that Ministers should spend the nights in some of the villages they visit rather than come back to Jammu or Srinagar every night,” they said.
The first group of Ministers, comprising Jitendra Singh, Ashwani Choubey and Arjun Meghwal, arrived in J&K Saturday. As part of the outreach following the abrogation of Article 370, 36 Union Ministers are scheduled to visit the UT in batches over the next few weeks.
Meanwhile, referring to ease of doing business, the Prime Minister reminded bureaucrats of the importance of fast clearances. “He told bureaucrats that if all files are cleared at the pace at which foreign tour files are cleared, the government would be in a good place. Normally, foreign tour files see five of six signatures completed in one day,” sources said.
The Prime Minister also underlined the importance of security in ease of doing business and tourism. The meeting discussed the fact that despite having, along with China, the highest number of UNESCO heritage sites, the tourist influx has not been as per expectations.
“The PM wanted the Statue of Unity to be included among the 17 iconic sites. Several Ministers suggested that they should schedule meetings with international dignitaries near the site in Kewadiya Colony (near Vadodara) to make the statue an international destination,” said sources.
The meetings of the Council of Ministers to discuss the roadmap started from January 3, with the Prime Minister initially expressing “displeasure” at the lack of big ticket ideas and the tendency to look at the government functioning in silos."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the institution of a new national honour for national unity on the pattern of Padma Awards, an official statement said on Sunday.
The annual award will be given to an Indian who has contributed to national unity in any manner, it said, adding that the PM drew inspiration from Sardar Patel’s contribution towards unification of the country.
The announcement was made at the just-concluded annual conference of Director Generals of Police and Inspector Generals of Police held at Kevadiya in Narmada district of Gujarat, near the statue of Sardar Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi also released a commemorative postal stamp on the National Police Memorial and a special issue of Indian Police Journal on police martyrdom, published by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, it said.
The PM also suggested that a national-level parade be organised by police forces of about three to four states near the Statue of Unity every year on Patel’s birthday — October 31. This day is observed as National Unity Day.
Modi launched the website of the Cyber Coordination Centre, which will be a one-stop shop on all cyber-related issues. The centre will act as a bridge between law enforcement agencies on the one hand, and academia and private cyber-security professionals on the other, the statement said.
The three-day conference focused on improving cyber security and preparing police forces to prevent and investigate cyber crimes and financial fraud.
According to the statement, it was Patel, who as home minister inaugurated the first conference of Inspector Generals of Police in Delhi in 1948. So Patel’s message of national unity was the underlying theme of this year’s conference, it said.
Modi emphasised that coordination of Central Armed Police Forces and central agencies with state police forces and among neighbouring states was essential for successfully dealing with complex issues of crime prevention, it said. He advised DGPs to make imaginative use of information technology to reach out to all sections of society."

The BJP on Thursday distanced itself from Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy’s remarks suggesting the boycott of Kashmir and Kashmiris in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack and said the party did not agree with his views.
While speaking to reporters in the national capital, Union Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “I don’t agree with his tweet. Matter ends there.”
Prasad’s reaction came a day after Roy supported a retired Army officer’s suggestion to boycott Kashmir and Kashmiris economically. “An appeal from a retired Colonel of the Indian Army: Don’t visit Kashmir, don’t go to Amarnath for the next 2 years. Don’t buy articles from Kashmir emporia or Kashmiri tradesman who come every winter. Boycott everything Kashmiri. I am inclined to agree,” the Meghalaya Governor had posted on Twitter.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
His remarks drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders like former Union minister P Chidambaram and former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.
Referring to the Statue of Unity, the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel built near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat, Chidambaram took a dig at Roy saying, “The Statue of Unity watches over the Governor of Meghalaya and others who seem to think that Kashmiris have no place in India.”
Abdullah had said: “People like Tathagata want Kashmir but without Kashmiris. They’d sooner see us driven into the sea. He’ll be best placed to know he can’t have one without the other so what’s it to be?”
Mufti demanded Roy’s immediate removal. “Deplorable statement coming from the Governor of Meghalaya. GoI must sack him immediately. If they fail to do so, it means he has their tacit approval and are using it as an election ploy to polarise the situation,” she said.

In Gujarat, Patels are the richest farmers and landowners and have been BJP voters since the 1980s. And the campaign to build a 182-metre (the number coincides with the strength of Gujarat’s MLAs) statue aimed to consolidate the Patels under the BJP umbrella. However, the project is moving at a slow pace, with the contributions (iron) from farmers being far from encouraging.
Just before the 2012 Assembly elections, Gujarat saw a huge anti-Modi rebellion in the Leuva sub-sect of the Patel community, especially after Keshubhai Patel, seen as one of its tallest leaders, quit the BJP to launch his own Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) and jump into the electoral battle.
However, the rebellion in this politically influential community fizzled out by the time Modi was announced Prime Ministerial candidate by the BJP in September 2013. When he laid the foundation for the Statue of Unity at Sardar Sarovar Dam in October 2013, the top ministers in Modi’s new government were all Patels, indicating the weight this community wields in Gujarat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The rebellion, which began with Modi replacing his predecessor Keshubhai Patel in the course of ten years, had resulted into many Leuva Patel leaders parting ways with the BJP. But all of them — including Gordhan Zadaphia who quit the BJP in 2008 to launch his own party — are back in the BJP now.
Unlike in the 2012 Assembly elections, the Leuva Patels’ powerful Saurashtra-based religious body, Shree Khodaldham Trust, which supported the GPP-led proxy anti-Modi campaign, has gone totally silent. In the run-up to the 2012 Assembly elections, it had sent negative signals to Modi through three mega show-of-strength events. “We never had problems with the BJP. The dissent was against Modi. The Patels parted ways, assuming that the BJP will take some action against Modi. But by now everyone has realised that Modi is the future of the party and there is no point in remaining divided,” argued a senior Patel leader, who has recently come back to the BJP.
With the GPP having merged with the BJP, and the rival Kadva sect of Patels already with Modi, LS seats like Jamnagar, Rajkot and Porbandar in Saurashtra, Mehsana in north Gujarat and Anand and Kheda in central Gujarat, are set to swing by Patel votes.
The Kadvas and Leuvas faced the prospect of pulling in different directions when Keshubhai raised the banner of injustice to Patidars and formed the GPP in the run-up to the 2012 Assembly elections. The octogenarian had made speeches from the platform of Khodaldham Trust. But the leaders of both sections say that is past now.
Besides, at least seven Patel leaders of Congress in Saurashtra and Kutch have crossed over to the BJP.
The trend was set in February 2013, when Leuva strongman and Porbandar MP Vitthal Radadiya and his MLA son Jayesh donned the saffron scarf. This was followed by the defection of Bavku Undhad, the Congress MLA from Lathi. Both were the political face for Khodaldham Trust.
Keshubhai’s son Bharat, too, returned to the BJP fold before his father resigned as an MLA of Visavadar in Junagadh district, citing age and health problems. He also hinted at the merger of GPP with the BJP. Zadaphia, another Leuva who was once a minister in the Modi Cabinet and who had taken over as the GPP president after Keshubhai retired, announced the merger of his party with the BJP on February 24. The latest name in this series was Chhabil Patel, the Congress MLA from Abdasa in Kutch, also a Leuva.
Radadiya is fighting the Porbandar Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket while Undhad and Chhabil are seeking reelection as BJP nominees from their respective Assembly seats. Bharat is claiming the legacy of his father’s Visavadar seat. “These crossovers have hardly left anything for Patidars to vote for the Congress. Where is a Patidar leader in Congress for the community to vote? The likes of Keshubhai, Zadaphia, Radadiya have left it,” says Jairam Vanjaliya, vice-president of Shri Umiya Mataji Mandir Trust, Sidsar, a social organisation of Kadva patidars of Saurashtra.
Hansraj Gajera, secretary of Shree Khodaldham Trust, Kagvad, the social organisation of Leuvas, concedes the general inclination of the community has been towards the BJP. Vanjaliya says he had held a meeting with Khodaldham Trust president Naresh Patel — who campaigned in favour of Unghad and Keshubhai in 2012 — a week ago and there was a general sentiment to vote for the BJP. Going one step further, Dr Dahyabhai Patel, president of Umiya Trust, says, “We are making efforts to string Leuvas and Kadvas together. We are planning to make a start with building an all-Patidar educational institute in Gandhinagar.”
However, Dr Patel says he is not very sure about the results. “While the general mood is in favour of the BJP, it is possible results might not be as expected. The new generation thinks independently and wants a stable, new government,” he adds."

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Statue Location, Height, Cost: The much-anticipated inauguration of the ‘Statue of Unity’- a monument to commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is scheduled for Wednesday. The date for the inauguration of the statue is chosen to be October 31 as it happens to be the 143rd birth anniversary of the national icon, who is fondly remembered as the ‘Iron Man of India’, for his role in the unification of princely states after the independence from the British.
The statue stands on Sadhu island on the Narmada in Gujarat. The Statue of Unity, which stands 182-metre tall, dwarfs New York’s Statue of Liberty by twice its size and almost four times the height of Brazil’s Christ the Redeemer. The number ‘182’ was a conscious choice representing the 182 Assembly constituencies of Gujarat. The total cost of the project is said to be Rs 2,989 crores. From sea level, the height would be 237.35 metres — the 70-metre hillock of Sadhu Bet having been flattened to 55 metres to lay the foundation.

State health department officials appear to be embarrassed by the high number of cases of dengue being reported in Gujarat and seem to have resorted to comparing weekly percentage change to soften the blow. A press note from the state government mentioning a “35% decline in dengue cases”, came without the mention of the base number or period of comparison. The department remains hesitant to share exact numbers, saying, “When we give numbers, it goes as headline without a context and it looks very bad for our department and goes on to lower our morale…Anyway weekly comparison is the appropriate way to assess if the control measures that we are taking, is effective or not.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

THE GUJARAT government, through Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), submitted to the Gujarat High Court (HC) Friday that it would check and submit to the court on Monday, if it has any alternative plot to offer, after land owners in Narmada district moved the division bench at the Gujarat HC, challenging the eviction notice sent to them on September 4.
The notice had sought that the petitioners vacate the plots allotted to them within 30 days, to make way for parking spaces in view of the increase of tourists at the Statue of Unity (SoU) situated near the said plots.
Heard by the division bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath, the petitioners — Arjunsinh Solanki and Sahdevsinh Solanki, who run a dhaba on the purportedly disputed plot — have sought a stay on the eviction notice in their petition.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
To this effect, pending the government’s reply, the court has ordered against any coercive action in the interim, asking the government to not evict the petitioners, said Counsel B M Mangukiya, who is representing the petitioners.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
A single judge bench at the HC had rejected the maintainability of the petition on Tuesday. It reasoned, “..the final notice dated 04.09.2019 is issued by the respondent Corporation (SSNNL) pursuant to the clause no. 15 of the lease­ deed, which prescribes that whenever there is requirement by the respondent ­Corporation by giving one month’s notice, the plots can be vacated by terminating the lease…it is also pertinent to note that the petitioners already filed a regular civil suit, which is withdrawn on the ground of settlement arrived at outside the court between the parties. Therefore, now, the petitioners cannot raise the dispute with regard to invoking the provisions of the Act, so as to continue in the premises which were allotted to the petitioners pursuant to the lease agreement between the parties in view of contractual agreement between parties.”"

Denouncing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks that the Congress was levelling baseless allegations against “the son of Gujarat”, the opposition party on Tuesday said he was making emotional statements to run away from discussions on failed promises. If he was strong, he should have called the winter session of Parliament and faced questions, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
“Why cannot we challenge the PM in Gujarat, just because he is from Gujarat?” Sharma sought to know. “He (Modi) visits Uttar Pradesh and abuses (Samajwadi Party leader) Akhilesh Yadav, goes to Bihar and abuses (RJD chief) Lalu Yadav, insults Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh,” he alleged while talking to reporters. “We are not insulting you but should we also not ask any questions?” Sharma said.
Modi, during a rally in Gujarat on Monday, attacked the Congress, saying the opposition party leaders were hurling baseless allegations at the “son of Gujarat”. Sharma claimed that Modi had “no tolerance and democratic mindset”, which is why he said so. “Your (Modi’s) big promises have turned out to be a lie and you are running away from discussions and only making false emotional statements,” the Congress leader charged.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sharma claimed that Modi “hates truth and often lies”. “He is loud, but not strong. If he was strong, he should have called the winter session of Parliament and faced questions,” he said. Sharma also said he had sent a book to the PM, titled ‘Journey of the Nation’, which details the 125 years of history of the Congress so that Modi could put history in perspective.
In response to Modi’s allegations that the Congress insulted Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, he said the ‘Iron Man’ was among the country’s greatest leaders and freedom fighters. “He was a Congress leader and the deputy prime minister. Both Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru and Sardar admired each other,” he said.
“When Modiji sets up the Statue of Unity, I would request him to put a copper plate with a letter from Sardar Patel, dated February 4, 1939, which he wrote to RSS chief M S Golwalkar on Mahatma Gandhi’s murder,” he said."

Stakeholders at the three-day annual convention of Association of Domestic Tour Operators of India (ADTOI), to conclude Sunday at the Statue of Unity (SOU) in Kevadia with 400 participants, were not able to experience the flight. Officials organising the conference said delegates, who were looking forward to taking a seaplane ride during their visit had begun enquiries about the service much before their arrival. The service, however, has been suspended since February 2 when the seaplane flew to Male where it is registered with Maldivian Aero as 8QISC, for regular maintenance. It was expected to return to Ahmedabad on February 10.
This is the second time that the aircraft has flown to the Maldives for over 10 days to undergo required checks after December when it spent the entire month in Maldives.
An official of SoU who did not want to be quoted said, “There is a whole delegation of tourism stakeholders in Kevadia and despite assurance that the seaplane will arrive on February 10, it has not come back. It has raised many questions about the suspension. This would have been an ideal time to promote the seaplane as a part of the tourist attractions in Kevadia.” SpiceJet, which is operating the service on a wet-lease from Maldivian Aero, told The Sunday Express in an email “The complete aircraft requires a maintenance check once a month.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Though pilots and technicians accompany the Maldivian seaplane for its operations in Gujarat, “SpiceJet Technic” bears the cost of the maintenance, and the Maldivian Civil Aviation Authority inspects it, SpiceJet said. The airlines is now planning to recruit a team of maintenance experts who could work at the proposed seaplane hangar on the Sabarmati Riverfront. An official from the technical team of SpiceJet told The Sunday Express that the aviation company was looking at purchasing its own fleet of Twin Otter-300 series from the Canadian manufacturing company De Havilland.
The official said, “SpiceJet is committed to the service and it is something unique that India has not experienced before. There are some bottlenecks as of now due to the ongoing pandemic and we have had to make do with the wet-lease from the Maldives firm because the manufacturer De Havilland has temporarily suspended its manufacturing unit due to Covid-19. We are looking at expanding the seaplane services in the Andaman Islands apart from adding more flights to the Ahmedabad-Kevadia route. So, the plan is to purchase our own fleet of the aircraft, which will then be maintained and examined in India as we will also simultaneously have the infrastructure ready.” According to the official, the current seaplane — which rolled out in 1971 and is 50 years old — requires mandatory maintenance every 124 flying hours. “The rule book is that it has to undergo a thorough maintenance every 122-124 flying hours” ,the official said.
Officials of SpiceJet added the company was looking at seeking the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme under UDAN project of the Civil Aviation, which would allow the company to make up for the losses that it currently faces running under the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS).
Captain Ajay Chauhan, Director, Civil Aviation, and CEO of Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure Company Ltd (GujSAIL) said, “This being a small aircraft operation, the per seat cost becomes high as it more like a private jet. At this hour of coming out of the pandemic, it is required to make the scheme self-sustainable, which would take a year or two. All efforts are on course to bring down fixed and variable costs to bare minimum, by looking at new choices of lease, equipment, schemes, VGF, stability, maintenance, etc.”
Under VGF, the state government pays the fare for nine seats on a one-way flight, that means 18 seats on a return journey, which makes it about 144 seats paid by the government per day. Under RCS, the government can pay only for nine seats on one flight per sector per day, Chauhan said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday inaugurated the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam in Narmada District of Gujarat on Sunday. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Union minister Nitin Gadkari accompanied him to the event. The dam’s height was raised to 138 meters, making it the second tallest in the country. The foundation stone for the project was laid by the country’s first PM, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on April 5, 1961.
The PM after inaugurating the dam, headed to Dabhoi where he addressed a gathering. During his speech, he spoke about the dam project, the Statue of Unity and condoled the death of Late Air Marshal Arjan Singh, who died on Saturday evening at the age of 98.
Here are the top quotes by PM Modi:
* Today, after the inauguration of Narmada Dam, the soul of Sardar Patel must be jubilant, blessing us all. Sardar Patel had envisioned the dam years before, you, I and we all were born, before our independence. He would be happy today…imagine his vision that he envisioned this Dam to help farmers and citizens.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
* If two people were alive, this dam would have been built long ago. One, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Two, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who as Minister gave great emphasis to irrigation and waterways. It was India’s misfortune that we lost Sardar Patel and Ambedkar so early, today’s day is dedicated at their feet.

* In the obstructions created by forces against Narmada project, Maa Narmada has suffered the most. When then govt refused funds, we decided World bank or no world bank, we will build Sardar Sarovar with our hands.
* Nothing is bigger impediment to development than water; As Gujarat CM, I visited a BSF post and saw that they had no drinking water. I had resolved that I will bring Narmada waters to my country’s Jawan at Pakistan border in Gujarat, 700 km away.
* We overcame all conspiracies against Maa Narmada to complete the Sardar Sarovar project. When world bank refused money for Sardar Sarovar Dam, temples of Gujarat had donated money for the project.
* When a son gives water to its parched mother earth, what can be a bigger feeling of satisfaction. When animals will bless for the green pastures created by Sardar Sarovar, I will be a grateful son of Bharat Mata.
* You know me; I can’t do small things. I don’t think small, don’t do small. With 1.25 billion people with me, can’t dream small.
* I want to thank CMs of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, and my adivasi brothers who gave up their lands.
* I dreamed big about Sardar Patel statue of 182 mtrs; taller than Statue of Liberty. Narmada will become centre of tourism. I conducted a detailed survey of Statue of Unity; I want to give my countrymen these priceless gifts in the future.
* My adivasi brothers have fought for independence of Maa Bharati, despite British executing hundreds of adivasi fighters. People think only handful people fought for independence; Tribal Museums will pay tribute to valiant adivasi fighters. Tribal museums will be digitally equipped and will connect the youth with the real heroes of the freedom struggle.
* Today is Vishwakarma Jayanti; Can be no bigger tribute to workers who constructed the Narmada dam than to dedicate the dam to those workers.
* I have memories of Dabhoi; of riding two wheelers, but never have I seen such a sea of people in Dabhoi. I am living for your dreams, I will also exhaust myself to for your dreams; for New India. I will leave no stone unturned to achieve New India like Mahatma Gandhi achieved a new India earlier."

The elections to the civic corporations were due in December last year, but were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Around 1.14 crore voters are expected to cast their votes at 144 wards with a total 575 seats across the six cities. This time, the cities are going to polls after having expanded their geographical limits and thus with an increased voter base. The BJP was in power in all these municipal corporations.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Monday and has been undergoing treatment at UN Mehta Hospital in Ahmedabad, will cast his vote in Rajkot, while BJP’s state president C R Paatil, who is an MP from Navsari seat, will be voting in Surat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Gujarat |2015 allies gone, Congress faces an aggressive BJP alone in 2021
For the first time the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), founded by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and Asaduddin Owaisi-led All Indian Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) are contesting in the local body elections in the state.
Gujarat polls
This year, the BJP’s campaign had largely focussed on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the abrogation of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir, and the Statue of Unity. The Congress, on the other hand, has promised a ‘GujRight’ card in its manifesto that would give access to citizens to all public amenities. In Vadodara, the party had kicked up a storm when it announced ‘date destinations’ and coffee shops for youth, women, and students to meet up, with the BJP calling it an “Italian mindset”, in a veiled dig at the party’s president.
Last year, as the state was ‘unlocking’ during the pandemic, the Congress had appointed the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) founder Hardik Patel as its working president. The BJP, meanwhile, appointed Paatil, who has roots in Maharashtra, as its state chief.
In 2015, the elections to not only the municipal corporations but also the municipalities and the panchayats were influenced by the quota agitation led by Hardik that saw a major swing in the votes towards the Congress — the impact of which was most felt in the Surat Municipal Corporation, where the Congress’s seat share went up to 36 from the 14 it had won in 2010. Twenty-six of these 36 seats were in the Patidar-dominated areas.
The AAP, which appointed former PAAS member Gopal Italia as its state president, has 469 candidates in the fray from 144 wards in six cities and one from Junagadh seat. The AIMIM has 21 candidates, of whom four are former corporators and two are non-Muslims.
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is an ally of the Congress in Maharashtra, has fielded 28 candidates in Rajkot, and 10 in Jamnagar. NCP has also fielded two on the as many seats going to bypolls in Junagadh.
This year, the BJP has won uncontested on one seat in Naranpura ward of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation after the lone opponent, the Congress, withdrew its candidate.
Till 2010, each ward had three seats, with one reserved for a woman corporator as per the 33 per cent quota, which was raised to 50 per cent in 2015 and the number of seats per ward were raised to four.
With the elections being held in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Election Commission (SEC) has introduced some special arrangements. The timing of voting has been scheduled between 7 am and 6 pm, while a special standard operating procedure (SOP) has also been announced for Covid-19 positive patients to cast their votes. Such patients, who are willing to cast their votes, can do so only between 5 pm and 6 pm while adhering to the SOP which include intimating the nodal officer and returning officer concerned of their Covid-19 positive status 24 hours in advance and obtaining a fitness certificate from an MBBS or above doctor. A Covid-19 patient also has to wear a PPE kit at his/her own cost while going to vote.

The rules of the SEC for voting also include thermal screenings of every voter at each booth. Wearing of mask is also compulsory, but the staff on election duty can ask a person to remove the same to ascertain true identity before voting.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

“Once the construction work for the new Parliament is over, it shall again be relocated to a prominent position,” said a spokesperson of the ministry of housing and urban affairs.
“The statue was moved on Tuesday and is currently at Gate 3 of the Parliament,” said an official from the Rajya Sabha secretariat.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The statue was sculpted by Sutar (95), who has also designed the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, of Sardar Patel, in Gujarat.
The Central Public Works Department had organised a competition for a statue of Gandhi in a sitting pose around 1984, said Anil Sutar, Ram Sutar’s son.
The Parliament house estate currently hosts 16 statues and busts including that of Gandhi.
Of these, many are made by Ram Sutar. Anil Sutar told The Indian Express, “Once people saw the Gandhi statue, we kept getting orders to make more. My father made statues of many historic figures at the Parliament such as Sardar Patel, Bhagat Singh, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Ranjit Singh, Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others.”
The sculptor had made a 2.5-feet model of the statue initially, which was put on display by CPWD.
Sutar had earlier told The Indian Express that Prime Ministers Morarji Desai and Indira Gandhi were impressed by it.Delhi NewsCurbs on dine-in till April 30 will cripple industry, say restaurantsSurge in Covid patients, colleagues testing positive: Across Delhi hospitals, doctors and nurses face burnoutDelhi High Court allows 50 people to perform namaz at Markaz mosqueClick here for more
The statue was supposed to come up at the India Gate, where the bust of King George V used to rest, and from where it was removed in the 1960s, but this idea was later scrapped, he said."

Modi told his winning team not to ridicule or belittle the vanquished Opposition in the aftermath of polls irrespective of whatever they do to me 
…I will deal with them in my own way, he told his supporters at the party headquarters here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi said the results proved that people had voted for security,peace and development instead of voting for false propaganda. 
I may not have a place in the media space but certainly ensconced in the hearts of the people… I will win over the media also in the coming days with love and affection because we want to serve this nation, he said.
Telling workers to always keep the party above self-interest,he said the BJP was like mother to him and no son can be bigger than his mother. 
Modi said the party owed the victory to its workers who played their respective roles,including himself,as assigned to them. Pledging to serve people with more vigour,he said the win also meant greater responsibility of meeting the rising expectations of voters and fulfilling their aspirations. 
Speaking in Hindi,he said he chose the language to emphasise the significance of the victory that had nationwide importance.
Without naming the Congress,he said people were teaching them lesson after lesson but they were just refusing to learn.
On the controversial announcement about the statue of unity,he said the people had a sixth sense with which they would catch the real intent behind what was being said. 
In this context,he said the Opposition advertisement about a 10-headed demon had boomeranged on them. We dont release advertisements but simply address public meetings, he said.
Modi said Muslims had voted for the BJP because they were convinced that not appeasement but development would bring about a turn in their lives."

File
To which department Jan Dhan Scheme is related, when is Sushasan Day (National Governance Day) celebrated, on which river bank the Statue of Unity is built – these were some of the questions asked to students in a General Knowledge Test conducted by the Surat Municipal School Board (SMSB) on Monday.
The test was held for Class VIII students and over 20,000 students of municipal schools in Surat appeared in the Test conducted in different schools in morning and afternoon shifts.
SMSB sources said the 50-mark exam had 20 multiple choice questions for 2 marks each and a descriptive question that asked students to name the five best works done by the central government carried 10 marks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A copy of the question paper accessed by The Indian Express shows that students were asked questions about various schemes launched by the BJP-led government at the Centre. Some of the questions were — To which department Jan Dhan Scheme is related, When is Shushashan Day (National Governance Day) celebrated, Udaan Scheme is related to which department, whose birthday is celebrated as Shushashan Day, what are the facilities provided by the government under Ujwala scheme, the Kumbh Mela is to be organised in which city, on which river bank Statue of Unity is built, on which date the International Yoga Day celebrated, the full form of GST, among others.
The question papers were in Gujarati and Hindi languages.
The SMSB had a few days ago issued a circular to the principals of all 313 municipal schools in the city, asking them to conduct the General Knowledge test for Class VIII students. The exams were conducted between 9 am and 10 am, and 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm. They were given 40 minutes to complete the test.
Congress member in Surat Municipal Education Board Shafi Jariwala said, “Now the BJP is playing with the brains of students by putting questions related to different schemes started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We will not tolerate this and will protest. If a question paper is on General Knowledge, then there are many questions that can be asked.”
Surat Municipal Administrative Officer Vimal Desai could not be contacted despite several attempts.
But, reacting to the incident, chairman of Surat Municipal Education Board Hasmukh Patel said, “The purpose of the GK Test is that we want to check how much our students know about the central government schemes. The second reason is that in the municipal schools majority of the students come from poor backgrounds. We wanted to make them aware of the government schemes so they can avail benefits.”
“The OMR answer sheets will be checked by schools supervisors who have been supplied with answer keys. We will start a drive in schools where maximum numbers of students fail the test, and make them aware of the central government schemes. The reason for conducting the test for Class VIII is that from next year they will switch over to other schools so they should know about different government schemes.”
He added, “We will conduct such exams for students of other standards soon and questions will be asked depending on their capabilities, even if the Congress opposes or protests.”"

Among the new initiatives announced are a housing scheme for industrial labourers and a scheme to strengthen pre-primary education in Gujarat. “In order to ensure that labourers get their dwellings near the factories where they work, our government is going to launch Mukhyamantri Audyogik Shramyogi Ane Industrial Housing Aawas (MASIHA) scheme.

A sum of Rs 2,150 crore to build 1,00,000 houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) and 55,000 under PMAY (Urban) was earmarked. Budget proposals also included an allocation of Rs 15 crore for growing two lakh saplings of “Kamalam” or Dragon fruit, recently renamed by the state government. The money allocated is for nurseries and plantations to grow and maintain “Kamalam” fruit within a radius of 50 km of Kevadia where the Statue of Unity is located.
The budget launched new phases of 13-year-old schemes for tribals and fishermen launched by then Chief Minister Modi. The government also said it will provide free-of-cost cycles to 1.82 lakh girl students from Scheduled Castes and developing castes."

In less than a week of the onset of monsoon in Gujarat, the state recorded 13 per cent average rainfall till Sunday, five per cent higher than the same time of the year in 2018. This comes as a relief for the state that is among one of the most water-stressed states in the country.
Barring Central and Kutch areas where the season’s rainfall was recorded at 9 and 6 per cent respectively, the remaining parts of the state received between 12 and 15 per cent rainfall.
The progress of the monsoon that arrived in Gujarat on June 25 has been good compared to last year. The highest rainfall recorded in Saurashtra are in the districts of Gir Somnath at 28.89 per cent followed by Bhavnagar 19.97 per cent, Junagadh 19.09 per cent and Amreli 18.40 per cent. In the Southern belt, districts of Bharuch, Navsari and Surat recorded rainfall above 15 per cent reaching 20.80, 17.14 and 15.25 per cent respectively.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In Ahmedabad district, where the monsoon reached in the last week of June, 10.53 per cent average rainfall was recorded so far, going by the records of past 5-6 years. “There are favourable conditions for the north-western parts of the country but it is yet to be seen particularly for Gujarat,” said Manorama Mohanty, IMD regional additional director.

As per IMD standards, if Kutch, the last part of Gujarat, gets rainfall, then the entire state is covered. However, no rain is expected in Kutch in the coming five days. “There is a system being developed over the Bay of Bengal but it is not likely to bring rainfall to Gujarat. If that was effective, Kutch would have been covered,” Mohanty added.
This year, so far the state received 108.59 mm rainfall that covered all talukas. Out of 251 talukas, 56 talukas are within 0-50 mm rainfall bracket, the highest is in 51-125 mm rainfall in 119 talukas. Districts of Gir Somnath, Gandhinagar (with 14.96 per cent rainfall) and Sabarkantha (16.80 per cent) are already in the excess category, according to the IMD.
Till end of June in 2018, 67.65 mm rainfall was recorded and 28 talukas were under the 0-50 mm category. Monsoon arrived in the state on June 23 last year.
South Gujarat is expected to continue receiving heavy rainfall. As per the latest IMD forecast, heavy to very heavy rain is very likely at isolated places in the districts of South Gujarat region, including Valsad, Navsari, Dang, Daman and Dadara Nagar Haveli on Monday and Tuesday."

A human lifespan is too short compared with the life of a nation. However, the legacy of visionaries — Abraham Lincoln who led America into a new era or Nelson Mandela in South Africa or the stalwart of Indian nationhood, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — will guide nations for ages.
In public life, there is inevitably an urge to take credit — it comes naturally to politicians all over the world. It is an unfortunate tendency. Regimes that hold power are known to scuttle endeavours to raise memorials and commemorate visionaries. They do so in order to claim all credit for the long-drawn process of nation building. That is why, in India, the legacy of many a great visionary has been ignored. Sardar Patel is one such leader, whose contribution has been sidelined by the powers-that-be for decades.
However, now the world’s tallest of statue will celebrate the contributions of the Sardar. Inaugurated on Wednesday at Sadhu Bet, Sardar Sarovar Dam in district Narmada, 90 km from Vadodara, the Statue of Unity, the giant memorial statue was commissioned by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. It is fitting that Narendra Modi inaugurated the statue as prime minister.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It is pertinent to highlight the message the government wants to send out by inaugurating this statue. Would the Union of India be a reality without the contribution of Patel? In fact, without his contribution, India would be a fragmented cluster of tiny princely states, autonomous unto themselves, something that the British would have wanted to happen. These scattered states or city states would be riven with animosity and torn apart by conflicts. Imagine, how many enemies would we be fighting? Would we be seeking visas for visiting Gujarat or Telangana or the states in the Northeast just as we seek visas for visiting places of pilgrimage in Pakistan, China and Bangladesh ?
The monumental contribution of Patel can never be evaluated without going through the critical phase of Indian political history between 1947-50. Also, no assessment of the role played by the Sardar is possible without undertaking a tour of the places he visited and impacted.
Many thinkers and philosophers have termed India as a cultural entity. India is indeed one of the world’s oldest civilisations, whose nationality is based upon its culture and does not derive from isolated federal units or states. Would India have found its calling as a nation with 565 fragmented and dissociated units? This nation would have failed to find its identity as a nation state had Patel not been there. To establish themselves as a strong nation, cultural entities require a robust governing structure.
The Statue of Unity is both a story about the making of present day India and a homage to the architect of that nationhood, who united the country during and after Independence. It will open up vital pages of history to newer generations. As the highest statue in the world, it will make history of sorts.
Patel’s great work for the integration and unification of India will be celebrated by this statue. Made from the iron used and contributed by farmers from each village in India, and from earth brought from every Indian village, the grand monument will stand tallest in the world even as it would be imprinted in the consciousness of every Indian.
But if we delve into the personality of Patel, we will realise that his life was far more expansive than this memorial to him. This national pilgrimage centre would introduce, to the present generation, the valour of this nation even as it will unravel the untold aspects of its history and inform people about the sacrifices of its real heroes. This is somewhat on the lines of the Yad Vashem museum of Israel that is devoted to the victims of holocaust.
The memory of Sardar Patel will no longer be dwarfed."

(Source: EXPRESS)
After nearly 50 years, the primary school at Karamsad in Anand district, where Sardar Patel studied from Class I to Class VI, has been restored with parts of the building converted into an anganwadi, skill development centre for wo-men and a memorial showcasing rare photographs of Patel several of which were sourced from Sardar’s family. A good part of the money for the renovation came from the MPLAD fund of union minister for Human Resource Development, Smriti Irani, who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Anand.
The trust-run school had closed down in 1965 after a new primary school was constructed in the vicinity. The school since then lay neglected, and had turned into a dumpyard with overgrown weeds covering the building. The school was under the care of Sardar Patel Trust—managed by Patel’s family members—but it could not renovate the building for want of fund and had been approaching the state government for help.
The trust was given responsibility of the school by the Keshubhai Patel government in 1998 and was even granted some funds that apparently fell short of the required amount. Subsequent governments turned down demands for fund. It was only a year ago, after the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi took forward his pet project, the Rs 2,600-crore Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in Narmada district, in earnest, that the school was again brought to the notice of the state government. The government asked the trust to hand it over to the Karamsad municipality for further development. “Until a year ago, virtually nobody was interested in renovating the building. There was a shortage of funds and the government was also not interested. When the trust handed over the school to the municipality a year ago, we took up the matter on a priority basis, with the aim of reviving it by October 31, Patel’s birth anniversary,” said president of Karamsad nagarpalika, Nilesh Patel.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The renovation began around six months back and Rs 95 lakh was spent on it, with the state government offering Rs 25 lakh while a large chunk of Rs 40 lakh coming from the local area development (MPLAD) grant of HRD minister Smriti Irani. The rest was contributed by the industrial units situated at the nearby GIDC. The new building with tiled roof replicates the design of the school that Patel attended between 1882 and 1888. Its model is based on an old photograph that the Karamsad nagarpalika sourced from Patel’s family. Apart from chambers converted into the photo museum, the building also has two rooms that have been earmarked for a library."

“There was a time when Indian rupee was making lots of noise. But today it has lost its voice. And similarly we are unable to hear the voice of our Prime Minister. Both have turned mute,” he said in Saurashtra region.
 Citing Pak and China,Modi attacks ‘soft’ UPA
The Chief Minister was speaking at a function organised to felicitate him for creation of Morbi as a separate district carved out of Rajkot. Modi,on August 15,had announced the formation of seven new districts.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP Election Campaign Committee chief,in his Independence Day speech,had attacked Singh on various issues,including the falling rupee and the stand-offs with Pakistan and China.
Expressing serious concern over the continuous fall in the value of rupee,Modi said,”today our currency is on deathbed. It is in terminal stage and urgently needs attention of a doctor.”
Training guns at the Congress-led ruling coalition at the Centre,he said “at the time of coming to power this Government had promised to reduce inflation within 100 days,but that has eluded the country.”
“At present both – rupee and UPA Government,have lost their value. Time has come to stop our country from destruction. The Central Government is misguiding the country. People need to know why our country is heading towards destruction.”
At the function,Modi was weighed in silver and around 80kg of the white metal was presented to him by representatives of ceramic industry of Morbi.
Modi announced that proceeds from the donated silver will be used for building the proposed ‘Statue of Unity’ monument of Sardar Patel on Narmada river.
In his almost hour-long address,Modi singled out the Congress,which is out of power in the state since mid-1990s,for criticism. “The party should ponder why people are not allowing it to enter Gujarat.”
 “At the time of independence,people aspired for self- rule and good governance. More than 60 years have passed but people are still asking why we don’t have good governance in the country?” Modi said.
The BJP leader said Gujarat has recorded rapid growth in the last one decade,but some people are spreading lies about development indicators in the state.
“Gujarat is growing and developing,it is not a burden on anyone. But there is one section which is spreading lies about Gujarat because they can not digest the development here,” the Chief Minister maintained."

Having led farmer agitations in the past several years as president of the BJP’s All India Kisan Morcha, Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar has stirred a hornet’s nest after he termed the farmers who commit suicide as cowards and criminals.
Dhankar is, however, not new to controversy. His controversial remarks pertaining to the problem of low sex ratio in Haryana had earlier created a stir. In 2014, Dhankar had stated that the BJP would get brides from Bihar to ensure that the men in Haryana can get married. The statement was condemned by several sections of society including women activists and politicians from Bihar. While it was later stated that his statement had been twisted, the damage had been done.
[related-post]



The first in his family to join politics, Dhankar was born in Dhakla village in Jhajjar district in 1961. Dhankar was a regular at RSS shakhas since 1978. From 1981 to 1996 he was a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) where he held several positions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
During his tenure the organisation handed him the task of conducting a study on the problems in the education system in the country and how it could be improved. He later joined the BJP and was a lecturer of Geography who taught Class XII students.
In his career spanning three decades, he has held several positions in BJP including state general secretary and state president. This is the first time that he has won an election. Earlier, he contested the Assembly elections in 2009 and lost. He also suffered defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections at the hands of Deepinder Hooda, son of former Chief Minister B S Hooda. He won the Assembly elections held later that year from Badli constituency.
In fact, when questioned on why Swaminathan Commission report, of which he was such a proponent as a farmer, was not being implemented, Dhankar is known to say that people elected him as an MLA and not the MP. He can now only take the issues of the people to the Centre and lobby for their implementation but can’t do anything on his own as an MLA.
At present, apart from the Agriculture Ministry, Dhankar is holding charge of four other ministries. These include Animal Husbandry and Dairy, Fisheries, Development and Panchayats as well as Irrigation. He is considered the fourth most influential minister in the Cabinet.
Dhankar was entrusted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi the task of collecting soil and iron tools from across the country for his flagship project – the Statue of Unity. Dhankar was appointed the national coordinator of the Iron Collection Corporation Committee. He worked closely with Modi when the latter was incharge of the Haryana unit of BJP. Dhankar was at that time the general secretary of the unit.
Dhankar was elected the national president of BJP Kisan Morcha for two tenures from 2011-13 and 2013-15. He has been working actively on farmer issues for the past one decade. He is also credited with playing a major role in bringing out a Land Acquisition handbook that addressed all kinds of farmer as well as industry issues. He is also a proponent of crop diversification and promoting marketing of crops."

The Shiv Sena Monday asked Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to declare that the statue of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj planned off the Mumbai coast will be the tallest in the world.
The party also asked Fadnavis not to be “scared” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah to declare this, adding having Shivaji’s statue taller than that of Sardar Patel won’t diminish the Iron Man’s prestige. The Sena said NCP’s state unit chief Jayant Patil has claimed the height of Shivaji’s statue has been decreased to ensure that Patel’s Statue of Unity remains the tallest.
It said Fadnavis should use the same courage that he displayed in announcing quota for the Maratha community, and not be “scared” of Prime Minister Modi and Shah over the issue of Shivaji statue’s height. Decreasing the height of Shivaji’s statue to make Sardar Patel’s statue look taller is a “narrow and distorted mindset”, the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Fadnavis should use the same courage he showed while granting reservation to the Maratha community and fearlessly

announce that Shivaji’s statue would be the tallest in the world, and not get scared of Amit Shah and Modi. This will not diminish the prestige of Sardar Patel,” it said.
The Uddhav Thackeray-led party reminded Fadnavis that earlier, then Union finance minister Chintamanrao Deshmukh in

the Jawaharlal Nehru government had shown courage to tender his resignation, to ensure Mumbai stayed with Maharashtra. The party rued that while the ‘Statue of Unity’ has already been unveiled and opened for public viewing, not a single brick has been laid for the construction of Shivaji’s statue.
There are now doubts being raised if there was an internal conspiracy to make Shivaji’s statue seem like a dwarf compared to the structure dedicated to Sardar Patel, it said. Shivaji’s statue should be larger than that of any other leader and all parties should come together for it, said the Sena, BJP’s ally at the Centre and in Maharashtra.
Prime Minister Modi had on October 31 inaugurated the imposing 182-metre statue of Sardar Patel, the first home minister of independent India, in Gujarat’s Narmada district. The Congress and the NCP had said in the Maharashtra Assembly in July that the height of Shivaji’s statue, to be built in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast, was being reduced, a claim then rejected by Fadnavis, who had said it will be the tallest in the world.
In response to an RTI query, the BJP-led state government had said that certain “height specifications” of the Shivaji memorial were changed to reduce the project cost. BJP-backed MLC Vinayak Mete, who is chairman of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial Committee, Monday said the total height of the statue, including the pedestal, would be 212 metres. The height of the statue and pedestal would be in the 60:40 ratio, he added."

The Gujarat health department on Saturday allayed fears about the spread of coronavirus other parts of the country and said “we are absolutely safe” as not a single positive case of COVID-2019 has been reported in the state so far.
Addressing media persons, Principal Secretary, health department, Jayanti Ravi said the administration was in touch with every single person returning from foreign countries, especially the seven affected countries.
Stressing that the administration does not plan to shut down schools or public places such as malls as they do not want to create “unnecessary havoc”, Ravi said, “Evidence shows there have not been any cases through local transmission… If positive cases come out in a specific cluster or village, it is important that appropriate measures are taken immediately but there is no need to create unnecessary havoc.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On the framing and notifying of Gujarat Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020, on Friday, Ravi said that the move followed the first first reported death in the country in Karnataka earlier this week and said there is “no COVID-19 epidemic in Gujarat”.
“It is to ensure that we do not see any case of ‘leave against medical advice or discharge against medical advice’ similar to that seen in the first case (where a coronavirus infected person died) in Gulbarga, Karnataka,” she said. The regulations empower authorised persons to forcefully admit, retain, keep and isolate a suspected patient for a period of 14 days even if the patient resists.
Till Saturday evening, samples from 77 patients across the state were taken, of which 72 tested negative while the results for five are pending.
“We have 38 quarantine facilities with a provision of 1,170 beds. Passengers arriving from the seven affected countries of China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany and Spain are being forcibly quarantined for 14 days. The quarantine needn’t necessarily be at a medical facility but involves keeping them under observation with regular check-ups. Facilities to keep 500 suspected cases are available in Ahmedabad and Surat. Fortunately, we have not had any cases…,” added Ravi.
Appealing against public gathering and reiterating the state government’s decision to cancel all government-organised workshops, conferences and seminars until March 31, Ravi said the Gujarat High Court’s directions to the state on the installation of “temperature guns” on the HC premises will be complied with.
Fever helpline
Of the approximate 500 calls received per day on the designated “fever helpline” in the state — 104 — more than 330 calls were related to COVID-19 and another 100 calls were received at the state control room, said Ravi.
Use of masks
Pointing out that masks are essential for those who are sick and for health workers, Ravi said, “We have a stock of nearly 48,000 N-95 masks for our health workers. Nearly 27,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits are available for those working in infectious wards.”
Statue of Unity
Thermal scanners have been installed and a medical team has been stationed at the Statue of Unity, according to Nilesh Dubey, deputy collector at Kevadia and administrator at SoU. “Around 45 people were referred to medical teams after thermal scanners detected high temperatures but they did not have any coronavirus symptoms. The footfall is anyway less due to ongoing board exams. However, there is no plan to keep the SoU closed to tourists as of now,” said Dubey.
Private firms
A Chinese national employed with a Vadodara-based Chinese private company was referred to the SSG Hospital by the management on Saturday after she showed symptoms of suspected COVID-19. The woman has been in India since January this year but raised an alert after she reported symptoms of COVID-19 on Friday. However, doctors cleared her after preliminary examination.
A company spokesperson told this newspaper, “Although she has been in India since January, her husband, who had been travelling to various places visited her recently. Later she showed symptoms that matched COVID-19. We did not want to take a chance and brought her to SSG for tests. Doctors suggested isolation and made a thorough check on her. She was cleared after being diagnosed with gastritis-related fever and illhealth.”
 
Somnath Temple
The authorities of Somnath Temple, one of the most popular pilgrimage destinations in the state, installed three thermal scanners on the premises on Saturday afternoon even as the footfall of devotees dropped drastically.
Vijay Singh Chawda, general manager of Shree Somnath Trust (SST) told this paper, “If any devotee is found with a high (more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit) temperature, then temple officials are obliged to report the case to the government. The footfall of devotees has come down to 12,000 against our regular weekend footfall of 35,000 to 40,000. More than 100 online bookings for our guest house have been cancelled.”
Central varsity
The Central University of Gujarat on Saturday announced that it has decided to suspend “all classes and examinations” scheduled to be held from March 16 till March 21. The circular dated March 14 and issued by registrar Alok Gupta states that the latest announcement is “in compliance with a communication by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi”. The circular cautions to avoid any mass gatherings during the week-long period, but faculty and staff of CUG have been asked to attend office as usual. The circular states that “further directions will be issued by the university in due course after March 21”.
SMC in action
The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has closed down its all municipal facilities, including swimming pools, auditoriums, community halls and party plots from March 14 to 31. It has also temporarily suspended the biometric attendance system for its employees.
Surat Municipal Commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani on Saturday issued a circular to all the zonal heads, dean of SMIMER College and municipal hospitals in the city. The circular mentioned that till March 31, all swimming polls, auditoriums, party plots and community halls will remain closed. If anybody had booked these facilities between March 15 to March 31, the SMC will request them to postpone the events and would refund the booking amount to them, it said.
The SMC health department will soon start helpline number for help related to coronavirus infection. Medical staff had been advised to make sufficient arrangements. The corporation also has increased penalty for spitting in public places to Rs 250 from Rs 100.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Talking to the Indian Express, Pani said, “We have taken such step voluntarily. We have cancelled all our programmes and seminars. We are discouraging the people from going to crowded places and for that an awareness campaign also had been started. We have readied a 50-bed quarantine ward in Vesu and another same ward in Umra Community health centre.”"

On the occasion, which coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, Minister of State for Narmada Yogesh Patel along with Managing Director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) Rajiv Gupta performed Narmada puja at the zero point of the dam to mark the FRL. CM Vijay Rupani also joined over video conference.
Modi retweeted a video put out by SSNNL of overflowing dam and said, “On this day, last year had the honour of being at the site of the dam and had paid tributes at the iconic Statue of Unity.” Rupani also tweeted about it.
At around 6 am on Thursday, SSNNL opened 23 of the 30 gates of the dam to begin releasing close to 1.1 lakh cusecs of water into the river as the reservoir reached its capacity of 138.68 metres. Rupani, who joined the celebrations from Gandhinagar via video conference, addressed the state and spoke of the importance of Narmada dam for the development of Gujarat. The live storage in the dam is 5,760 Million Cubic Metres on Thursday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Recalling the “struggle and hard work” of Modi, who was the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Rupani accused the Congress of delaying the completion of the dam for several years. Rupani recalled the year 2014, when Modi, after taking oath as Prime Minister in May, cleared the way for the completion of the installation of gates of the dam after raising its height to 163 metres.
Rupani said, “In the coming time, the dam will play a key role in taking water to Saurashtra, Banaskantha and Kutch. The filling of the reservoir for two consecutive years is an indication that it will help us in our development goals as water is the most essential commodity for development.”
Events to mark birthday
Gujarat government and Gujarat BJP organised various programmes to celebrate Modi’s birthday. The state government launched a number of welfare and people-centric schemes.
One of the schemes launched was Mukhyamantri Mahila Utkarsh Yojana (MMUY). It was launched by Rupani virtually from Gandhinagar even as different state leaders and office bearers of various institutes of self governance attended physical functions from 70 locations in the state.
Under the scheme, the state government is planning to provide interest-free loan of Rs 1 lakh to one lakh women self-help groups (SHGs) in the state. Each SHG will have 10 women members. The government has also waived stamp duty on the borrowing by the SHGs.
Anjali, wife of Rupani, attended one such event at Raysan village of Gandhinagar district. It was also attended by Gandhinagar mayor Rita Patel and municipal commissioner Ratankanvar Gadhavicharan.
Anjali said that MMUY can be quite helpful to women in the post Covid-19 era when people’s budgets have gone haywire and many have lost jobs.
The media cell of Ahmedabad BJP celebrated Modi’s birthday by distributing 70 kits containing various grocery items among 70 needy families in the city, said a release from Ahmedabad BJP’s media cell convener Amit Jyotikar.
An exhibition on Modi was also organised at Gujarat BJP state headquarters Shree Kamalam.
In Surat, a portrait — made on the theme of Mother’s Love depicting Modi with his mother — was exhibited at Home Automation Gallery. The 7-feet wide and 5-feet high portrait has been made by Craft Melon Art firm owned by Bhanuprakash R of Bangalore. It is being promoted by a Surat-based firm, Wood N Chisel.
Talking to The Indian Express Bhanuprakash R, said, “Over 25 artisans worked for 16 months and over 10,000 pieces of wood (have been used) for this portrait. (Several) lakhs of rupees have been spent on this portrait… The trees are found in the forest in Mysore. This is one of the biggest portraits of Wood Inlay Art form.”"

Days after the attacks on Hindi-speaking migrants in Gujarat, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said Monday his state was for all Indians and cared for everybody’s “honour, development and safety”. Migrants, especially those hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, were targeted in several parts of Gujarat following the arrest of a Bihar native for allegedly raping a 14-month-old girl earlier this month.
“India is one, and this Gujarat is of (Mahatma) Gandhi, Sardar (Vallabhbhai Patel) and (Prime Minister Narendra) Modji. This is a mini-India (laghu Bharat) for all the Indians, and everyone’s honour, safety and development is ensured,” Rupani said.
People from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states have contributed to the development of Gujarat, he said during the second day of his visit to Lucknow. Rupani had arrived in the Uttar Pradesh capital Sunday evening and has extended an invitation to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the unveiling ceremony of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s ‘Statue of Unity’ on the banks of the Narmada river on October 31.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“The way sugar easily dissolves in milk, people from across the country living in Surat, Ahmedabad, Kutch and Baroda are living in harmony and taking Gujarat forward,” he said at a function at the Indira Gandhi Pratisthaan here. The chief minister said in the development of Gujarat, there is the hardwork of people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra.
People from southern and northern states, everyone has contributed to the development of Gujarat, he said.
Describing the ‘Statue of Unity’ a true tribute to Patel, he said, “We challenge those people who want to break the country, we will keep it (India) safe. This is our pledge.”
“The ‘Statue of Unity’ is a symbol of our unity. Today, anti-India forces are indulging in every possible work to break this unity.
“On the basis of the ‘Statue of Unity’, we want to challenge them that we all are one, and we will strive for the country’s unity. No one will be able to break this country, and the Statue of Unity will unite people of this country. We are working in this direction,” Rupani said. He claimed now nowhere in the world such a tall statue is going to come up in the next 25-50 years."

The Karnataka government plans to seek investments for the construction of a 125-feet statue of Mother Cauvery at the Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir in Mandya district, about 90 km from Bengaluru. Expected to be built at a cost of Rs 1200 crore and across 400 acres, the proposal comes about a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel near Vadodara in Gujarat.
The Cauvery river, which originates in the foothills of the Western Ghats in Karnataka’s Kodagu, is the third largest after the Godavari and Krishna in south India and is the lifeline for Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The river also holds religious significance and is worshipped across several cultures.
The entire project, which is likely to be completed within the next two years, will include the statue, a museum complex, two glass houses measuring around 360 feet that will give a bird’s eye view of the reservoir, a band stand, indoor stadium and replicas of historical monuments.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The final touches to the project were given after Karnataka Water Resources Minister DK Shivakumar and Tourism Minister Sa Ra Mahesh held a meeting with officials on Tuesday. Shivakumar said that a new lake would be created next to the reservoir on which the new structures would be constructed, ANI reported.
“The statue will be installed atop the museum complex and between the glass towers. The statue will be taller than the KSR reservoir. Except allocating and providing land for the project, the government isn’t making any investments,” ANI quoted Shivakumar as saying.
“It is not exactly a statue, it will be like a tower. The land already belongs to the govt and we will be inviting investors to invest in it, no govt money will be used. It will be a tourist destination,” he added.

Interestingly, the proposal to build the statue comes at a time when activists have blamed the government of turning a blind eye to illegal sand mining around the Cauvery river, pointing that the river volume has already reduced by 40 per cent over the past 50 years.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already proposed to build a 151-metre tall statue of Lord Ram in Ayodhya on the edge of the Saryu river. Plans are also afoot to build a statue of Shivaji on land reclaimed from the sea near Mumbai. The Maharashtra government has accorded a contract of more than Rs 3,000 crore to L&T for the 210-metre tall statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji."

Two months after the inauguration of the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat’s Narmada district, a series of national and state-level government events have been lined up to be held on the premises the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony.
In February, the premises will host a conference of state election commissioners to review the preparedness for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
While the dates of the meeting have not been finalised, official sources said that the three-day meet will be held in second week of February, and accordingly, the Collector of Narmada district has been notified.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This comes in the heels of annual DGP conference that was held at the world’s tallest statue complex last week and was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Next month, the Gujarat government will also host the three-day International Kite Festival at the Statue of Unity site that will be inaugurated by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on January 8. Interestingly, the festival in which kite flyers from across the world take part used to be held in Saputara hills till a year ago.
“There is no either, or. Both the places are important in their own ways. Since the Statue of Unity is something truly iconic and new, it is a global landmark that we need to popularise,” S J Haider, Gujarat Principal Secretary (Tourism), said.
Amid this, the state government is also exploring the possibility of starting seaplane services from Sabarmati in Ahmedabad to the statue complex. “There are four places in our mind for the seaplane services — Sabarmati river (Ahmedabad), Shetrunji river (Bhavnagar), Dharoi dam (Mehsana), and areas around the Statue of Unity. At the moment, technical studies to start the services are underway. Once technical feasibilities are given a green light, we will go ahead with the project,” Gujarat Tourism Managing Director Jenu Devan told The Indian Express.
According to officials, the Statue of Unity witnesses a daily footfall average of 8,000 visitors. The highest one day record was on November 10, the weekend after Diwali ,when 28,409 tourists visited the site. Till December 23, 4,04,082 people have visited the site, generating an income of Rs 10.11 crore through ticket sales.
According to Haider, the statue has an “immense tourism potential” that required to be unlocked in a way that it should contribute to the inclusive growth and sustainable development of the region. “We are thinking of promoting wellness tourism and yoga, eateries with tribal delicacies. We can have eco-tourism circuits like Zarwani waterfall. The idea is to offer visitors a variety of things on their platter. The centre of attraction will be the Statue of Unity, but on the sidelines there will be additional activities. Like we are thinking of promoting bicycle lanes as a healthy and refreshing activity. We are also planning a theme park near the complex,” said Haider.
“By organising national and international events, tourism will contribute to the local economy and add to the prosperity of the place,” he added."

Statue of Unity: World’s tallest statue unveiled in India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the world’s tallest statue, ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat’s Narmada district on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The Rs 2,989 crore project took 42 months, and round-the-clock work by 3,400 labourers and 250 engineers to complete. The foundation stone of the statue was laid in October 2013 by Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at that time. The Statue of Unity beats China’s ‘Spring Temple Buddha’ as the world’s tallest statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Kartarpur Corridor: VP Venkaiah Naidu lays foundation stone, to be built by next year
To mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev next year, India last week had decided to build the Kartarpur road corridor up to the international border between India and Pakistan to let Sikh pilgrims visit the gurdwara on the banks of the river Ravi in Pakistan. The two neighbouring countries on November 15 had made an official announcement in this regard and had decided to let the pilgrims visit the holy shrine without having to secure a visa.
“I am very happy to be present on a historic day today to lay the foundation for a project we have been dreaming of for a long time. It is a day that promises to bring us closer to the Guru we all revere,” said Venkaiah Naidu.
Cyclone Gaja: Tamil Nadu government seeks about Rs 15,000 crore aid
The Tamil Nadu government sought about Rs 15,000 crore as central assistance towards relief and rehabilitation activities in Cyclone Gaja-hit districts of the state. Chief Minister K Palaniswami, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi here with a plea for central assistance for various sectors in the affected districts, said the death toll from Cyclone Gaja stood at 63.
“I have submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister detailing the extent of the damage caused by the cyclone,” he told reporters in Delhi, adding the state has sought about Rs 15,000 crore.
Mary Kom wins sixth world boxing championship at 35
Mary Kom struck her record 6th gold medal at the World Boxing Championships as she defeated Ukraine’s Hanna Okhota via a 5-0 unanimous decision on Saturday. In doing so, the Manipur boxer became the joint most successful boxer (men and women) in the history of World Championships, tied with the Cuban legend Felix Savon, who had also won six gold medals at the World Championships. It is Kom’s 7th medal overall in the tournament – 6 gold and 1 silver.
“First of all, I would like to thank, all my friends. They came to see the final. They came especially for me, to cheer for me, and all of us in the contingent,” she said. “Thank you for your love and support. I don’t have anything to give you, except for a gold medal for the country. I still hope to win the gold medal for India in Tokyo 2020,” she said.
NASA’s InSight lands on Mars
After over six months of travelling through space and covering a journey of more than 300 million miles, NASA’s Mars science lander InSight touched down safely on the surface of the red planet on Monday. Minutes after landing, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles received a fuzzy “selphie” photograph from the neighbouring planet.
The 880-pound (360 kg) InSight – its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport – marks the 21st US-launched Mars mission. It will now operate from there for the next two years, trying to study the red planet."

Ahmedabad
DAY ONE: September 21, Saturday, 11:00 am
You don’t expect to hear about Gandhi’s planned “surgical strike” of sorts on Pakistan at the start of the journey to rediscover the Mahatma. That, too, just 100 m from his first base camp on his return from South Africa — the much-neglected, 1915-dated Kochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad. Maybe, it was the question.
Asked about Gandhi’s relevance 150 years after his birth, historian Rizwan Kadri, 50, fishes out a thick wad of neatly photocopied spiralbound papers. It has evidence to suggest that Bapu, like most contemporary leaders on both sides of the divide, also spoke of war, or, at least, gave it a thought; maybe even joked about it.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

These are pages from Manuben’s diary — the diligent notes by the girl who was Gandhi’s famous shadow — and, on whose lap he would breathe his last after being shot. Kadri points to an entry from September 26, 1947. That’s more than a month after Independence and the bitter Partition. Those were testy times of mistrust when, as we know now, even the most non-violent seemed to be flirting with fire.
Manuben is conversational in her writings; it’s mostly in colloquial Gujarati. She is narrating one particular evening of “guppa” session over khakhra and doodh that Gandhi had with his guests to a friend. “During the chat, the topic of war came up. Bapu said that (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah was thinking that by conquering Junagadh he could rule Kathiawad and even reach up to Hyderabad. And conquer Delhi from Lahore”.
Then she mentions Gandhi’s rare un-ahimsa utterance, highlighted by Rizwan’s flaming green marker. “I understand Jinnah’s view. If I fight, my view is to conquer Karachi. It is built by Hindus. We have our waterways, we have our steamers, with them we can conquer Karachi and also conquer Lahore via Amritsar.” This is followed by a pithy line: “Pun aa baadhu maaru kyan chaale tem kyan chee (loosely translated as “But when it comes to all these, I don’t have a say).”
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-6030210 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/manuben-diary_759-1.jpg"" alt=""Mahatma Gandhi, gandhi jayanti, mahatma gandhi 150th birth anniversary year, mahatma gandhi Sunday eye"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/manuben-diary_759-1.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/manuben-diary_759-1.jpg?resize=305,450 305w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/manuben-diary_759-1.jpg?resize=407,600 407w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/manuben-diary_759-1.jpg?resize=275,405 275w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> A page from Manuben’s diary.
Gandhi’s realisation of his sudden marginalisation is followed by Manuben’s expression of unwavering awe towards her larger-than-life mentor. “Bapu nu magaj gajab kaam kare chhe (Bapu’s mind works wonderfully. He is even ready with his views on war).”
Many sections of Manuben’s diary are like an accountant’s daily log — cut and dry. Intriguing emotions and episodes are hidden among entries of mundane chores and the drudgery of everyday life. Her matter-of-fact full stops at the end of pregnant sentences add an air of mystery to those times and that “gajab magaj”.
ALSO READ | Bapu’s Life, His Message
Kadri, too, fancies himself as a dispassionate chronicler, an “investigative” historian. “I never say anything without proof,” he keeps repeating. Kadri didn’t need to learn about the freedom struggle from his school’s SST books. His forefathers were Gandhi’s neighbours — they knew Bapu much before he became the Mahatma. Discussions about Gandhi and the freedom struggle took place in his courtyard — there was also this one time when his family members stood in their porch to see off the salt satyagrahis. History had a habit of taking the narrow road outside Kadri’s present home, a Gandhi heritage site.
Of late, the history professor with a college managed by the Swaminarayan sect, had been involved in the Statue of Unity project. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is another of Kadri’s favourite topics. He mentions Jawaharlal Nehru but in the context of Patel unfairly missing the post of Congress president and the prime ministership. Ask him if Gandhi deserved to have the tallest statue and he gives a long answer that’s short on clarity. He wants to talk about Manuben’s diary and Gandhi’s words on war, the narrative that suits the present times.

“Everybody is buying these,” says the young salesboy pointing to the neatly-arranged wooden pen stand that spins on its axis. They are placed at a strategic corner of his table to catch most eyes. Cuboid in shape, it has pictures of leaders on all four sides. Gandhi, Patel, (Subhas Chandra) Bose and, yes, Modi.
“They are all freedom fighters,” shouts the eager seller. He knows you have spotted the “odd one”. “Arre, woh bhi freedom fighter hi hai,” he says. To offer variety, he picks another one. This one has Gandhi, Patel, Modi and, yes, Bhagat Singh.
Inside the Ashram, the weekend hasn’t attracted many faithfuls, or even the tourists from Bengal. It’s late afternoon, the Ashram’s airy, open verandahs with black-and-white pictures on the walls are occupied by students from nearby colleges. They seem to be regulars, they seem at home. Books, cell phones, colourful backpacks, dupattas and helmets are littered around them. It’s like a messy teenagers’ room.
A couple of girls and boys are preparing for competitive exams. “Do you know what was Kasturba’s maiden name?” asks the studious kind. Silence. “Kapadia,” says the quiz master. Lame wisecracks featuring Dimple Kapadia and Twinkle Kapadia follow. The less studious, more-in-love young couples aren’t indoors. They are staring at the silent Sabarmati that flows behind the Ashram.
Among the roadside hawkers, there is talk about the soon-to-be-announced Ashram makeover. They are expecting to be driven out, like it was done around the Statue of Unity. Has the number of tourists here reduced after Sardar’s Guinness Book entry? “No, it has increased, tourists come here after going there,” says a worried looking man selling miniature charkhas. Gandhi piggybacking on Patel? What a comeback Sardar has had around here.

A neatly formed train of pre-school tots and their harried teachers finally bring life to the place. Their yellow T-shirts says Genius Generation. They look knackered, thirsty and slightly cranky. The struggling teachers come up with a masterstroke. Using Gandhi’s three monkeys on the lawns as props, they begin an impromptu photo session. The older sari-clad teacher makes the children, in batches of three, pose like the monkeys behind them. The younger teacher, in jeans, turns photographer for the session, with her phone camera. The frame of kids with hands on their eyes, ears and mouth is probably the most inspiring moment on that muggy lazy Saturday afternoon at Gandhi Ashram.

Kheda
Day one: September 21, Saturday (5 pm)
Just a year after the Sabarmati Ashram came up in 1917, Gandhi was moved by the plight of farmers in Kheda. Like bank Shylocks of modern times, the British government was infamously insensitive to crop failure when it came to collecting taxes.
Gandhi travelled 50 km to Kheda to be with the leaderless peasants. We, too, follow history and reach the village of about 16,000.
Kheda’s famous hard-fought win is forgotten now. Ask anyone about the Satyagraha and you get a blank stare. As a desperate measure, you get into the police station to report the satyagraha that has gone missing. One young cop, Rohit, says he has heard about it but gets the year wrong. Quiz him on what Gandhi means to him, and he blurts out “satya aur ahimsa”. The seasoned pros, the seniors — sitting among weapons, sticks and handcuffs — let out a laugh. Rohit joins in. The scared-as-a-trapped-mouse puny man behind the bars in the corridor is the only one in the vicinity who wouldn’t have found the joke funny.
Rohit has a solution — he gives us the number of a local reporter, who in turn directs me to Kheda’s most informed citizen — 75-year-old Vishu Prasad Vyas.
He is helpful, selfless, assertive and indomitable. If you are in trouble, you would want Vyas on your side; he would get everyone’s vote if he ran for any RWA elections. The one-time accounts officer in Gujarat Electricity Board and a formidable union leader, the man, now hard of hearing, has all the details of the 1918 farmers’ protest. He takes you to the derelict and deserted former court where Gandhi and Patel had appeared. Sadly, he says, years later during the Gujarat’s Navnirman Movement of the mid ’70s, the three-floored imposing structure was burnt down by protesting students. Vyas says he was always for Gandhi’s method of non-violent protest. “It is more effective,” he says.
The fire inside him is still burning but the coldness of the young towards public causes makes him disillusioned at times. “But I don’t care. I still raise my voice against what’s unfair. Unlike in Gandhi’s era, today you can’t mobilise a mass protest regardless of the scale of injustice,” he says.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-6030262 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/vishu-prasad-vyas-gandhi.jpg"" alt=""Mahatma Gandhi, gandhi jayanti, mahatma gandhi 150th birth anniversary year, mahatma gandhi Sunday eye"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/vishu-prasad-vyas-gandhi.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/vishu-prasad-vyas-gandhi.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/vishu-prasad-vyas-gandhi.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/vishu-prasad-vyas-gandhi.jpg?resize=608,405 608w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> Vishu Prasad Vyas in Kheda, where Gandhi had once joined a farmers’ protest.

His latest peeve is the toll booth on a section of the highway that joins Ahmedabad and Dandi. It happens to be on the tourist-friendly section that the state government wants the world to travel to and get a feel of Gandhi’s Salt March. Vyas is outraged.
“Imagine, you pay tax on the same road that Gandhiji walked to avoid taxes back in the day. Imagine, if a foreign tourist passes this toll, what impression he will carry home. Imagine, how hypocritical we have become,” says the man who has written letters and got memorandums signed by Kheda residents and passed them to MPs, MLAs and collectors. “But I won’t stop,” he says, embodying the spirit of the man who once listened to and stood for Kheda’s unheard.
Godhra
Day 2: September 22, Sunday (1 pm)
Godhra is too storied to bypass as one leaves Gandhi’s home state Gujarat. There is more to the city than 2002 and the S6 coach. Beyond the railway platform, the city of “50-50” Hindu-Muslim population of 1.5 lakh is a bundle of contradictions.
Dividing the city into two halves — West for Muslim, East for Hindus — is Road No.2. Many from the west have relatives in Pakistan. Several from the east have migrated from Pakistan, mainly Sindh. It’s a strange mix. Just last month, about 80 people from the west were stranded in Pakistan because of the blockade on the border after the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. It was the intervention of a journalist from the east that brought them back home.
Though the city has a history of communal tensions, the locals feel Godhra 2002 got them undeserving infamy. Sitting at Gandhi chowk, Aslambhai says Godhra didn’t see a single killing in the city after the train got burnt. His friend Karsanbhai nods. They also talk about the many joint businesses owned by residents of the east and west.
Urban legend, make it rural, has it that it was in Godhra that Patel, a Gandhi sceptic once, became a Bapu believer after listening to his lecture. Gandhi’s simple idea of nationalism — inclusiveness and tolerance to divergent views — finds an echo here, especially at the Kesari Chowk deep inside west Godhra.
Farukh Kesri is a busy man. He buys motorcycles confiscated by loan sharks and resells them. The middle-aged man in white, with a skull cap, has another important responsibility. Every day, after dawn and before dusk, he has flag duty.
At Kesri chowk, the crowded square near his shop, there’s a tricolour which never fails to come up each morning and go down in the evening. “After 2002, I was requested by the local police to do this and also to celebrate August 15 and January 26. Now, these have become highly anticipated events. I spend close to Rs 1 lakh,” says Kesri as he fiddles with his computer mouse to look for videos. Soon, there are scenes of a festive Kesri chowk, crowded with locals waving national flags and kids with tricolour painted faces on the screen. There’s also one of him distributing biscuits and water to the Ganesh visarjan procession that passes through the narrow lanes of West Godhra.
What do you feel when people are asked to go to Pakistan for dissent or even for diversity? “I don’t watch news channels,” is his short answer.

Ratlam
Day 3: September 23, Monday (8.30 am)
Platform No 4 of the very busy Ratlam railway station gets the majority of the over 80 trains that stop by at this central Indian city on the Mumbai-Delhi route. All through the day, like a sea during high tide, manic human waves hit this port, triggering a mad frenzy all around. But for the tiny Sarvodaya bookshop which isn’t dictated by the pace of the place or time.
Gopal Krishan Sharma, 62, has been manning this post since 1993. He is proud of his collection of Hindi books, he has a collective noun for them — “uchch koti ka sahitya” (top-notch literature). Pulp fiction can’t enter this book shop. This is the elite club of Gandhi, Vinoba (Bhave), (Ram Manohar) Lohia, Dharamvir Bharati and Shivaji Samant. Making the numbers and keeping the shelves full are assorted cooking and naturopathy books.
For Sharma and his wife, Anu, this is a second home. It’s about 8.30 am, Mr Sharma is in a baniyaan, Mrs Sharma wears a dupatta over her gown. They could well be having their morning tea in their living room.
Speaking to the Sharmas is an eye-opener. You float the cliche of reading being a dying habit and bad mouth children with phones in hand to break the ice. It doesn’t work. Pointing to the much bigger AH Wheeler bookshop that opens both on and outside the Platform No.4, he says with a smile: “They are affected by those things. My books are not available on the internet.”
You mean to say passengers sprawling on upper berths in 3 AC compartments or those squatted near the bathroom of general coaches are reading classics? “No chance, my business runs on serious readers in the city or those who take a train to buy these books. On an average, I make Rs 50,000 a month,” shouts the old man as another train screams on to the platform.
While on the topic of sales, Sharma shares Sarvodaya’s keenly contested Top 5 sellers list. The verdict is out … Vinoba, Gandhi, Lohia, Bhagavad Gita and Samant it is. What about Nehru? “Woh toh last number pe hain,” he says.

He has problems with Nehru. “Gandhiji has never been sufficiently highlighted by Congress. It’s all Nehru for them. Now, it is Modi with this Swachch campaign who is actually bringing Gandhi back in focus. While studying, I had issues with Gandhi’s thoughts but sitting in this shop, reading him changed my view.”
Gandhi’s biggest strength, Sharma says, is his push for truth. “Who has the guts to bring out a book on one’s own weakness? My Experiments with Truth is a very bold book,” he says.
History says Gandhi once used the 20- minute stopover at Ratlam to address his followers. The world might have moved but Sharma, in his cosy corner on Platform 4, is holding on to Gandhi and his principles.
Kota
Day 3: September 23, Monday (6 pm)
Close to 300 km from Ratlam, there is a village that is also continuing a Gandhi legacy — almost every home here has a charkha. Much before the IIT hopefuls descended on Kota, the city had another world-famous cottage industry that operated from a Muslim-dominated village next door. The place is called Kethun.
Kota Doria saris, with their understated designs, vibrant colours and a unique fabric woven with cotton, silk and precious gold-silver zari threads are for those with subtle taste. It’s FabIndia-meets-your neighbourhood-Chanda-Sari-Bhandar.
After speeding down the sparkling new bypass with a Mumbai sealink-wannabe bridge, watching the chain-smoking chimneys of Kota’s chemical plants, you reach the weaver’s colony. Young Imran, an artisan, is talking shop at his jeweller friend’s shop. He is among the 12 in his family who earn Rs 200 a day working on their charkha and looms.
He shares a few numbers that give the scale of the industry. “There are close to 11,000 families who weave Kota Doria saris. They cost from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh. It takes about 15 days to a month-and-a-half to prepare a sari, depending on the design,” says a thoughtful Imran.
His friend invites you home for a live demonstration. The lady on the loom gives a broad smile and moves away when you ask for pictures. Imran takes her place and obliges. The amused lady instructs him. She and her loom go back a long way — they spend most of the day together. “I get just Rs 7,000 for the 45 days of work I put in,” she says.
The reasons power loom-produced Kota Doria hasn’t worked is because of artists like Imran. Machines haven’t yet been able to replicate the rawness and the much-in-demand inexactness of human hands. The Kota sari has moved with time. Now, they also have a Kota Doria Khadi fabric.
Khadi brings Gandhi in the conversation. Tell the youngsters at the weaver colony the reason for this visit — your search for “Gandhi-ness” in modern India — and they nod their heads. After a strange silence, Imran chips in. “I liked what he said about Swadeshi.”
Udaipur
Day 4: September 24, Tuesday (11 am)
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-6030287 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/gandhi-glasses.jpg"" alt=""Mahatma Gandhi, gandhi jayanti, mahatma gandhi 150th birth anniversary year, mahatma gandhi Sunday eye"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/gandhi-glasses.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/gandhi-glasses.jpg?resize=450,339 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/gandhi-glasses.jpg?resize=600,451 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/gandhi-glasses.jpg?resize=538,405 538w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> Through his eyes: The glasses used by Kingsley in the film Gandhi, now kept in the City Palace Museum, Udaipur.
The guide at the City Palace Museum charges Rs 300 to make you feel miserably poor. Young Mohsin loves talking about royal opulence and waits for your reaction every time he talks about some Maharaja bathing in a giant marble tub with 1,000 silver coins, queens sitting on a 24-carat gold swing, surrounded by maids waiting to dress them with pearls, or of blue-blooded babies sleeping in all-silver cribs.
It’s at one display which celebrates austerity that he gets economical with words. Behind the glass case are Gandhi’s glasses — actually they are the ones Ben Kingsley wore in the multiple Oscar-winning Richard Attenborough classic (1982).
The story goes that the Udaipur royal family was overly hospitable to Attenborough’s crew when they were shooting Gandhi in and around Udaipur, and, as a show of gratitude, the British director gifted the now-famous glasses to Maharana of Mewar Charitable Foundation that runs the museum.
Mohsin says the Gandhi glasses get the foreigners going “Ooooooohh”. He imitates them. For the world, the image of Gandhi is the half-English-half-Indian Kingsley and what was shown in the movie — the sum total of the most famous Indian ever. The fact that it was an over-simplified eulogy is lost on those outside India.
Lawrence and his partner Cynthia live in Southampton, UK. They have seen the movie and have a sense of history. “He was a man with a slight built, he used to wear the loin cloth and those glasses with the fragile-looking frames made him look so docile. But when the world saw him fighting the British, imperialism almost became a moral issue,” says Lawrence.
You bump into the British couple again, this time at the Saraswati library inside the Gulab Park part of the palace premises. After the Kingsley glasses reminded them of Gandhi, they want some books on him. The library is shut. The notice outside the main door informs of a termite attack on the books.
They get excited on seeing the disproportionately towering Gandhi statue — one of many that dot the country — just outside the library. Cynthia asks the questions every Indian wants to ask but somehow hasn’t mustered the conviction to do so.”Was he this tall?” Her partner, minutes after talking about Gandhi’s size, answers: “He was a tall leader, I will say.”
New Delhi
Day 5: September 25, Wednesday (11 am)
While there’s a slow trickle of tourists at Rajghat, the backyard of the Gandhi Darshan arena next doors is pretty crowded. The place has the IGNOU regional centre, Khadi India’s multi-disciplinary training centre and also Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna centre.
Anxious students and worried looking middle-aged men have queued up to collect forms, purchase books or to just make inquries. Some are discussing the job prospects of open courses, others have an interest in papad-making, washing machine repairs or candle-making and several other vocational batches that cost Rs 1,000 a week.
Auto-driver Lakhvinder Sahni, busy folding blank forms and tucking them under the drivers’ seat, is here for the Yojna that promises him vikas. He is from Champaran in Bihar. With pride, he talks about the special bond Bapu shares with his village. He has heard from friends that the two-day initiation programme helps people like him understand their business better and even suggests ideas to diversify on to other things to augment income. “For two days, I will get meals here and also roughly the money that we will lose for not driving the auto,” he says.
A sharp man, Sahni understands politics. “Kejriwal had 100 per cent of the votes back in the day. Now, the BJP is trying to woo us. We are important for Delhi elections. We don’t just vote, we are the best pracharaks. We can change an election.”
Sahni has ‘I love you Kejriwal’ painted on the back of his auto but he says he hasn’t made up his mind. He is divided between the two men who are talking about his vikas.
The man from Champaran says he first got attracted to the Aam Aadmi Party because of the old man who landed in Delhi in 2011, wearing a Gandhi topi. “We thought Anna Hazare would bring a change. It happened but it didn’t last long. They didn’t have the right plan. Gandhi understood the country better. His message was simple and he kept it simple till the end. So things worked,” trails off Sahni.
A hundred-and-fifty years after his birth, Gandhi’s greatness remains his simplicity."

(Source: Planet Lab/Twitter)
India is now home to the world’s tallest statue — Statue of Unity– and with its whopping height of 182 meters, it has garnered considerable attention across the globe. Now, in a picture shared by Planet Lab, world’s leading commercial satellite network, it showed that the giant statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is visible from the space.
The Rs 2,989 crore project took 42 months, and round-the-clock work by 3,400 labourers and 250 engineers to complete the giant structure, which is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US. Sharing a photo on Twitter of the satellite image of the statue built near the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Narmada district, the company wrote, “At 597 feet, India’s Statue of Unity is now the tallest statue in the world and clearly seen from space!” The Oblique SkySat image was captured on November 15, 2018, they added.

The foundation stone of the statue was laid in October 2013 by PM Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat and the height was picked as ‘182’ metre to match the total Assembly constituencies in Gujarat. On October 31 this year on Patel’s birth anniversary, it was inaugurated by PM Modi."

The Kevadia Zoological Park and Safari, located about 2 km from the Statue of Unity, will be opened to public from Tuesday for a short ‘trial run’, officials said. The tickets for the safari are up for sale on the website of the Statue of Unity. Officials said that the park will see a formal inauguration soon.
Spread over an area of 558,240 square metres on the right bank of the Narmada River, downstream the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam, the Safari park will house over 170 species of fauna, covering various biomes of Africa, Australia, Asia and America.
The official website also states, “Visitors will also be able to spot India’s endangered species, which includes the magnificent big cats such as Asiatic lion, Royal Bengal Tiger and leopard. The safari route has been designed such that the visitors can view animal activities, spot reptiles and watch birds.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The park houses two bird aviaries with geodesic design designated for Indian and exotic birds spread over an area of 1.5 hectares. There are 16 different enclosures for carnivores and herbivores and the enclosures for different Indian and exotic species are made catering to habitat requirements of different species.
According to the Dr R R Nala, Director of the Zoological Park, the management is only looking at a trial run. Nala said, “We are testing the facility for teething troubles if any once people start coming in. It will also help get feedback from the visitors and make change or improvements, if needed.” Nala said that while the zoo was looking at receiving about 2,500 tourists per day for the first few days, the number has not yet been capped. “We have not decided on the number of tourists yet. So far, we are beginning with about 2,500. If all goes well, it could go up to 5,000.”
The tickets, priced at Rs 200 per person adult and Rs 125 for children will be available online as well as at the ticket counter in Kevadia, Nala said."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar)
On the 31st of this month, when his mammoth statue is unveiled, India will see the Sardar raised to the sky.
Here’s a slice of history. On January 15, 1948, rebutting stories that Vallabhbhai Patel was a reason for his latest fast, Gandhi frontally rebuked the Sardar’s critics for, as he put it, “isolating [Patel], a lifelong and faithful comrade, from Pandit Nehru and me, whom they gratuitously raise to the sky”. (Collected Works 90:427)
Privately or publicly, some will portray the unveiling as Patel’s liberation, 68 years after his death, from Gandhi and Nehru, and congratulate the statue for soaring past Gandhi and Nehru, leaving the latter two stranded on mere earth.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Others may want to know what the flesh-and-blood Vallabhbhai was really like, and whether, as Gandhi also said in those remarks of January 15, 1948, Vallabhbhai’s heart was “expansive enough to accommodate all” even if his “bluntness of speech sometimes unintentionally hurts”.
Researching the Sardar in the late 1980s, I was staggered by his self-sacrifice.
Early in life he stepped aside to enable older brother Vitthalbhai to study law in London. Later he stepped aside three times to enable Jawaharlal Nehru to become Congress president — in 1929, 1937 and 1946. He did so at Gandhi’s prompting, just as, prodded by Gandhi, he had given up a flourishing legal practice in 1918 to fight for Kheda’s peasants.
In August 1942, when Patel was 67, he along with 53-year-old Nehru, Abul Kalam Azad, who was 54, Kripalani, also 54, Govind Ballabh Pant, 55, Pattabhi Sitaramayya of the Telugu country, who was 62, and six other Congress Working Committee members entered the 16th-century Ahmednagar Fort. It would be their prison for three years while a world war raged outside.
They were allowed only the slenderest contact with relatives, and none whatever with Gandhi, who was held at another detention site in the Marathi country, Pune’s Aga Khan Palace.
Letters from the prisoners to their families, diaries that Nehru and Pattabhi kept during the incarceration, and an oral history later provided by the youngest prisoner, Odisha’s Hare Krushna Mahtab, 42, tell a story of clashes and truces, bridge games and badminton in a historic fort. It would make for a riveting movie.
Six inmates wrote a book each in prison: Nehru, Azad, Pattabhi, Kripalani, Narendra Deva and Mahtab. As for the oldest prisoner, Patel, he read book after book from the Fort’s limited library, soaked up every line in the few newspapers that were let in, made thread with his charkha, walked numberless times up and down a 200-foot path, played bridge, and grew flowers.
Patel proved an expert maali, as did Nehru. Pattabhi noted that a “heavenly blue morning glory creeper” grown by the Sardar became “the talk” of the Fort. Patel’s greatest role, however, was to preserve the prisoners’ morale by making them laugh. “He chokes you with laughter by his sharp and incisive wit,” Pattabhi recorded.
When a Major General Candy, Bombay presidency’s surgeon-general, visited to check on the Empire’s prisoners and asked Patel, whom he had met in Ahmedabad 18 years previously, if his age was around 58, the Sardar answered: “I am 67 and looking forward to another 33 years.” (Pattabhi, Feathers & Stones)
Flint-like before the foe, Patel’s heart softened when he remembered co-workers and their families, enquiring after each member when letters were allowed to go out.
In the Sardar, sacrifice, fortitude and empathy were joined by a sense of responsibility and loyalty. Gandhi’s assassination almost shattered Home Minister Patel. Four days thereafter, on February 3, 1948, a letter published in The Statesman asked for the Sardar’s resignation, while JP remarked that “at 74 Patel was holding departments” that were too much “even for a man of thirty”. (The Times of India, February 4, 1948)
That day Patel wrote a letter to Nehru calling the demand for his exit “justified” and offered to resign, but he did not send the letter (SPC 6: 27-28). He did not then know what Nehru had written that same day, February 3: “My dear Vallabhbhai, with Bapu’s death, we have to face a different and more difficult world. I have been greatly distressed by the persistence of whispers about you and me, magnifying out of all proportion any differences we may have. We must put an end to this mischief.
“For over a quarter century, you and I have faced many storms and perils together. In this crisis we now face, I think it is my duty, and if I may venture to say yours also, for us to face it together as friends and colleagues, not merely superficially but in full loyalty to one another and with confidence in one another.”
Vallabhbhai replied (February 5): “I am deeply touched, indeed overwhelmed by… your letter. We have been lifelong comrades… The paramount interests of our country and our mutual love and regard, transcending such differences of outlook and temperament as existed, have held us together. I had the good fortune to have a last talk with Bapu for over an hour just before his death. His opinion also binds us both.” (SPC 6: 29-31)
Witnessing sharp conflicts but also overcoming them, their partnership until Patel’s death in December 1950 enabled the enactment of a Constitution assuring equal rights to all Indians and the merger of princely states into the Union of India."

A PANDAL, a complimentary banquet hall, e-invites, henna artists, music, all-day meals, including starters and mocktails — and of course, hand sanitisers, social distancing and seating only for 50.
Bookings are open for customised wedding packages in the Statue of Unity complex, with the Gujarat government planning to open up tourist destinations after the three-month Covid lockdown.
The wedding venue is Statue of Unity Tent City 1, located on Dyke 4 of the Narmada Dam about 4 km from the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The picturesque location and open-to-sky setting with Statue of Unity and Narmada Dam in the backdrop makes for a perfect destination wedding,” says Chetan Verma, Manager-Operations, Statue of Unity Tent City 1, which has 60 tents and two “Presidential Cottages”.
“We have drawn up packages for 50 persons as per the state government’s Covid guidelines. The cost per package is about Rs 2.5 lakh, which is extremely affordable as our cottages cost about Rs 12,000 each per night at the regular price (before the lockdown),” says Verma.
Tent City 1 is being developed, operated and managed by Lallooji and Sons, an Ahmedabad-based event management company, on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model.
Officials say that ever since it opened on October 27 last year, it has mainly hosted official events, starting with the World Bank Conference, which saw the participation of World Bank CEO David Malpass, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.
Over the next five months, until the lockdown in March, three weddings were held, including that of the daughter of Principal Secretary (Health) Dr Jayanti Ravi.
Before the lockdown, the complex drew an average of 15,000 visitors on weekdays and 22,000 over weekends.
Says Nilesh Dubey, Kevadia Deputy Collector and Chief Administrator of Statue of Unity: “Promoting the location for destination weddings is a good idea, and will be good for the Statue of Unity in the long run. We don’t have word yet on when tourist spots can open, but we are prepared. The Tent City is open.”"

A dinosaur park, named after the 22-foot Rajasaurus dinosaurs believed to have roamed the Narmada valley about 65 million years ago, is among the 30-odd projects planned at Kevadia Colony — near the Statue of Unity (SoU) — that are expected to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31. The occasion marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
“There are over 30 projects going on at Kevadia Colony. Around 60 contractors have been engaged to complete them well before October 31. We are expecting the Prime Minister to inaugurate these projects,” said MB Joshi, Chief General Manager (Technical and Coordination), of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL).
Last year on October 31, PM Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity. “These projects are coming up in a 20-kilometre area around the Statue of Unity,” the official said, adding that three entities, including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) and the forest department, were in charge of the projects at Kevadia Colony.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The biggest of the 30-odd projects at the site is the “jungle safari” for which a society has been formed to manage and operate it over 130 acres of forest that will house giraffes and African cheetahs. “While some of the exotic species are being brought to Gujarat as per animal exchange programme with different countries, a few others are being bought from other countries,” said Joshi. “The exotic animals will be first kept at the GEER (Gujarat Ecological Education and Research) foundation’s Indroda Park in Gandhinagar and Sakkarbaug zoo in Junagadh for acclimatisation,” he said.
The Dinosaur Park named after Rajasaurus Narmadensis whose fossils found from the Narmada valley date to the Late Cretaceous period, will have 70-foot sculptures of the species erected on three hilltops that dot the landscape where trekking facilities are being planned.
Earlier this year, about 170 kilometres away from Kevadia, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani inaugurated a Dinosaur Museum and fossil park at Raiyoli village in Balasinor of Mahisagar district, the third largest hatchery of Rajasaurus Narmadensis in the world. Apart from this, special jetties are being built under the guidance of Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) to facilitate boating in a special navigational channel that will connect Shreshtra Bharat Bhavan with the SoU. This will be part of the Garudeshwar weir project that entails creation of a reservoir surrouding the SoU downstream from the dam.
“The work on these projects began in March 2019 and we are looking to complete most of them in time for the inauguration by the Prime Minister,” the official added. Other projects coming up on the site include Children’s Nutrition Park, Valley of Flowers, Mirror Maze, Vishwa Van, Cactus Garden, Ekta Nursery, Arogya Van, Aquarium, Butterfly Garden, Shreshta Bharat Bhavan, Narmada Nihar and Ekta Dwar.
“While building these projects, we are strictly going by the vision of the Prime Minister. When he came to inaugurate the SoU, he gave some suggestions, including a few to boost the local economy. We have built these projects accordingly,” said Joshi. Projects that have been conceived to involve the local tribal population in and around SoU include the Ekta Mall and Ekta Nursery where tribal will be able to conduct live display of their skills and sell their produce to the tourists.
However, some of these projects are refurbishments of existing structures, including the Ekta Auditorium project that was a community hall that was built for SSNNL employees living in Kevadia Colony. Budget tourist accommodation project involves overhaul of 126 SSNNL quarters that were in a dilapidated condition.
An official of the Gujarat forest department earlier told this paper that over 1,500 animals of various species will be housed in the safari area, including giraffes, kangaroos, pandas, koalas and ostriches. “Proposals to channelise the import of the animals are being worked on. The animals will be housed in open spaces that mimic their natural habitats, and visitors will move around in electric cars,” the official said."

Puddles and leaking roofs Saturday welcomed the visitors at the Statue of Unity, which is experiencing its first monsoon after its inauguration in October last year.
The roof of its exhibition hall was leaking, while tourists waded through the puddles at the viewing gallery of the statue, which is at a height of 153 m, on Saturday morning as heavy rainfall continued to lash several parts of Gujarat. Rainwater seeped in the viewing gallery through the open iron mesh installed on the periphery. Videos of water dripping from the ceiling of the gallery also went viral in no time on Saturday morning as rain intensified overnight.
Officials, however, stated that the accumulation of water on the floor of the viewing gallery could not be termed as leakage.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Water accumulated in the gallery as it is open. The entire purpose of keeping the viewing gallery open is to allow the people to enjoy the scenic beauty of the place. There is a glass enclosure at the back and there is no water there. However the front of the gallery at the chest (level of the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel) is open as per the design and it is natural that the rainwater will come inside the standing area. There is no leakage in this part as the water dripping from the ceiling is also just a trail of the same rainwater,” I K Patel, Chief Executive Officer of the Statue of Unity, told The Sunday Express.
Patel, however, agreed that water leaked through the ceiling of the exhibition hall, on Saturday."

In the wake of a spate of attacks on migrants, especially from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in Gujarat, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Monday sought to reassure people, saying Gujarat is a “mini India” where everyone is secure and respected.
He termed the attacks against Hindi-speaking migrants in his state as “politically motivated and a planned conspiracy of the Congress”.
Speaking at an event in Lucknow on Monday, Rupani said: “Hum sablog Bharat mata ki santan hain, Uttar Pradesh ho, Gujarat ho… Hum sab ek hain. Is ekta ko todne ke liye Bharat virodhi tatva kaam kar rahe hain (We are all children of Mother India, be it UP or Gujarat… We are all one… Those against this unity are working to destroy it).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Crediting the hard work of people from UP and Bihar for helping Gujarat develop, the Chief Minister said, “Gujarat has been progressing as people from UP, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra have all played a part,” he said.
“Yeh Gandhi ka Gujarat hai, Yeh Patel ka Gujarat, Modi ji ka Gujarat hai. Bharat ke sab vasiyon ka laghu Bharat Gujarat hai… Yahan Bharat ke sabhi wasion ka samman, suraksha hai… Gujarat ne sabko sambhala hai (Gujarat is of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Narendra Modi. It is a mini-India. Here every citizen of the country is respected, given security… Gujarat has taken care of all).”
Rupani, who was in Lucknow to personally invite his UP counterpart to the inauguration of the Statue of Unity on October 31, later accused the Congress for the attacks on the migrants during a joint press conference with Yogi Adityanath.
Without naming Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor, who has been accused by the ruling BJP for inciting anti-migrant protests in Gujarat following the rape of a 14-month-old girl allegedly by a labourer from Bihar, Rupani said: “It was a planned conspiracy of (a) Congress MLA… Elections are slated in four states and the ‘Statue of Unity’ is all set to be unveiled… Therefore, Congress tried to create problems. But the Gujarat government foiled all such efforts and there is complete peace in the state now.”
Rupani said that his government took strict measures and normalcy has returned in the state, after it was hit by a spate of attacks on Hindi-speaking migrants, mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. “At least 715 people have been arrested of which more than 50 are Congressmen… About 76 people were arrested for spreading incendiary messages on social media and many of them were from the Congress party,” he said, adding that over 63 cases have been filed. He also claimed that no untoward incident has taken place in the state for the past several days.
Rupani also said that legal action will be taken against the Congress MLA for inflammatory speech.
In an oblique reference to Shaktisinh Gohil, Rupani said incidentally a Congress leader, who is the in-charge for party affairs in Bihar, is talking about “throwing Biharis out”.
Gohil is the AICC in-charge for Bihar. He also asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to take action against the leader.

Congress workers Sunday tried to show black flags to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on his visit to UP."

The policy seeks to make Gujarat a hub of “MICE” tourism.
What is MICE tourism?
The acronym “MICE” stands for “Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions”, and is essentially a version of business tourism that draws domestic and international tourists to a destination.
The policy aims to make Gujarat one of the top five MICE tourism destinations in the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
How does the policy propose to attract MICE tourism?
To incentivise international events, the government has announced an assistance of Rs 5,000 to the event organiser per foreign participant staying overnight, subject to an upper limit of Rs 5 lakh.
For domestic events, the policy promises financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh per event, capped at three events per organiser per year.
Rupani said that for Gujarat to emerge as a venue of big national and international conferences, large convention centres are required. The policy promises special incentives for building big convention centres, including 15% capital subsidy on the eligible capital investment.
The government has also promised land on lease, if required. A precondition to avail the incentive is that the convention centre should have at least one hall that can seat a minimum of 2,500 persons.

Which are the MICE destinations in Gujarat currently?
The Mahatma Mandir Convention and Exhibition Centre in Gandhinagar, which was built as the venue for the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Global Investment Summit when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister, can seat up to 5,000 persons.
The Dandi Kutir at the complex, built in the shape of a salt mound, houses a multimedia museum dedicated to Gandhi. It hosted the 13th UN Convention on Migratory Species (CMS COP13) meeting in February last year.
The Tent City near Kevadia in Narmada district of central Gujarat is billed as an ideal conference venue for 100 to 1,000 delegates. The national presiding officers’ conference, which was opened by President Ram Nath Kovind in November, was held in Kevadia.
The Tent City at Dhordo in the White Desert of Kutch hosted the national DG Conference in 2015.
But why is there specific focus on MICE tourism?
A senior government official said MICE events are major tourism generators, and there is significant scope for Gujarat to tap into it.
“By incentivising the organising of MICE events and construction of convention centres in Gujarat, we are trying to plug the gaps [in MICE tourism potential]. The organiser of an international event can prolong the stay of guests by one or two days, and visitors can visit tourist attractions, of which Gujarat has many,” the official said.

IN A studio in Noida in the National Capital Region lie three statues of Shivaji, each 0.762 metres (2.5 ft) in height, and a fourth one outside, stands at 8.22 metres (26.9 ft). The tallest one, built a year ago, will eventually serve as the model for the 121.2-metre (397.63-foot) statue of the Maratha ruler to be raised on a reclaimed island off Mumbai coast, as one of the tallest statues in the world.
Last month, The Indian Express reported that the Maharashtra government was planning to cut the height of Shivaji in the statue by 7.5 metres (from 83.2 metres) and instead increase the height of his sword in it by 7.5 metres (from 38 metres), to retain the overall height of the structure. The original base length is also being proportionally reduced, with the cuts in the amount of bronze, tertiary steel elements and armature expected to reduce costs by around Rs 338.94 crore.
With the Opposition calling the changes to the ‘Shiv Smarak’ an “insult” to Shivaji, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said alterations to the pedestal height of the structure were required “to provide a solid formation for high wind pressure in the middle of the sea”. However, he has remained mum on changes in the design of the statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At the Noida studio, award-winning sculptor Ram V Sutar (93), who was tasked with the job a year ago, says he has no idea about these changes. Son Anil (60), who helps out his father, adds, “It doesn’t work like that. It will ruin the proportion of the sculpture, it will look funny. Anyway, we haven’t been approached regarding this by the state government so far.”
Sutar is the go-to sculptor for governments across India — from Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to Mayawati and the BJP — seeking to build prestigious statues. The Padma Bhushan awardee is currently building not just one statue seeking to be “world’s tallest” but two — the other being the 182-metre (597-foot) Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel coming up near the Narmada dam in Gujarat, a pet project of the BJP governments at the state and Centre.
Besides, Sutar is also working on the war memorial coming up at India Gate, where 21 busts of Param Vir Chakra recipients and six murals of various wars that India has fought since 1947 would be displayed. The war memorial was recently in the news when the Delhi High Court questioned the “secrecy” around the construction.
The race against time requires Sutar to clock in eight-hour days at his Noida studio. With the sculptor also working on several smaller projects, he says he has no time for breaks. At any given time, 25-30 men are at work on various statues, with Sutar monitoring each of them. The average size of a statue at the studio is 1.8 metres (5.9 ft), and it takes around two months to finish one.

(Express photo/Praveen Khanna)
Since Sutar got the Statue of Unity project in 2016, he has also been making frequent trips to the foundry in Nanjing, China, where the structure is being cast in bronze. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to inaugurate the statue on October 31, Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary.
Says Anil, “In China, we told the workers how to texture the statue. Unlike the smooth Gautam Buddha statues they make… (the Patel statue will capture) the threads of the shawl, the way his chin was, the eyebrows… all his features have to be evident.”
As Anil shows a photo of the two of them telling foundry workers how to fix one of Patel’s toenails — he says he told them to “add more skin” — Sutar says, “Since the government talks about ‘Make in India’, I thought this statue too would be made here, but it’s now ‘Made in China’ you can say.”
While the statue’s concrete structure is being made on site in Gujarat, the bronze cladding, which will include the intricate contours of Patel’s face and frame, has been put together at the foundry.
Says Anil, “Since Patel was responsible for consolidating India in 1947, we wanted to get artistes from across the country and build it in a foundry here. But the government wanted it done in China due to better infrastructure there. The job needed to be done quickly.”
The bronze cladding, made in parts in China, was by turns shipped to Gujarat, where the statue is now being welded together on site by close to 2,400 workers. Sutar and his son are to visit soon for the final touches.
Chuckling as he rattles off the numbers, the 93-year-old says, “The pedestal is 26-metre high, the statue is 159 metres. Sardar Patel’s head alone is 21.3 metres, while the eyeballs are 1.8 metres (6 ft) each.” Letting in on a “secret”, he adds, “The statue’s ankles are thicker than they are supposed to be because there is an elevator inside (to take visitors up to the level of the chest of the statue, where there will be a visitors’ gallery).”
In case of the Shiv Smarak, Sutar and Anil are not too sure when the work will begin, especially with the planned changes. “When the sculptures are small, the structure isn’t very important… But in these cases, the statues have to withstand wind pressure. We have to coordinate with structural engineers, amalgamate structural stability with aesthetics.”
Being part of two of the world’s tallest statues — currently the distinction is held by China’s Spring Temple Buddha (128 metres) — is a 70-year-old dream come true for him, adds Sutar. When the sculptor, from a small village in Maharashtra, was in his 20s, an art teacher showed him a picture of the Statue of Liberty. That’s when he first dreamt of creating the tallest statue, he says. “One that would touch the skies.” At 185 metres, the Statue of Unity would be almost double the size.
To those who question the purpose of these statues, Sutar says, “Since the Stone Age and Bronze Age, statues are being built in remembrance… How can this be futile?”
Meanwhile, yet another prestigious BJP project may come his way. The Uttar Pradesh government wants to put up a statue of Lord Ram in Ayodhya, and Sutar is working on a proposal for it. “It’s supposed to be 70-metre tall,” smiles Anil."

Union minister for mines and steel Narendra Singh Tomar said Saturday that he would urge prime minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley to increase on the import duty on steel to curb “Chinese dumping” since the Indian steel industry had not been able to utilise its established production capacity. Tomar was speaking at the inauguration of the four-day INDINOX 2015, touted to be the world’s biggest integrated stainless steel exhibition, organised by Indian Stainless Steel Development Organisation (ISDO) at Mahatma Mandir. A stainless steel statue of Mahatma Gandhi was also put on display at the event.
Chief minister Anandiben Patel said that the steel processing industry in Gujarat was developed despite the non-availability of iron ores in the state and also agreed to consider a proposal to set up a steel cultural park on the Sabarmati Riverfront.
She added that her government would shortly announce labour reforms. The government is learnt to have cleared labour reforms earlier this week, but has not yet made it public. Patel sought a concrete proposal for the Riverfront park, the land for which, she said, would be allotted in consultation with the municipal corporation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) president N C Mathur warned that the contribution of China in the global production has gone up from 30 per cent to 50 per cent but India has been lagging behind. “The per capita consumption of stainless steel was 1.9 kg in India against the world average of 6 kg. So, there is tremendous scope of growth for the industry in India”, he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Asia Pacific head of Outokumpu, world’s largest stainless steel-making company, Austin Lu, said, “ The statue of Unity, a mammoth tribute to the iron man of India, to be built at the Sadhu-bet island in Narmada district, has been designed to last for about 100 years.

The first half of 1947 was a critical period in India’s history. The end of colonial rule was certain and so was India’s partition but what was uncertain was whether there would be more than one division. Prices were rising, food shortages were common but over and above everything else, the unity of India was under severe strain.
It was in these circumstances that the states department came into being in the middle of 1947. Among the chief aims of this department was to negotiate India’s relationship with the over 550 princely states, which were as diverse as they could get, be it in size, population, terrain or economic situation. No wonder Mahatma Gandhi remarked, “The problem of the states is so difficult that YOU alone can solve it.” The YOU in question is none other than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, whose jayanti we are marking today and to whom we pay our tributes.

In vintage Sardar Patel style, he went about his work with precision, firmness and administrative efficiency. Time was less and the task was herculean. But this was no ordinary person, it was Sardar Patel, who was determined not to let his nation down. One by one, he and his team negotiated with the princely states and ensured that they all became a part of free India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It was due to the round-the-clock effort of Patel that the map of India is what it is today!

Once freedom was won, V P Menon, it is said, wanted to retire from government service, only to be told by Patel that this was neither the time to rest nor the time to retire. Such was Patel’s firm resolve that Menon was made the secretary of the state’s department. In his book, The Story of the Integration of Indian States, he writes about how Patel led from the front and inspired the entire team to work assiduously. He also writes that Patel was clear — first and foremost came the interests of the people of India, there would be no compromise on that.

On August 15, 1947, we celebrated the dawn of a new destiny but the work of nation building was far from complete. As Independent India’s first home minister, he set the stage for an administrative framework that continues to serve the nation be it in matters of day-to-day governance or protecting the interests of the people, particularly the poor and marginalised.
Patel was a veteran administrator. His own experience in governance, particularly in the 1920s, when he served the Ahmedabad municipality, was extremely handy when he worked towards strengthening independent India’s administrative framework. While in Ahmedabad, he did commendable work in furthering cleanliness in the city. He ensured clean and functioning drainage systems across the city. He also focussed on other aspects of urban infrastructure such as roads, electricity and education.
Today, if India is known for a vibrant cooperative sector, a large part of the credit goes to Sardar Patel.
The roots of Amul can be traced back to his vision for empowering local communities, particularly women. It was Patel who also popularised the idea of cooperative housing societies, thus ensuring dignity and shelter for many.
Two traits synonymous with Patel are trust and integrity. The farmers of India had unparalleled faith in him. After all, he was a kisan putra, who led from the front during the Bardoli Satyagraha. The working class saw him as a ray of hope, a leader who would speak up for them. Traders and industrialists preferred to work with Patel because they felt here was a stalwart who had a vision for India’s economic and industrial growth.

His political peers too trusted him. Acharya Kripalani remarked that whenever they faced an issue and if Bapu’s guidance was not available, they would turn to Patel. When political negotiations were at their peak in 1947, Sarojini Naidu called him “the man of decision and man of action”. Everyone trusted him, his words and his actions. Patel continues to be respected across caste, creed, faith, age!
This year’s Sardar Jayanti is even more special.
With the blessings of 130 crore Indians, the “Statue of Unity” is being inaugurated today. Situated on the banks of the Narmada, the “Statue of Unity” is among the tallest in the world. “Dharti Putra” Sardar Patel will stand tall in the skies, to guide us and inspire us.
I congratulate all those who have worked day and night to ensure that this grand statue in tribute of Sardar Patel becomes a reality. My mind goes back to October 31, 2013, when we laid the foundation stone for this ambitious project. In record time, a project of such scale has become ready and this should make every Indian proud. I urge you all to visit the “Statue of Unity” in the times to come.
The “Statue of Unity” is a symbol of both the unity of hearts and the geographical integrity of our motherland. It is a reminder that divided, we may not be even able to face ourselves. United, we can face the world and scale new heights of growth and glory.
Sardar Patel worked with astonishing speed to dismantle the history of imperialism and create the geography of unity with the spirit of nationalism. He saved India from Balkanisation and integrated even the weakest of limbs into the national framework. Today, we, the 130 crore Indians are working shoulder to shoulder to build a New India that is strong, prosperous and inclusive. Every decision is being taken to ensure that the fruits of development reach the most vulnerable, without any corruption or favouritism, just as Patel would have wanted it."

(File)
On a day Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, the world’s tallest, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in a subtle dig at the BJP, said the Iron Man of India was a “Congressman” who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism.
Paying tribute to Patel on his 143rd birth anniversary, Gandhi said, “Sardar Patel was a patriot, who fought for an independent, united & secular India. A man with a steely will, tempered by compassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism. On his birth anniversary, I salute this great son of India.”

The ‘Statue of Unity’, built on islet Sadhu Bet near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat’s Narmada district, was dedicated to the nation by PM Modi in a grand event that was planned on the scale of the Republic Day celebrations and was attended by Gujarat Governor O P Kohli, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and BJP chief Amit Shah.

In another tweet, Gandhi accused the government of “treason”, saying there was a “systematic destruction” of institutions that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had helped in building. Patel, the first Home Minister of Independent India, is credited with uniting 500 princely states into the Union.

“Ironic that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being smashed. The systematic destruction of India’s institutions is nothing short of treason,” Gandhi said.
The Congress chief’s remarks come on the back of a tiff between the RBI and the government over interference in the central bank’s functioning and the ongoing crisis in the CBI."

About the statue
It overlooks the Narmada river in the state of Gujarat. Designed by Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar — and inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 143rd birth anniversary of Vallabhbhai Patel in October 2018 — the statue’s total project cost was a staggering Rs 2,989 crore (US$420 million).

World’s tallesthttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Statue of Unity broke the previously-held record of the Spring Temple Buddha in China’s Henan province. The Buddha stands at 153 metres (502 ft). Previously, the tallest statue in India was that of Hanuman (41 metres, 135 ft) at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh.
Other remarkable places that were featured in Time’s list include: The National Museum of Qatar, Canada’s Wonderland in Toronto, National Comedy Center Jamestown, New York, traditional Chinese theatre Xiqu Centre in Hong Kong, and the Helsinki Central Library Oodi, to name a few.

(Representational)
EARLIER THIS year, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar triggered a debate when he made a public request for installing a battle tank on the campus. However, he is not alone in asking for obsolete battle tanks and guns from the Army. Over the past two years, the demand from private organisations, educational institutions, schools, colleges and NGOs for such tanks and other combat equipment has gone up significantly.
In 2014-15, only three such demands were received from civilian institutions. The number rose to seven in 2015-16 and then shot up to 31 in 2016-17. The Army has already received another 31 requests for battle tanks in the first half of the current financial year. Among the educational institutions which have been given such tanks by the Army since 2013 are: Modern School, New Delhi (one Vijayanta tank), Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, Rampur (one T-55 tank), La Martiniere College, Lucknow (one T-55 tank), Lawrence School, Sanawar (one T-55 tank), Dalhousie Public School, Himachal Pradesh (two RCL guns), Punjabi University, Patiala (one Vijayanta tank), Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune (one T-55 tank against two demanded), Punjab Public School, Nabha (one T-55 tank against two demanded), and Rajkumar College, Raipur (one T-55 tank against two demanded).
The debate over display of battle tanks in educational institutions gained prominence earlier this year, following a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ event at JNU on July 23, where Vice-Chancellor Kumar publicly requested Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and former army chief and Minister of State for External Affairs General V K Singh (retd) to help the university in “procuring an Army tank”. He said this could be displayed at a “prominent place” on the campus to serve as a “constant” reminder to students of the sacrifices the Army makes.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Besides educational institutions, the Army has also issued a large number of phased out/ obsolete tanks in bulk to civilian government organisations in various states since 2013. While four Vijayanta tanks and 19 RCL guns were issued for Punjab State War Heroes Memorial-cum-Museum at Amritsar in 2016-17, the Lion Safari Park in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, has also received five Vijayanta tanks from the Army.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-4911555"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/jnu-tanks-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""639"" height=""406"" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/jnu-tanks-1.jpg 639w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/jnu-tanks-1.jpg?resize=450,286 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/jnu-tanks-1.jpg?resize=600,381 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/jnu-tanks-1.jpg?resize=637,405 637w"" sizes=""(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px"" />
But the maximum number of battle tanks — 40 Vijayanta tanks — issued to any single institution are to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) in Gujarat. In 2015-16, the Army issued these tanks to SVPRET, which is a special purpose vehicle created by the Gujarat government for the execution of the Statue of Unity project. The State of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is slated to be the world’s largest statue at 182 metres. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2018.
When contacted, a senior official of SVPRET told The Sunday Express: “When we began the project, we were looking out for good quality metal that could be used to construct the statue. We thought, what could be better than Army tanks. We sought the tanks from the Army, but when we conducted a metallurgical study of the same, we realised that the metal of the war tanks was of a far superior quality than what we were looking for. To extract the kind of metal we needed for the statue from these tanks was going to be uneconomical. Therefore, we dropped the idea.”
While another officer working on the project said the committee had discussed the option of using the tanks to create a museum as an added attraction for tourists visiting Kevadia to see the Statue of Unity, the top SVPRET official denied such plans. “We have no plan to use the Army tanks now. We have told the Army that we do not need them anymore,” he said.
The overall stock of obsolete battle tanks and guns for issue is limited to the equipment declared surplus in the previous financial year, out of which, 20 per cent is allocated for issue to private organisations/ educational institutions/ colleges/ schools/ NGOs and others. These organisations have to pay 5 per cent of the book value of the equipment, besides bearing the cost of transportation.
The allocations are made on a ‘first come first serve’ basis, with a proviso that the ministry can make up to 10 per cent out-of-turn allotments. As per the Army, no out-of-turn allotments of obsolete military equipment have been made by the ministry so far."

Referring to the Statue of Unity, the 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel built near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat, he said, “The Statue of Unity watches over the Governor of Meghalaya and others who seem to think that Kashmiris have no place in India.”

Chidambaram’s remarks came amid attacks on Kashmiris after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed after a suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy on February 14. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility for the attack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court today agreed to hear a petition highlighting the alleged targeting of Kashmiri students in the country. The plea alleged that students from Kashmir Valley are being attacked at different educational institutions across the country after the Pulwama terror attack and authorities concerned should be directed to take actions to stop such assaults.
In Dehradun, Kashmiri students were forced to flee to their home state, while the administrators of their colleges have been made to pledge that they will not admit any Kashmiri in the future. In at least one case, a senior faculty member of Kashmiri origin was dismissed from his post. An estimated 3,000 students from Kashmir currently attend colleges and institutes in Dehradun.
However, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday dismissed reports of alleged harassment of Kashmiri students outside their state and said, “There is massive anger in the country against the Pulwama terror attack. However, I want to clarify that what you are trying to say (about Kashmiri students being attacked) is not true. We are in touch with all institutes and no such incident has happened.”"

(PTI)
Days after The Indian Express reported the state government’s decision to relocate hundreds of crocodiles from Pond 3 and 4 of the Narmada Dam in Kevadia colony to clear path for the sea plane terminal connecting the Statue of Unity, the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) has written to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to immediately discontinue the exercise.
The letter, which cites the report in The Indian Express, highlights the fact that the reptile is an endangered species classified under the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. The letter also cites a concern raised by experts in the report published by this newspaper that releasing crocodiles into the reservoir will hamper their nesting abilities owing to the slope of the dam.
The letter states, “It will also increase the chances of poaching of the crocodiles, which is already a major challenge in its conservation.” The organisation recommends “a study on reducing the human crocodile conflict instead of relocating the entire population of crocodiles” as well as ensuring that “unregulated tourism does not harm the ecosystem of the area”.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani claimed Thursday that the state has “zero-level unrest” and is considered an “ideal state” for migrants.
His comments came weeks after thousands of Hindi-speaking migrants, many of them factory workers, fled the state following attacks targeting them.
Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) here, Rupani said there is “industrial peace” in the state.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Gujarat has business-friendly atmosphere and zero-level unrest. As a result, Gujarat is considered an ideal state for migration,” he said, addressing business delegates of the National Executive Committee of FICCI.
“Gujarat has industrial peace. Due to this favourable working atmosphere, industries are not facing any difficulties here. Industries are reaping benefit of the industrial peace prevailing in Gujarat,” Rupani added.
He listed various initiatives of his government to encourage investment, and said efforts are also being made to ensure that more local people are employed by the industries.
An alleged rape of a 14-month-old girl and the arrest of a worker from Bihar in the case sparked off attacks on Hindi-speaking migrants in the state a few weeks ago. It led to thousands of migrant workers fleeing the state.
During the week-long unrest, mostly in north and central Gujarat, protesters also targeted some factories, alleging that they preferred migrants over the local youth.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The chief minister also appealed the FICCI and industrialists to hold their conferences or conventions at the facilities built at the site of the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya, inaugurated by the prime minister Wednesday."

The management of the Statue of Unity (SoU), located in Kevadia colony of Narmada district, served a notice to its contracting company Larsen & Tubro (L&T) on Friday, in view of at least 400 workers having protested the non-payment of their salaries since the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown in March. Following the notice by the Chief Administrator of SoU, the company is said to have instantly cleared the wages, officials said.
On Friday morning, the SoU management in a statement confirmed that L&T, which has constructed the statue and is also responsible for the maintenance of the site, had defaulted on the payment of wages to its outsourced employees — mostly the housekeeping staff and security personnel.

The company immediately made the payment this afternoon to all the employees. It has not yet given us any explanation for the delay, but we will levy a penalty for the default. It is very clear, even in the government guidelines, that salaries cannot be held up during the lockdown period.”"

Close to 20 tourists were injured Saturday when two luxury buses collided and one of them overturned at Navagam in Kevadia colony, about 2 kilometers from the Statue of Unity. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon as over 25,000 footfall was recorded at the site owing to the weekend crowds.
The two private luxury buses speeding towards the Statue of Unity collided with each other —  the impact resulting in one of the two buses overturning and injuring over 20 passengers. While six of the injured were rushed to Vadodara’s civil hospital for treatment about 90 Kms away, the rest of the injured were taken to the Garudeshwar referral hospital for administering first aid.
According to officials, the accident occurred due to over speeding near Navagam. “Eyewitnesses have told us that the buses were speeding and perhaps attempting to make a u-turn towards statue of unity again. The driver of the second bus rammed into the rear of the first with an impact that was enough to make it turn over. A crane had to be called in to lift up the bus. So naturally, passengers in the bus were injured,” an official said. The number of visitors on Saturday, which is a day off in most parts of the city owing to Janmashtmi, had crossed 24000, officials said, adding that more rush can be expected on Sunday.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A press release from the state government stated that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has announced full compensation for the medical expenses incurred by the injured. According to the release, an 18-year-old resident Kinni Patel of Vadodara, who was among the injured tourists was airlifted from Kevadia to Vadodara by the tourist helicopter stationed at Statue of Unity for immediate treatment and thereafter airlifted to Ahmedabad.
The release stated, “Vadodara District Collector Shalini Agarwal ensured that the SSG hospital was prepared to treat her immediately after receiving her at the airport. However, since her injuries were extremely grave, she was airlifted again to Ahmedabad. The entire journey from the airport to the hospital and back to the airport to be airlifted to Ahmedabad was carried out under police patrol to avoid any delays.”
According to IK Patel, Collector Narmada district and CEO of SoU, “The girl was airlifted to Vadodara and taken to a private hospital but it was felt that she would have to be given even better treatment and was airlifted by the tourist helicopter to Ahmedabad. Most other injured passengers were treated at the Garudeshwar health center and also shifted to the Rajpipla health center for treatment. One injured person was also shifted to SSG hospital in Vadodara.”"

Express
Within 10 days of being opened for the public, the Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in Narmada district is witnessing heavy footfall. For the second consecutive day on Saturday, the ticket window at the statue had to be closed within a few hours of opening.
As many as 28,409 tourists, the highest so far, visited the statue on Saturday, taking the single day collection to Rs 48.44 lakh. The statue has made a total collection of Rs 1.26 crore within three days since November 8.
While the officials had pegged the expected number of visitors at 15,000 for the weekend on account of Diwali, Hindu New Year and Bhai Dooj, the number increased to 17,280 on Thursday itself. On Friday, the number increased to around 23,000.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official said, “Each elevator up to the viewing gallery has a capacity of 25. The capacity of the elevator is around 600 to 700 per hour, depending on how long one stays at the top. The gallery can accommodate 200 persons at a time. Hence, the per day capacity is about 6,000 of which 1,000 tickets are online as of now and the rest are sold on site.”
Owing to such huge number of visitors, the ticket counters were closed early, leaving many disappointed as they could not visit the viewing gallery. On Saturday, after tickets for entry to the viewing gallery were sold to a maximum capacity of 6,973 persons, the ticket counters were closed at 10.30 am. “We accommodated tourists to the maximum capacity but many were left disappointed,” an official said.
The tourists have blamed a lack of management at the site. While some took to social media to express their disappointment, others targeted tour operators from Vadodara that had booked trips to the statue.
One of the tour operators said, “We took 56 visitors to the site but they couldn’t go up to the gallery as the tickets were sold out. They had queued up at 7.30 am and at 1 pm they were told that tickets won’t be issued. In such situations, the booking counters must ensure that the queue is only as long as the available tickets. In the end, the tour operators were blamed for the fiasco.”
Another visitor complained of a lack of shuttle buses from the parking lot to the site. “Private cars are not allowed beyond the parking lot. Visitors have to rely on the shuttle buses for which they pay separately. But the management at the site is unable to provide enough buses,” said Trupti Patel, who visited the site on Friday.
Sources in SVPRET (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust), which manages the Statue, said that considering Friday’s turn out, the government had decided to cap tickets early morning Saturday so as to not disappoint waiting tourists.
However, the area witnessed an 8-km long traffic jam on Saturday on the Dabhoi-Kevadia highway owing to the rush of visitors. Vadodara police had be roped in to assist Narmada police for security arrangements.
Confirming the high number of visitors on Saturday, Narmada District Collector R S Ninama said the administration was expecting the figure to increase further on Sunday. “The number of shuttle buses has been increased from 15 to 40 for Sunday,” PTI quoted him as saying.
A government release appealed to the visitors “to plan their trip keeping in mind the timing as well as the capacity of the infrastructure at the Statue of Unity”."

At 153 metres, the viewing gallery at the Statue of Unity in Gujarat’s Narmada district provides no relief from the pouring rain. As the southwest monsoon intensified across the state Saturday, a video emerged of visitors carefully wading through puddles of water while rainwater leaked from cracks in the ceiling. The State of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is the world’s tallest statue at 182 metres.
The viewing gallery, which can accommodate up to 200 visitors at a time, has been designed in a way to ensure that the public gets a grand view of the Narmada.
The statue is experiencing its first monsoon since its inauguration in October last year and therefore videos of water dripping from the ceiling in the gallery went viral in no time on Saturday morning as the rains intensified overnight.

However, officials of the statue stated that the accumulation of water on the floor of the viewing gallery could not be termed as ‘leakage’.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
IK Patel, CEO of Statue of Unity, told The Indian Express that the gallery had puddles of water as it was open.
“The entire purpose of keeping the viewing gallery open is to allow the people to enjoy the scenic beauty of the place in its natural form. There is a glass enclosure at the back and there is no water collected there. However, the front of the gallery at the chest is open as per the design and it is natural that the rain will come into the standing area. There is no leakage in this part as the water dripping from the ceiling is also just a trail of the same rainwater,” he said.
Patel, however, agreed that the exhibition hall at the base has reported leakage from several parts of the ceiling on Saturday morning.
“We have asked L&T to take corrective action immediately in the exhibition hall. There is no leakage anywhere else,” Patel said, adding that the facade was not meant to be sealed.
“The facade panels are meant to have some gap and not be sealed. It is not due to this that the water is seeping in,” he said.
In 2014, the Gujarat government handed out a contract to a multi-firm consortium to execute the construction. While L&T is the executing firm, the consortium includes Michael Graves Architecture & Design (MGA&D) and Turner Construction, which previously developed the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.
The construction of the actual statue began with the feet after the completion of the raft foundation, using the “jump form” construction assembly with built-in hydraulic lifting jacks that move the structure upwards.
The concrete cores A and B, which house the elevators and the staircase, form the centre of the entire statue, including the feet, and end at the height of the viewing gallery. The entire statue has a steel framework affixed and then cladded with the bronze plates.
The Statue of Unity was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2018. The Rs 2,989 crore project took 42 months, and round-the-clock work by 3,400 labourers and 250 engineers to complete. The foundation stone of the statue was laid in October 2013 by Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at that time. The Statue of Unity beats China’s ‘Spring Temple Buddha’ as the world’s tallest statue.

The inflow was close to 2.2 lakh cusecs, thus raising the level in the dam by nearly two metres overnight and four metres since Saturday.
The level in the dam on Saturday was at 122.67 metres. Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) officials said that the current inflow to the dam is due to the release from the hydropower plants in MP, as well as heavy rain in the catchment area of the Narmada basin.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In August 2019, the dam had reached its full reservoir level of 138.68 metres for the first time since the installation of the 30 gates after raising its height in 2017. However, despite the inflow of the water, the Riverbed Powerhouse (RBPH) is currently turned off.
Earlier in June this year, both the RBPH and the Canal Head Powerhouse (CHPH) had started to produce 17 to 20 million units (MU) of electricity worth Rs 4 crore per day. Officials had said that it was resumed at the request of MP, which has a 57% share in the electricity generation from the Narmada dam as per the Award of the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal.
The powerhouse also functioned in May, but was closed due to the ongoing construction work on the Garudeshwar weir located 12 km downstream of the dam.
The construction of Garudeshwar weir, which will allow authorities to hold the water that is released from the turbines after the generation of power around the Statue of Unity (located 3.5 kilometres downstream), is to be completed by the end of this year.
The SSNNL is also set to operate a jetty service for tourists visiting the Statue of Unity to cruise along the six-kilometre stretch downstream from the statue towards the weir.
Meanwhile, close to 60 villages on the riverbanks of the Mahisagar river have been put on alert after the Kadana Dam in Mahisagar district began releasing 1.5 lakh cusec water through 10 open gates."

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has sought three chimpanzees seized by the Customs Department at Kolkata airport for the zoological park being developed near the Sardar Patel Unity Statue in Kevadia, Gujarat. Earlier scheduled to be inaugurated on October 31, the 350-acre Sardar Patel Zoological Park (SPZP) is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet projects for the statue site.
Rupani’s request to Union Minister of Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar seeking his intervention in getting the three chimpanzees, which are believed to have been illegally smuggled from abroad, follows death of several exotic animals meant for the park in transit.
The three apes have been at the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata for the past two months. The zoo authorities said the chimpanzees were doing well, and they had no information regarding Gujarat’s request.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In his letter, Rupani has said the apes would “generate additional attraction for thousands of tourists who are expected to visit the Jungle Safari”. Central Zoo Authority (CZA) Member Secretary S P Yadav confirmed receiving the letter, adding, “The minister (Javadekar) will respond on behalf of the CZA.”
Managing Director, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited, Rajiv Gupta is also Gujarat’s Additional Chief Secretary (Forests and Environment), and is in the loop on the plan.
The chimpanzees landed in Customs, followed by Enforcement Directorate (ED), custody as part of a money-laundering probe. Alleged wildlife smuggler Supradip Guha is being probed for using fake papers, including a birth certificate for one of the chimpanzees, to show the animals he was transporting as originating in India. He is also facing a case in a local court over possession of prohibited Indian wildlife. The ED seized the chimpanzees, and several marmosets, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The chimpanzees are estimated to be worth nearly Rs 25 lakh each, and a marmoset Rs 1.5 lakh, in the market.
The Gujarat authorities had raced against time to build the SPZP within six months, from the time it was “envisaged by the honorable Prime Minister of India during his visit to Kevadia” in end 2018. It was developed on barren ground that had earlier served as dumping site for the debris excavated to build the Statue of Unity, and greening was done by transplanting fully grown trees.
In its letter, Rupani mentions that Modi had visited the site to review the work. However, the PM could not inaugurate it on the scheduled date of October 31, picked to coincide with the first anniversary of the opening of the statue.
The animals headed for the park which died in transit were being brought from South Africa. While sources told The Indian Express that eight-10 of the animals had died, Gupta said there were two-four deaths. “A few deaths are expected during transit from one country to another.”
Asked whether permission had been taken for the import of the animals from the CZA, Member Secretary Yadav said, “Import is a different issue and is handled by the DGFT (Director General of Foreign Trade).”
Under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, imported animals have to be quarantined for at least 30 days. Till last week, with final touches still being given to the zoo, several of them remained under quarantine, including a giraffe, zebras and impalas. The zoo also has wallabies, emus, Pantagonian mara, ostrich, iguana, marmoset, several species of monkeys, a lion, a Royal Bengal Tiger, leopards, antelopes, Indian wild ass, single-horned rhino and Indian bisons. Its one-acre aviary is one of the largest in the country.
At the Kolkata zoo, the authorities say that the chimpanzees are a hit. “They attract huge crowds,” said a senior ED official. Alipore Zoo Director didn’t respond to phone calls.

The water level in the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam at Kevadiya on Tuesday rose to 133 metres, just five metres short of its upper limit, due to heavy inflow of water from upstream, officials said.
The water level crossed the 133-metre mark on Tuesday in the dam where Full Reservoir Level (FRL) is 138.63 metres, owing to an inflow of 2.9 lakh cusecs of water following rain in catchment areas, as well as water released by Madhya Pradesh, according to Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) officials. Villages along the river bank have been alerted and asked to restrain movement.
“The dam received an inflow of water at the rate of 2.99 lakh cusec (cubic feet per second), out of which 2.18 lakh cusec water has been released by opening 15 out of total 30 gates,” said an official. As of now, the dam, which has the capacity of 4.75 million acre feet (MAF) water, is 81.27 per cent full.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani expressed hope that the dam water level will touch its full reservoir level for the first time since 2017 when its height was raised. “The full reservoir level of the dam is 138 (.68) metres. For the first time since the work on raising its height was completed (in 2017), the dam will be full to the brim,” the CM told reporters on the sidelines of an event.
“In a true sense, the water of the dam, which is Gujarat’s lifeline, will contribute greatly to the development of the state,” he said.
The water gushing downstream meant that the Gora bridge, 8 kilometres from the dam, across the river was submerged and closed to traffic. About 10 villages in Narmada district along the river course were left without an access road, while tourists from Rajpipla visiting Kevadia and the Statue of Unity have been directed to travel via Garudeshwar.
The outflow into the main canal is 7,270 cusecs. Additionally, the release to Rajasthan was recorded at 553 cusecs on Tuesday. The Sardar Sarovar basin has received 1,172.8 mm of rainfall since June 15. The Riverbed Powerhouse (RBPH), which was turned on after two years in early August, and the Canalhead Powerhouse (CHPH) are generating a combined power of about 27 MU ( Million Units) every day.
According to officials, 204 dams in the state are filled to the extent of 70.72 per cent of their total storage capacity. “Of the 204 dams, 41 are full to the brim while 40 dams are 70-100 per cent full. Another 22 dams are 50-70 per cent full while the current water stock in 36 others is 25-50 per cent,” they said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(File)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday will dedicate to the nation the Sardar Sarovar Dam on river Narmada, described as Gujarat’s lifeline by BJP leaders, at an event coinciding with his 67th birthday. The foundation stone of the dam was laid on April 5, 1961 by the country’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. However, it took 56 years to complete its construction. Modi will arrive in Ahmedabad tonight, and seek blessings of his mother Hiraba tomorrow morning. His visit, which has added significance as the Assembly elections are due in Gujarat by year-end, is the second in less than a week after he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe here and launched the Bullet train project.
“Tomorrow Sardar Sarovar Dam will be dedicated to the nation. This project will benefit lakhs of farmers and help fulfil people’s aspirations,” Modi tweeted today. Earlier, Modi had stressed that the project will start a new chapter of prosperity for Gujarat. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had called the project as “Gujarat’s lifeline” noting that the agriculture income and production of farmers in the state more than doubled because of it.
The event will take place at Kevadia in Narmada district. The delay in the completion of the dam was due to numerous reasons. Medha Patkar-led Narmada Bachao Andolan took the government to the Supreme Court over environmental and rehabilitation issues, and obtained a stay in 1996. The court allowed resumption of work in October 2000. The height of the dam was recently raised to 138.68 metres, which will allow maximum ‘usable storage’ of 4.73 million acre feet of water. “The Congress committed the sin of obstructing the project at every step. Within 20 days of becoming prime minister, Modi gave final approval to raise the height of the dam,” Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya said here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After the inauguration at the dam site at Kevadia, Modi will go to Sadhu Bet, an island in the Narmada river where a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called ‘Statue of Unity’, and a memorial complex dedicated to the country’s first home minister are coming up. Thereafter, the PM will attend the closing ceremony of ‘Narmada Mahotsav’, and address a gathering at Dabhoi. He will also lay the foundation stone for National Tribal Freedom Fighters’ Museum during the event. Modi will then visit Amreli in Saurashtra where he will attend a host of programmes and address a public gathering.
“Looking forward to addressing a gathering of cooperatives, Sahakar Samemelan in Amreli tomorrow,” the PM tweeted. Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has claimed that the project is not complete and canals of 43,000 km length were yet to be built despite the BJP ruling the state for 22 years."

Four days after a Vadodara family went missing post their visit to the Statue of Unity, four of the five members were found dead on Thursday afternoon.
Their car was pulled out from a canal near Dabhoi by the the fire and emergency department, and search is on to locate the fifth family member.
On Thursday, the car was spotted by local residents. The bodies of Kalpesh Parmar, his mother Usha, and children Niyati and Atharva were found inside. However, Parmar’s wife Trupti is yet to be traced.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The family went missing under mysterious circumstances after visiting the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district. They were captured in a CCTV camera outside the Children’s Nutrition park on the evening of March 1 (Sunday). Police officers on Wednesday said the family was last spotted at Krishna Kathiyawadi hotel CCTV in Dabhoi, about 35 kilometers from Vadodara, after which their phones went untraceable.
According to the police, prima facie, Parmar lost control of the car, which fell into the canal at night. However, investigations are on before the case is concluded as an accident, officers said.
In their last conversation with their family, Kalpesh had informed his cousin that they were planning to meet a relative in Bharuch before returning to Vadodara. On Monday morning, when Kalpesh’s grandfather tried to contact him, his phone was switched off. He then called up their relative in Bharuch, who said Kalpesh never reached their place.
Kalpesh’s family members then reached Kevadia Colony and informed the police."

Taking a dig at the alliance forged by the Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Paatil challenged BTP supremo and MLA from Jhagadia in Bharuch, Chhotu Vasava, to retain his assembly seat in the 2022 Assembly polls.
Without naming AIMIM chief Owaisi or his party, Paatil said, “The BJP works and earns the hearts of the people through their votes. In your area (Rajpipla), someone has turned up from Hyderabad… have you heard of him? The BJP had taught them a lesson in the Municipal Corporation elections of Hyderabad… Gujarat is a land of intellectuals. It is a land where the citizens understand what is best for their own interest.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
At the event, two prominent Congress members from the district Nikunj Patel and Manoj Tadvi joined the BJP. Launched a scathing attack at Chhotu Vasava,Paatil said, “The BTP has been exploiting the people for several years. Now the Hyderabad people have joined them… But we defeat them together and send them home. In the upcoming Assembly election, even Chhotubhai (Vasava) will go home…”

The BJP, which could not establish control over the taluka panchayats in Nandod, Dediapada and Sagbara as well as the district panchayat of Narmada in the 2015 polls, has a lot at stake as the district of Narmada is on the tourism map with the coming up of the Statue of Unity in Kevadia in Garudeshwar Taluka — the only taluka panchayat that the BJP won in 2015. 
“People who held power so far never worked for development. It has left the voters in a state of confusion and distrust. They have been betrayed… But if you join with the BJP, you will elect an honest party and strengthen it to work for the tribal rights…,” Paatil said.
Speaking of the “opportunity” that the BJP is offering the tribal community by building the SoU, Paatil said, “If you allow the Congress or the BTP to take power here, they will do what Rajiv Gandhi once said, ‘When I send Re 1, only 25 paise reaches the actual person it is meant for’. If you feel that this fund should reach you, for your future and the future of your children, you will have to bid them a goodbye and choose BJP…”
 
Paatil added that the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a “lot in store” for Narmada district. “Narenda Modi decided to build the Statue of Unity… He chose this land, where no birds came calling– today there is a seaplane, railway line, four lane highways…,” he said."

This is the second time since its inauguration on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the seaplane service has been suspended for maintenance. The first “routine maintenance” of the aircraft was carried out three days after its inauguration when the services were suspended for two days.
Captain Ajay Chauhan, the Director of Civil Aviation, Government of Gujarat, told The Sunday Express the seaplane had to be sent to the Maldives as it is registered in that country and because India does not yet have a hangar facility for maintenance of seaplanes.
“The seaplane has to mandatorily undergo maintenance at various levels, depending on its flying hours and distance covered. This is a major maintenance and occurs after every stipulated flying hours.

Shifting the burden of proof of a lawful religious conversion from the converted to his/her partner; different jail terms depending on gender; legitimising the intrusion of the state and third parties in the choice of who an individual wishes to marry—the new Uttar Pradesh “love jihad law” raises several questions of Constitutional propriety.
“If we do not allow the younger generation to express, how will they know that what they are expressing is right or wrong.” This observation was made by the Bombay High Court while hearing a plea filed by a 38-year-old woman who was booked for allegedly making offensive remarks on social media against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya Thackeray.

Despite the Maharashtra government making it compulsory for travellers arriving from Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat to undergo Covid testing, thousands of them are slipping away everyday without being tested at the Mumbai airport. Low airport staff to manage the rush, testing kiosks set up close to the baggage collection belts are among the reasons being cited for the poor screening.
In Goa, the first election promise for the 2022 polls has been made: “imposition of compulsory siesta hour”. Goa Forward Party leader and BJP ally Vijai Sardesai has said that the need to preserve “sussegad” — that typically Goan characteristic that lies somewhere between being laid back and indolent — is tied to the fight against bigger changes sweeping across the state.

The product placement on the cash counter of Kanu Tadvi’s roadside convenience kiosk shows his business acumen. Arranged neatly, under the usual retail-outlet door hangings of flavoured chips, are used one-litre ‘Bisleris’ refilled with petrol.
Bottled fuel is one of Tadvi’s best-selling items. Most of his customers, almost everyone from Gora village’s 80 houses, invariably give in to the impulse to buy this extremely essential commodity. As Tadvi pours petrol into the empty tank of a self-start gearless two-wheeler owned by a regular, he checks how far the latter needs to go. “Just about 2 km down the road,” says the helmet-less driver. That’s where most of Gora heads these days.
Tadvi likes to talk to his clients. His second question is slightly cryptic, at least to outsiders. “How far has it reached?” he asks. The man points to his knees and looks around, before he spots a mini-truck parked by the road. “The toe nails are as big as that truck,” he says.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Eyes widen, jaw drops. Thankfully, Tadvi recovers fast to share his surprise. “Sardar nu putdo (Sardar’s statue)… Statue of Unity,” he drops the 600-feet hint. A less-shocked and more informed bystander, a young Goraite, fishes out a smartphone. He volunteers to show a WhatsApp forward, of a picture of a massive bronze head of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel tied to a fork-lift. Not many believe it’s real; they say it’s too small a bust for “the world’s tallest sculpture” — a showpiece project of the BJP governments in the state and the Centre.
Gora is good with measurements. They know their milimetres, metres and kilometres pretty well here in this hamlet of the Narmada district of south Gujarat. They need to. They also have a fear of heights, and distances as well. It’s in their DNA. For generations, their life has revolved around the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam on “Ma Rewa (as they call the Narmada)” and the acres they have lost because of that. Of late, the narrative has changed. These days the dream is 600-ft tall.
As more villagers flock around the rundown shed, that sells everything from vegetables and cooking oil to spices — and if you wish, all put together in a meal and served at a smaller dilapidated hut next door — Gora’s several kilometres’ long complaint list rolls out.
The nearest petrol pump from the dam/statue site/Gora is about 12 km at Garudeshwar; closest school after Class VII a further kilometre away still. A well-equipped government hospital is at Rajpipla, all of 25 km away, and the same is true for a cinema hall. “Miscalculating distances or the mileage of your vehicle can mean the difference between life and death,” says Raipal, who spent his youth in Gora but is now stationed at Rajpipla, where he is an educator. Politicians don’t quite inspire confidence among the locals.

BJP’s Shabdsharnbhai Tadvi is the sitting MLA, with Gora falling in Nandod constituency. The villagers say they haven’t seen him in a while. Meanwhile, as our Tadvi replaces the bottled fuel on the cash counter, you know that Gora’s Biyani knows his retail.
The 41-year-old wasn’t always into selling kirana items. For years, the Tadvis, listed as a Scheduled Tribe, were farmers. Like the Vasavas, Tadvis call themselves indigenous people, the original inhabitants of the plains next to the Narmada. They grew jowar, gram, cotton and vegetables. Land was fertile, life wasn’t complicated. “In 1961-62, the Sardar Sarovar project started and the government asked my grandfather to give his land. We had 16 acres, and we got Rs 36,000 for it,” says Tadvi.
This patch of family holding, like 20 other separate land masses belonging to different Gora families, wasn’t to be submerged by gated water. It was for storing the sea of building material wheeled in for dam construction. “We were told once the project got over, we would get our land back,” says Tadvi, who was given a job at the site as an added incentive. “With no land, I worked at the site after completing Class 10. My education was wasted though since I was a labourer there doing manual job.”

After 25 years of work, his last salary was Rs 3,000. Cut to 2017. The dam project is over, the steel rods and cement bags are no longer stacked on land, and the godowns that once held them are empty. The 20 families now want their land — a total of 105.66 hectares, as mentioned in last month’s Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited’s land-for-land demand to Kevadia Colony collector — back.
“The work was over long back. Now they are saying take Rs 5 lakh and let us keep the land. We want land, not money,” says Tadvi. He fears that his land will now be used to beautify the surrounding of the Giant Sardar so that it can be promoted as an international tourist destination.
Wouldn’t he benefit if Gora gets a piece of the tourist trade, with his strategically placed “24X7”, “ask for anything” shop? Wouldn’t he make a killing with his first-mover advantage? Tadvi isn’t even listening. He is someone whose ears have become deaf to promises; he has been sold dreams before. “You see that handpump… That’s where I get my water from,” he says. There is a collective shake of heads around. Everyone around gets the sarcasm of the man who spent 25 years building a dam.
“Do you think my shop will survive once this becomes a tourist place?” Tadvi adds. It’s the cynicism of a defeated man who doesn’t have it in him anymore to put up a fight. “I went with Medha Patkar to the Supreme Court three times. Remember Deve Gowda (the former prime minister), we were taken to him. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Those whose lands were submerged by water were better. At least they were compensated,” laments the tiny man with a booming voice.
He points a finger to the horizon ahead, where his land lies. “Since it’s empty now, we farm it. There’s an empty godown on my patch, we house our livestock there. Around it I have grown vegetables and tuvar. But with the land not in my name, I don’t have kisan card, crop insurance and I can’t get loan on it,” Tadvi’s voice trails off as he gets distracted by a man who is dragging his scooter to his shop.
But as he picks up another bottle from the counter, he smiles. It’s the smile of a self-made man, an enterprising Gujarati, whose vikas has been subject of many debates this election and whose identity stolen by actors in promotional videos."

Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Rajpipla issued the order banishing Musafir, who was served a notice for proceedings of externment in March this year, under section 56(A), Gujarat Police Act 1951. He has been accused of “inciting locals against government, trading in liquor and being part of anti-social groups”.
The order by Rajpipla SDM, KD Bhagat, has relied on two FIRs registered against him in 2019 for rioting, unlawful assembly, causing hurt to public servants and criminal intimidation and also accused Musafir of being involved in illicit liquor trade although no complaint has been registered against him under the Prohibition Act so far.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The order, dated September 14, states, “In view of the application submitted by the Superintendent of Police of Narmada District, the accussed Lakhan Musafir is a dubious person. I know that he does not have any honest means of livelihood and along with his accomplices, is continuously inciting local villagers in Kevadia around the Statue of Unity as well as the Narmada dam. Along with many anti-social elements, Musafir is known to organise public gatherings to mislead the people into anti government activities.”

The SDM further said that Musafir is known for “anti-government slogans” and interrupting government works to breach law and order. It states, “…In several incidents in the past he and his accomplices, have indulged in fights with government officials as well as officers of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam limited (SSNNL) and broken the peace and law in the area.”
The order further accuses Musafir or “targetting” the SoU, which has earned Kevadia much repute and says that no villager is willing to stand witness against Musafir due to the “fear” he has instilled among people.
It says, “Time and again, he has targeted the Statue of Unity located inKevadia by gathering his group of anti-social elements as well as people from the villages close by to indulge in anti-government activity…”
The two FIRs against Musafir in Kevadia police station date back to January and October 2019. In January 2019, Musafir was accused of leading a mob that resorted to rioting at the ground breaking ceremony of the Haryana Bhavan near SOU at the hands of Haryana Chief Minister ManoharLal Khattar. The matter is pending in court.
The second case registered against Musafir is of October 31, 2019 — the day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kevadia to inaugurate peripheral tourist spots around SoU. Musafir, who has now taken shelter in Mandvi taluka of Surat district, told The Indian Express,
“They booked me in the two cases by design because they were planning to outlaw me since over seven years, ever since I joined villagers protesting against the Garudeshwar Weir and then the Statue of Unity. They had no cases to outlaw me. I am a simple man who has been involved in agriculture and to make villagers self-sufficient.”

The SDM’s order adds that a “private inquiry” conducted by him revealed that Musafir was known to assault people “as well as have them assaulted by his group of anti-social elements”. Although the initial hearing on the notice of externment was scheduled for March 24 this year, it was shifted to July due to Covid-19 lockdown.
In his reply to the notice of July 13, Musafir called himself a “Gandhian” and denied allegations of inciting villagers or being involved in bootlegging. He said, “The charges levelled against me are false… I am involved in activities related to Gandhian principles… Taking people’s genuine complaints to the government can never be called a crime.”
Musafir has also cited recommendations about him from from former Gujarat Chief Ministers Sureshchandra Mehta and Amarsinh Chaudhary as well as five other friends. However, the SDM said that two cases registered against Musafir is evidence enough.
Musafir said, “The Kevadia police accompanied me to Mandvi, after confirming from me where I would be staying for six months. I have to report to the Mandvi police station every 15 days.”
“The Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Act, 2019 has been executed. PM Modi will inaugurate the seaplane service next month. They do not want anyone around who support local protests. The fact is that the protests are being organised by the locals because they are aware of their rights… The government failed to address the issues of the local people related to land acquisition and submergence of villages due to the Garudeshwar Weir. People are agitated. There are many other projects planned in the area that will take away the essential tribal identity of the people along with their lands,” he says.
Musafir, originally from Bhavnagar, says he moved to Mathavadi village in Kevadia. “I moved to this place in 1986 when villagers were agitating against land acquisition for the Narmada Dam. I did not directly join the agitation but I have been a sympathiser of anyone who loses their land, in any part of the state. My interest lies in farming and I taught many villagers techniques for organic farming, selflessly. The aim was to make them self reliant. Over the years, I have imbibed the tribal way of life myself,” says Musafir, adding that he is not affiliated to any political party.
Kevadia had seen clashes between villagers and officials of SSNNL and police in May and June this year when the SSNNL took possession of and fenced lands acquired in 1961 after the Gujarat High Court dismissed a petition filed by six affected villages around the Statue of Unity."

MORE THAN four months since commencing work on the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial Project in the Arabian Sea, the state PWD is now re-assessing the stance of the statue, considering whether the warrior king should be depicted in the originally proposed equestrian stance or if it should be a standing statue like the Sardar Patel Statue of Unity in Gujarat.
Documents obtained by The Indian Express under the Right to Information Act reveal that the “stance” of the statue was discussed at a meeting of the project’s technical committee on November 27, 2018.
“The stance of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue is not yet finalised. In this regard, the chairman (of the committee) directed the project management consultant to submit small replicas of three-four alternative (positions),” read the minutes of the meeting of the technical committee. The principal secretary of the PWD is the chairman of the technical committee.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The meeting was held in November 2018, over a month after the PWD instructed the project contractor to start work. Currently, work is stalled after the PWD last month asked the contractor to stop work days after the Supreme Court, while hearing a special leave petition, orally asked the state not to proceed with the construction activity on the statue.
Sources said that after the November meeting, four models of the statue in different stances were presented to senior PWD officials. One of these depicts a standing Shivaji statue, similar to the Shivaji statue at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai. “After the inauguration of Sardar Patel’s statue, many people appeared to appreciate it. That may have influenced the government to consider the option of a standing statue of Shivaji,” said a source. The three other models show the warrior king riding a horse, but with minor differences in the angle of the horse’s legs.
Principal Secretary (PWD) Manoj Saunik refused to comment on the fresh re-assessment of design.
An official said the height of the statue may also be increased if the state government opts for a standing statue, in order to outdo the 182-metre tall Sardar Patel Statue of Unity.
However, the PWD’s move to reconsider the basic stance and design of the statue at this stage has met with surprise. “Tenders for the project were floated with a concept design of an equestrian statue with two legs of the horse raised. Even the contract agreement for the project has been signed with contractor in June 2018 and the orders to commence the work has also been given to the contractor. Everyone was of the opinion that the stance of the equestrian statue was final,” said a government official.
In December 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had carried out ‘jal poojan’ for the Rs 3,700-crore project, the concept was of an equestrian statue. In addition, all permissions received from 12 agencies, including the Ministry of Environment, refer to an equestrian statue.
While the officials are tight lipped about what prompted them to re-assess the stance of the statue, one section of PW officials believe the change is being considered on account of the challenges involved in building the originally proposed equestrian statue.Mumbai NewsMaha: Woman drowns self after husband dies of COVID; 3 year-old son follows suitBMC standing committee to meet virtually on Friday as HC disposes PIL seeking physical meetingMumbai: Man, kin get anticipatory bail in domestic violence caseClick here for more
The Shivaji memorial as proposed — 210 m in height, including a 121.2-m equestrian statue standing atop an 88.8-m pedestal — is a flagship project of the BJP-led government in the state."

The seaplane operations, which have been suspended since November 28, will resume on December 28, it said.
SpiceJet officials said the aircraft being brought in will be newer and “about a decade-old”. The bookings for the Ahmedabad-Kevadia seaplane route have commenced from December 28, they added.

The aircraft — 8Q ISC — which was brought in on October 25 for the inaugural run of India’s first-ever seaplane service, was a 49-year-old aircraft and had maintenance needs that could not be met in India due to its foreign registration and an absence of water hangar in the country. The aircraft had undergone a two-day maintenance activity on the third day after its inauguration.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Officials said the government had conveyed to the SpiceJet, which is operating the seaplane under the subsidiary SpiceShuttle, the company must fetch a “younger” aircraft that is not “fatigued” to ensure longevity.
SpiceJet has a wet-lease with Maldivian Aero, which is responsible for the operations, maintenance, insurance and crew of the aircraft. The aircraft, brought in for the inaugural run, has received much criticism for being “old”.
“The government has expressed its view that a younger aircraft would be more suitable for the operations as the increase in the number of daily trips is on cards, along with a second phase of the water aerodrome operations between Ahmedabad and Palitana. The older aircraft was fit to fly but it is true that it wouldn’t have the same longevity as a new aircraft,” a SpiceJet official said.
On Wednesday, Captain Ajay Chauhan, the director of GUJSAIL, told The Indian Express that SpiceJet was to bring in a “similar aircraft” on December 27. “The operations will resume on December 28 once the aircraft is here. There has been a delay because a cyclonic storm was building up in the Indian Ocean and the weather conditions were not suitable for the aircraft to fly. A similar Twin Otter 300-series aircraft will be coming in as a replacement for the first aircraft that operated for a month,” Chauhan said.
Incidentally, in an application seeking information under the Right to Information Act, 2005, Ahmedabad-based social activist Vishwas Bhambhurkar in November had requested the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to provide authenticated photocopies of “all permissions sought and received regarding the operation” of the seaplane service between Ahmedabad and Kevadia.
In its reply, the DGCA said the SpiceJet Technic Private Limited had made an application on October 28 seeking authorisation to use water aerodrome sites at Sabarmati Riverfront, Ahmedabad and Statue of Unity at Kevadia, starting October 30 — it was inaugurated on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The communication noted that in view of “satisfactory compliance of minimum safety requirements at both water aerodrome sites” as laid down in Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) provisions, SpiceJet “is authorised to use” both aerodromes for passenger charter operation with the Twin Otter aircraft with effect from October 30 for a period of one month, as a provisional permit. The authorisation was granted on October 29, a day after SpiceJet’s application.
Under Section 3 Series F Part I of the appropriate civil aviation provisions, the DGCA can recommend to the Ministry of Civil Aviation to grant special permission for operation and retention of a foreign-registered aircraft in India beyond a period of 15 days, up to 60 days, on a case-to-case basis. A case can be made if the state government, in turn, recommends so to the DGCA owing to “official commitments”.

Chauhan said, “The interim provisional permit is a regular process. SpiceJet has already applied for permission for the new aircraft that will come in by the end of this week. The general procedure is to grant permission after the aircraft is inspected and assessed once it lands in India. The new aircraft will also receive the permissions as needed and they can be extended on application.”
The pre-feasibility report submitted by the Civil Aviation Department of that state government for the development of Sabarmati Riverfront Water Aerodrome estimated: “The floating population (passengers) of 380 is envisaged per day. The annual projection is about 1,02,600 passengers per annum during assumed 270 non-monsoon days.”"

THE SP-BSP-RLD alliance chose BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha’s wife and former actress Poonam Sinha to take on senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh from this BJP bastion.
But going into polling on May 6, it is clear that this seat, once represented by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, still bears the large shadow cast by him.
The Congress candidate is self-styled spiritual guru Pramod Krishnam. He was a surprise choice given that in 2014, fielded by the party from Sambhal Lok Sabha seat, he had won only 1.52% of the votes.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Last week, among those trying to invoke Vajpayee’s legacy was Krishnam, who promised to build a grand statue of Vajpayee in Lucknow on the lines of the Statue of Unity for Sardar Patel in Gujarat.
During the 2014 election campaign, Rajnath Singh, who served as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh between October 2000 and March 2002, had claimed that Vajpayee had gifted him an angvastram (stole) when he filed his nomination. Campaigning for his Congress rival Rita Bahuguna Joshi was Vajpayee’s niece Karuna Shukla. However, Rajnath had handsomely defeated Joshi, winning by over 2.72 lakh votes. In 2016, Joshi quit the Congress to join the BJP.
With its sizeable Muslim population — around 13% of the residents of the city are Muslim — the community is witnessing effort by all parties to woo it. Among them even Rajnath Singh.
On Tuesday, the Union minister met with Muslim clerics, including Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali. Rasheed, however, told The Indian Express that the meeting was “non-political and there was no discussion about the elections”.
Earlier this week, gathbandhan candidate Poonam Sinha held public meetings in Aminabad, an area with a large Muslim population. An SP leader told The Indian Express that the party “is hoping that the entire Muslim population would vote for the SP-BSP alliance and is working hard to consolidate the votes”.
Sinha said that she has been meeting Muslim leaders and will continue to hold such meetings in the coming days. “We are meeting Muslim clerics because we feel they are important. We need their blessings,” she said.
Asked how the caste arithmetic would play out following the alliance between the SP and BSP, Sinha said, “The alliance will work in my favour. The BSP’s votes will be transferred to us and we will win Lucknow.” She added, “The euphoria then (in 2014) was different than it is this time. They (the BJP) have wasted the last five years. People want change now.”
Owais Gaffar (42), a shopkeeper in the Muslim-dominated Chowk, is not sure if their votes matter. Saying Rajnath Singh will win irrespective of who they vote for, he added, “They (the BJP) have won the seat for as long as I can remember. He will be supported by some Shias too in Old Lucknow. He is a good, secular leader, unlike some others in his party.”
A sugarcane juice seller in Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar area, Siddhartha (28), who belongs to the Jatav caste (Scheduled Caste) and claims to be a traditional BJP voter, says people in Lucknow have no choice but to vote for the BJP. “Now that Rajnathji is contesting, we have to vote for him. We would have liked to see a strong candidate from the vipaksh (Opposition). But they have fielded kamzor (weak) candidates,” Siddhartha says as people in his shop, who have stopped for a drink, nod."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday visited the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat to mark his 69th birthday. Addressing a public rally in Kevadiya, Modi spoke on the Statue of Unity, the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and the Sardar Sarovar Dam.
Sardar Patel and the Statue of Unity
The Prime Minister lauded the vision of Sardar Patel, adding the BJP-led government’s decision last month on Jammu and Kashmir was an inspiration from the former home minister of India.
The abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and the decision to bifurcate the state into two union territories are inspired by Sardar Patel and are an attempt to find solution to a decades-old problem, Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The PM said the Hyderabad Liberation Day is a result of Sardar Patel’s vision. Observed on September 17 each year, it marks the day in 1948 when the erstwhile Hyderabad State was annexed to the Indian Union.
Modi said he was happy to see the rising number of visitors to the Statue of Unity. While the 133-year-old State of Liberty gets around 10,000 visitors per day, about 8,500 people visit the 11-month-old Statue of Unity daily, he said.
The Sardar Sarovar project is catering to needs of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and has benefited people in these four states, he further said.
On Kashmir
On his visit to his home state, Modi said he was confident of bringing prosperity and trust to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh “with the active support of millions of colleagues.”
On BJP’s 100 days at Centre
The Prime Minister also spoke on the BJP-led NDA government’s  100 days in its second consecutive term.
“Your servant is fully committed to the unity and superiority of India. We have strengthened this commitment over the last 100 days,” he said, adding that the new government “will work faster than before, will achieve bigger goals than before.”
PM celebrates birthday in Gujarat
Earlier today, Modi offered prayers to goddess Narmada at the Sardar Sarovar dam. Accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Modi offered prayers as part of the state government’s Namami Devi Narmade Mahotsav celebrations being held to mark the dam receiving water to its full capacity.
Modi also visited the Butterfly Garden in Kevadiya and named the saffron coloured plain tiger butterfly as the state butterfly.
He later paid a visit to the Statue of Unity and the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada. The Statue of Unity, billed as the tallest in the world, was inaugurated by him on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 last year.
He also tweeted a video of the statue, taken from his helicopter. Modi arrived at Kevadiya on Tuesday morning to take part in the ‘Namami Narmada’ festival being celebrated by the Gujarat government to mark the filling up of the dam to its full reservoir level of 138.68 metres.
For the first time since the height of the dam was raised in 2017, the water level reached its highest peak at 138.68 metres on Sunday evening. Modi along with Rupani, then performed ‘puja’ at the dam site to ‘welcome’ the water of river Narmada, the lifeline of Gujarat.

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)
President Ram Nath Kovind Friday hailed the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as “historic”, but sidestepped references to NRC, while addressing the joint session of both houses of Parliament sparking protests from the opposition. “The Citizenship Amendment Act is a historic law. It has fulfilled wishes of our founding fathers including Mahatma Gandhi,” he said. He also said that debate and discussion on any issue strengthen democracy while violence during protests weaken it.
However, his omission of reference to the NRC holds significance in wake of the fact that President had announced Modi government’s decision to “implement the process of ‘National Register of Citizens’ on priority basis” in his address to the joint sitting at the inauguration of 17th Lok Sabha on June 20 last year.

Here is the full text of President’s address in the Parliament today:
Honourable Members,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
1. I am pleased to address the joint sitting of Parliament at the start of the third decade of 21st century. I once again extend my best wishes for the New Year and congratulate all Members of Parliament for being a witness to this historic occasion.
2. This decade is extremely important for India. In this decade, we will complete 75 years of our independence. In this decade, we all have to work together with new energy to give impetus to the making of a new India. With the efforts of my Government, a strong foundation has been laid in the last five years, to make this decade India’s decade and this century India’s century.
3. Whether it is Pujya Bapu’s dream of Gram Swaraj, Babasaheb Ambedkar’s principle of social justice, Nehru ji’s dream of creating a modern India, Sardar Patel’s resolve for Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s goal of Antyodaya, Lohia ji’s vision of social equality, we the people of India will together make these dreams a reality.
Honourable Members,
4. The Constitution of India is the guiding light for all of us in fulfilling these dreams. Just a few weeks ago, on 26th November, 70 years of the Constitution have been completed. On that day, 12 crore citizens of the country, publicly read out the Preamble of the Constitution and renewed their commitment to the Constitution.

5. In addition, to protecting the rights of every citizen of our country, our Constitution makes the citizens of the country mindful of their duties. Further, our Constitution also places an expectation that the decisions taken through democratic processes will be accepted by the countrymen. At the same time, our Constitution expects the Parliament and every member present in this House to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the countrymen and make the necessary laws, keeping the national interest paramount.
Honourable Members,
6. I am happy that in the last 7 months, Parliament has set new standards in conducting its business. The performance during the first session of this Lok Sabha has set a new record in the last seven decades.
7. Due to my Government’s strong commitment, the law against Triple Talaq ensuring justice to Muslim women and safeguarding their rights; the Consumer Protection Act providing new rights to the citizens; the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act for protecting the savings of the poor; the Chit Funds Amendment Act protecting the poor from fraudulent chit fund schemes; the law enhancing punishment for sexual offences against children; Motor Vehicles Amendment Act aimed at reducing road accidents; and the law protecting the rights of the transgender persons – several such historic legislations have been enacted.
8. I congratulate every Member of Parliament for fulfilling this Constitutional responsibility.
Honourable Members,
9. The faith reposed by the people of our country in our democratic institutions strengthens the foundation of our democracy. The maturity displayed by the countrymen after the Supreme Court’s verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi is also laudable. My Government is of the firm view that mutual discussions and debates strengthen democracy. At the same time, any kind of violence in the name of protests weakens the society and the nation.
Honourable Members,
10. In a democracy, nothing is more sacred than the mandate given by the people. The people of the country have given this mandate to my Government for the making of a new India.
A new India which takes pride in the glory of our ancient culture and which enriches the 21st century world with the power of its knowledge.
A new India, in which besides finding solutions to old problems, new chapters of development are written.
A new India, in which adequate facilities and new opportunities for growth are available for the poor, dalits, women, youth, tribals and minorities.

A new India, where every region develops, no region is left behind, where the benefits of modern technology reach the farthest end of society, and a new India, which is at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution and which attains new heights at the global stage.
Honourable Members,
11. For making such a new India and for fulfilling the expectations of the people, my Government is working with commendable pace and decisiveness to bring about changes in every field. It is the outcome of reforms at the grass-root level ushered in by the Government in the last five years that there has been an unprecedented improvement in India’s global ranking in several areas.
12. In the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, India has leapfrogged to the 63rd position, moving up by 79 places. In the Resolving Insolvency rankings, India has moved from 108th to 52nd position and in the Global Innovation rankings, from 74th to 52nd position. India has improved its international ranking by 10 points in the Logistics Performance Index. India has moved from 52nd to 34th position in the World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness rankings.
13. These reforms in diverse areas are also a call to the international community to see how India has strengthened its foundations in the last 5-6 years and how keen the people of India are to build a new India.
Honourable Members,
14. My Government is following the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, and is working with full commitment and sincerity. Free gas connections to 8 crore poor, houses to 2 crore poor, bank accounts to about 38 crore poor, free treatment facility of up to Rs 5 lakh to 50 crore people, insurance cover to 24 crore people and free electricity connections to over 2.5 crore people have been provided; with complete transparency and without any discrimination. My Government has provided equitable access to benefits and facilities of its schemes for the poor people; of all religions and all regions, and has, thus, earned the trust of the people of the country.
Honourable Members,
15. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the great son of Bengal and the Minister of Industry in the Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru Ji, had said in the Lok Sabha: “In a democratic federal state, the fundamental rights of the citizens of one constituent unit cannot vary vis-à-vis the citizens of another unit. Are not the people of Jammu and Kashmir entitled to the fundamental rights that we have given to the people of India minus Jammu and Kashmir?”
16. Today, after seven decades, the whole country is happy that the dream of crores of freedom fighters including Dr. Mukherjee has come true and the people of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, the Dalits and women from that area have also got the same rights as the people in the rest of the country. The abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution by two-thirds majority in both the Houses of Parliament is not only historic but has also paved the way for equitable development of Jammu – Kashmir, and Ladakh. Through this House, I heartily congratulate the people of Jammu – Kashmir, and Ladakh for joining the mainstream of development.
Honourable Members,
17. Rapid development of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, preservation of their culture and traditions, transparent and honest administration and democratic empowerment are among the priorities of my Government. During the President’s Rule and since becoming a Union Territory, all the developmental projects in Jammu – Kashmir, and Ladakh have gained momentum.
18. Towards the end of the year 2018, elections in more than 4,400 panchayats of Jammu -Kashmir were conducted in a peaceful manner. For the first time since independence, elections to more than 300 Block Development Councils have also been held there. The people there are now getting full benefits under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Yojana, Ujala Yojana, DBT and food subsidy, in a transparent manner. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, while around 3,500 houses were built in Jammu – Kashmir till March 2018, in less than two years thereafter, construction of more than 24,000 houses has been completed.
19. Apart from this, works relating to connectivity, irrigation, hospitals, schemes related to tourism and establishment of institutes of higher education such as IIT, IIM, AIIMS are also proceeding at a rapid pace in Jammu -Kashmir, and Ladakh. NAFED has been entrusted with the responsibility for the direct procurement of apples in Jammu – Kashmir. This has especially benefited the apple growers of Kashmir Valley.
Honourable Members,
20. The success of the public welfare schemes of my Government and the historic decisions taken by the Government have increased the expectations of the countrymen, as well as the responsibilities of the Government.

21. For many years, the people of the country desired that they should be able to pay their respects at Kartarpur Sahib with ease. My Government has built the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in record time and dedicated it to the nation on the occasion of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is a privilege for my Government to have got the opportunity to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji with full veneration, within the country and abroad. The 400th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji will also be celebrated in a befitting manner with full grandeur and devotion by my Government.
Honourable Members,
22. Over 40 lakh people living in the capital city of Delhi, had been living for many years in the hope that one day they would get the ownership rights of their homes and that they will be able to lead a dignified life. The Government has fulfilled this long-awaited expectation of people living in more than 1,700 colonies of Delhi.
23. Farmers, agricultural labourers, unorganized sector labourers and small traders of the country had expectations of a pension scheme that would be of help to them in their old age. My Government has not only fulfilled their wish but also has covered about 60 lakh beneficiaries so far, under these pension schemes.
24. Pujya Bapu always considered cleanliness next to Godliness. On the occasion of Gandhi ji’s 150th birth anniversary, on 2 October last year, rural areas of the country have paid a befitting tribute to the Father of the Nation by declaring themselves free from open defecation. Now it is incumbent on all of us to make our cities and villages even more clean and beautiful in the coming decade.
Honourable Members,
25. Even today, there are about 15 crore houses without piped water supply in rural areas of the country. Our sisters and daughters face the maximum hardship due to lack of water supply in the house. Further, contaminated water adversely impacts the health of the entire family. In order to ensure the availability of sufficient quantity of potable drinking water to each rural household in the country, my Government has launched the Jal Jeevan Mission. Central Government, all State Governments, local bodies, and voluntary organizations are working together to transform this Mission into a people’s movement. In the coming days Rs 3 lakh 60 thousand crore will be spent on this scheme. My Government has launched the Atal Bhujal Yojana with special focus on seven of the most vulnerable states of the country, where groundwater level is depleting rapidly.
Honourable Members,
26. My Government’s mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas is meant for every citizen and for every region and every State of the country. My Government believes that just as advancement of a person on the margins of society should be given high priority, the development of the areas left behind should also receive greater attention.
27. By according 112 districts the status of Aspirational Districts, the Government is paying special attention to each scheme relating to development of the poor living there. State Governments have also positioned the right mix of experienced and youthful officers in these districts. As a result, there has been impressive improvement in several development indicators in these districts and many districts have now come close to their State average. I congratulate and convey my best wishes to the team of each Aspirational District through this House.
Honourable Members,
28. More than the physical distance of the North East from Delhi, it was the emotional disconnect that disheartened the people of the region. My Government has transformed this situation by working tirelessly during the last five years. Work is being done at an unprecedented pace in the North East to enhance connectivity, strengthen infrastructure and make people’s lives easier. As a result of these efforts of the Government, by 2022, the capitals of Sikkim, Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland will be connected to the rail network. The work on Agartala-Akhaura rail link is also progressing at a fast pace. In the year 2022, the construction of the new airport being built at ‘Holongi’ in Arunachal Pradesh will also be completed.
29. Besides this, construction of AIIMS in Guwahati, bio-refinery in Numaligarh and sports university in Manipur are also progressing at a fast pace. Recently, the Government has sanctioned about Rs 9,000 crore for the North East Gas Grid Project. This project will lay the foundation of a Gas Based Economy in all the 8 States of the North East.
30. The Central and Assam Governments have recently signed a historic agreement with the Bodo Organizations to bring an end to the 5 decade-old Bodo dispute. With this agreement, a complex problem, that has claimed more than 4000 lives, has been resolved. After this agreement, the Government will spend Rs1500 crore for the development of Bodo community. Similarly, another landmark agreement between Tripura, Mizoram, the Central Government and the Bru community has not only resolved a decades-old problem but has also ensured a secure life for thousands of people belonging to the Bru community.
Honourable Members,
31. My Government is committed to bringing the brothers and sisters from the tribal community of the country into the mainstream of development. For the first time, Government has extended the benefit of MSP to forest produce. My Government’s special emphasis is on the health, education and skill development of the tribals. Only a few weeks ago, the Government has launched a programme for opening more than 400 Eklavya Model Residential Schools in the country. Recently, reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies has also been extended for the next ten years.
Honourable Members,
32. My Government is also constantly striving for the social, economic and educational progress of the minority community. Through Hunar Haat, employment opportunities have been provided to 2 lakh 65 thousand skilled artisans belonging to the minority community. Scholarships have been granted in large numbers to Muslim students to enable them to continue their education without interruption.
33. On the special request of my Government, an unprecedented increase in Haj quota was made by Saudi Arabia as a result of which a record 2 lakh Indian Muslims performed the Haj this time. India is the first country where the entire process of Haj pilgrimage has been made digital and online. The Government is also undertaking 100 percent digitization of Waqf properties across the country so that these properties can be utilised for the welfare of the Muslim community.
Honourable Members,
34. My Government is working with utmost sensitivity towards fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the divyangjan. Along with increase in reservations and legal empowerment, more than 1000 Government buildings and more than 700 railway stations have been made accessible for divyangjan. In the last 5 years, aids and assistive devices worth Rs 900 crore were distributed to the divyangjan by organising camps. The Government is creating a national database of divyangjan and e-Unique Identification Cards have been issued to more than 25 lakh divyangjan. My Government, in its previous term, had undertaken a special initiative for preparing the Indian Sign Language Dictionary. It gives me pleasure to inform the House that a special dictionary of 6 thousand words has been prepared.
Honourable Members,
35. India has always believed in the principle of equal respect for all faiths. However, at the time of Partition, this very belief of India and of its people came under the most severe attack. In the environment prevailing in the aftermath of partition, the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had said: “Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India. It is the duty of the Government of India to ensure a normal life for them.” Many national leaders and political parties have from time to time supported this idea of Pujya Bapu and further propagated it. It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both the Houses of Parliament have fulfilled this wish, by enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act. At a time when the country is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi ji, all of you have given paramount consideration to this sentiment. I congratulate both the Houses of Parliament and all the MPs for this.
Honourable Members,
36. We have all been witness to the increase in the atrocities on minorities in Pakistan over time. We have all seen what happened in Nankana Sahib recently. It is the responsibility of all of us to bring the atrocities being committed in Pakistan to the notice of the global community.
37. While condemning the atrocities on the minorities in Pakistan, I urge the world community to take cognizance of it and take necessary steps in this regard.
Honourable Members,
38. My Government would like to clarify once again that the procedures which have existed for people from all faiths of the world who believe in India and who wish to obtain Indian citizenship, remain unchanged. A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India. The Government has made several provisions to ensure that granting citizenship to those who have been compelled to take shelter in India does not have any adverse cultural impact on any region, especially the North East.
39. Honourable Members,
The great saint poet of India, Thiruvalluvar had said –
‘Urruvar Ulgattaark AaniyaTattraad, Erru-vaare Ellaam Porutt’
That is, “Like a linchpin of an axle, a farmer holds together the entire world. He bears the burden of those people who cannot cultivate land.”
40. Our country is indebted to our farmers who are our annadata, because of whose hard work we are self-reliant in foodgrain. Bringing about a change in the lives of farmers who serve the country selflessly and development of rural areas, are the priorities of my Government. The Government is going to spend an amount of Rs 25 lakh crore in the coming years to strengthen the rural economy. Government is working on a strategy to develop an income centric system aimed at doubling the income of farmers.
Honourable Members,
41. Under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, more than Rs 43 thousand crore has been deposited in the bank accounts of more than 8 crore farmer families. On 2nd January this month, my Government has created a record by transferring Rs 12 thousand crore to the bank accounts of 6 crore farmers simultaneously.
42. My Government is working with dedication to provide the farmers, prices which are one and a half times the input cost. Steady increase in MSP for Kharif and Rabi crops is a step in this direction. Due to the efforts of the Government the procurement of pulses and oilseeds has increased by more than 20 times.
Honourable Members,
43. My Government is also promoting alternative farming practices. Along with cluster-based horticulture, organic farming is also being promoted and propagated. The production of honey has increased by about 60 per cent due to the efforts made by the Government in this area. The export of honey has also more than doubled. In order to build further on this accomplishment, the National Bee-Keeping and Honey Mission has been approved.
44. The twin objectives of doubling the fishermen’s income and fish production are sought to be achieved through the newly created Department of Fisheries. A massive drive is being organized with the aim of ensuring the health of more than 50 crore livestock of the country. Under the National Animal Disease Control Programme, an amount of Rs 13 thousand crore is being spent on immunization and other measures to protect the cattle from Foot and Mouth Disease.
Honourable Members,
45. My Government along with the State Governments is working with sensitivity to provide relief to farmers from natural calamities. Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, on an average, every year, more than five and a half crore farmers are availing crop insurance cover at a very low premium. Under this scheme in the last three years, claims of farmers to the tune of Rs 57 thousand crore have been settled.
46. The impact of e-NAM, the online national market for farmers has also started becoming visible. 1 crore 65 lakh farmers and about 1 lakh 25 thousand traders of the country have been linked to it. About Rs 90 thousand crore worth of business has been transacted through this platform. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of e-NAM in this decade, work is underway to link more than 400 new mandis with it.
Honourable Members,
47. The health of an individual has impact on the development of both the family and the country. My Government is working with a holistic approach in the area of health. Serious efforts are being made at every level in preventive and curative healthcare. Many schemes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission, Poshan Abhiyan, Fit India Movement, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, are contributing to improving the health of the people.
48. The wide ranging impact of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme on the health sector of the country is visible. Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, so far 75 lakh poor have availed free treatment. More than 27 thousand Health and Wellness Centres have also been set up.
Honourable Members,
49. Due to the decisions taken by my Government, medical expenses of the poor and the middle class have been reduced considerably. Capping of prices of more than 1000 essential medicines has resulted in a saving of Rs 12,500 crore for the patients. Reduced cost of stents and knee-implants has provided huge relief to lakhs of patients. Every day 5 to 7 lakh patients are now purchasing medicines for serious ailments at affordable prices from more than 6,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
50. By setting up the National Medical Commission, my Government has reaffirmed its commitment to reform medical education and healthcare. 75 new medical colleges have been sanctioned this year, which will result in an increase in MBBS seats by about 16 thousand and PG seats by more than 4 thousand. In addition, 22 AIIMS have been sanctioned for various parts of the country, construction work for which is in progress.
51. My Government is also making special efforts to improve the health of women. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, about Rs 5 thousand crore has been transferred by the Government directly to the bank accounts of 1 crore 20 lakh women of the country. Under Mission Indradhanush, 3 crore 50 lakh infants and about 90 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated. Benefits of these schemes are particularly visible in areas inhabited by dalits and tribals. My Government has also started making oxo-biodegradable sanitary napkins ‘Suvidha’ available for just one rupee.
Honourable Members,
52. Because of the efforts of my Government to promote entrepreneurship and livelihood for women, more than 6 crore 60 lakh women have already joined the Self Help Group movement. These women are being provided credit at low interest rates. In order to provide equal opportunities, for the first time women have been allowed to work during the night shift also in both under-ground and open cast mines. It is with this same objective of promoting gender equality that admission of girls has been permitted in Sainik Schools for the first time. Appointment of women in the Military Police is also underway. For the first time the Indian Air Force is providing new opportunities for women to work in the fighter stream and as defence attachés.
Honourable Members,
53. My Government is working with sensitivity for ensuring the safety of women. In order to enhance women’s safety, more than 600 One Stop Centers have been set up in the country. A national database has been created to identify the perpetrators of crimes against women. More than 1 thousand Fast Track Special Courts will be set up across the country to ensure speedy justice in such cases. It has also been decided to set up a Women Help Desk in every police station of the country. For heinous crimes like sexual offence against children, Government has made a provision even for capital punishment.
Honourable Members,
54. The 21st century is referred to as the Century of Knowledge and the priority of the Government is to prepare the youth to provide leadership in this field. In the areas related to Research, Innovation, Incubation and Start-Ups, it is the youth who will be at the forefront in this decade. The youth are benefitting continuously from the policy decisions taken by my Government in this regard. Today, India is home to the world’s third largest start-up ecosystem. Under the Start-Up India campaign, recognition has been accorded to 27 thousand new start-ups in the country. The number of patents granted in the country has increased four times in the last five years, whereas trademark registrations have increased five-fold.
55. Through the Skill India Mission and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme, along with skill development the youth are also being provided with necessary funds for self-employment. More than 5 crore 54 lakh new entrepreneurs in the country have availed loans under the Mudra scheme. So far, credit in excess of Rs 10 lakh crore has been sanctioned under this scheme.

Government has initiated action for appointment of about 7 thousand teachers in Kendriya Vidyalayas and 12 thousand teachers in Higher Education Institutions. ‘Swayam2’ has also been introduced by the Government to strengthen the online education system.
57. I am delighted to inform you that for the first time ever in the history of the country, number of girls admitted in higher education has exceeded that of boys.
Honourable Members,
58. Our youth have the potential to transform India into a great sporting power in the world. Under various schemes, including the Khelo India programme and the Olympic Podium Scheme, young talent is being identified and provided with requisite training to compete at the highest level. The third phase of Khelo India programme has been successfully concluded in Guwahati just a few days back. It is worth noting that 80 new national records were set there, of which 56 were set by women.
Honourable Members,
59. This year 1st August marks the hundredth death anniversary of the great freedom fighter, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who had given the clarion call that Swaraj is our birth right. After attainment of Swaraj, the nation has now started moving towards Suraaj. Moving rapidly towards the goal of Suraaj, my Government is working at three levels:
First – Transforming the work culture in Government and strengthening institutions,

Second – Use of modern technology to promote transparency,

And third – promoting healthy competition and public participation at the grassroot level.

Honourable Members,
60. Following the fundamental principle of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”, several reforms have been undertaken by the Government. With its recent abolition of 58 more laws, the number of laws abolished by the Government has now reached about 1500. Reforms in recruitment process for every level are underway in order to promote transparency. The youth are benefitting from the decision to discontinue interviews for most of the Group B posts and Group C posts.
Honourable Members,
61. Coordination among Departments and dismantling of silos are absolutely essential for successful implementation of schemes. In this direction, organization of a common Foundation Course for officers of more than 20 Civil Services in October last year is an important step. Recently, the management of Indian Railways has also been restructured. To make the functioning of various Tribunals in the country more effective, the Tribunal system too is being reformed. New Ministries have also been created to facilitate better target orientation of schemes. Creation of the Ministry of Skill Development and the Ministry of Jal Shakti by the Government is an example of this thought process.
Honourable Members,
62. Fast and accurate delivery of Government services and benefits has been the hallmark of my Government. This has been made possible by application of technology as a basis of good governance on an unprecedented scale. Identification of beneficiaries in a transparent manner, transfer of 100 per cent assistance directly to bank accounts of beneficiaries and use of modern technology in monitoring of schemes have made the lives of the poor and the middle class easier. This technology will also help in improving the quality of life of our countrymen during this decade.
Honourable Members,
63. We are all aware that digital technology is the foundation of the Industrial Revolution Industry 4.0. My Government has focused on Digital Access, Digital Inclusion and Digital Empowerment in an unparalleled manner through the Digital India Programme in order to take full advantage of the Industrial Revolution in the 21st century. It is a matter of pride for the country that digital systems developed in India during the last five years have been a source of inspiration for several countries of the world.
Honourable Members,
64. Today, more than 121 crore people in the country have Aadhaar cards and about 60 crore people possess RuPay cards. A record value of Rs 2 lakh crore has been transacted through UPI in December 2019. Recently, the Government has also launched a new version of the BHIM App.
65. The Government has linked about 450 schemes to Direct Benefit Transfer or DBT by using the JAM Trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile. An amount of over Rs 9 lakh crore has been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT, during the last 5 years. By plugging the leakages, my Government has saved about Rs 1 lakh 70 thousand crore from going into the wrong hands.
66. The Government e-Marketplace, GeM has brought about transparency in Government procurement. GeM has not only opened up a huge market, in the form of the Government, for the small and micro entrepreneurs, it has also connected the Government directly with the entrepreneurs. During the last three years, about Rs 40 thousand crore worth of procurement has been done by different Government Departments through GeM.
67. By leveraging technology, my Government has taken several major steps to end the Inspector Raj. Now we are also developing a system in the Income Tax Department which would be devoid of any human interface. This system will increase transparency and improve work culture in the tax department.
Honourable Members,
68. Technology plays a major role in bringing cities and villages closer. So far, more than 1 lakh 25 thousand Gram Panchayats have been connected with high speed broadband under the BharatNet scheme. In 2014, there were 60 thousand Common Service Centres in rural areas of the country, which have now increased to more than 3 lakh 65 thousand. This has provided employment to more than 12 lakh villagers. Through these centres, the Government is delivering more than 45 services in rural areas.
Honourable Members,
69. In order to strengthen the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, My Government is developing integrated and organized systems for the countrymen, through use of technology.
70. Recently, One Nation, One FasTag has been launched to ensure seamless mobility in the country. One Nation One Mobility Card has enabled use of the same card for different modes of transport across different States. One Nation, One Ration Card is also being launched by the Government. One Nation, One Tax, that is GST, has also promoted transparency in trade and commerce through use of technology. In the pre GST period, more than two dozen different taxes had to be paid. Now, not only the complex tax web has come to an end, the incidence of tax has also been reduced.
Honourable Members,
71. In a federal country like India it is imperative for fast paced development, that States compete with each other in development schemes; and also share experiences with each other. My Government has therefore been consistently emphasizing Competitive Cooperative Federalism. The Government is ranking States on the basis of real time data collected at district and village level. Its impact is visible in various areas ranging from Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to Ease of Doing Business and Smart City Mission to Aspirational District Programme.
72. Information collected during the Census plays a crucial role in enabling Governments in formulation of appropriate schemes and targeted interventions. This time digital technology is being used, in the conduct of Census, to collect information so as to complete the process expeditiously.
73. My Government is committed to protecting privacy amidst the increasing use of digital technology. To fulfil this commitment, Government has introduced the Data Protection Bill in the Parliament.
Honourable Members,
74. My Government is committed to attaining the goal of making India a USD 5 trillion economy. Towards this objective, Government is making efforts at all levels of the economy, in consultation with all stakeholders. In spite of global challenges, the fundamentals of Indian economy are strong. Our foreign exchange reserves have reached a historical high of over USD 450 billion. Inflow of Foreign Direct Investment to India is also on the rise. As compared to last year, FDI has increased by USD 3 billion between April and October this year.
75. On the other hand, merger of small Public Sector Banks has strengthened them and improved their lending capacity. In the first half of this financial year, 12 Public Sector Banks have reported profits. Due to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crores have also been recovered by the banks and other institutions. Reduction of corporate tax and the codification of Labour Laws will increase ease of doing business in India.
Honourable Members,
76. My Government is providing impetus to Make in India to accelerate the growth rate of the economy and to boost manufacturing and exports. Government is developing two defence corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, in addition to 5 Industrial Corridors in the country.
Honourable Members,
77. India is making rapid strides in electronics manufacturing sector in particular. National Policy on Electronics has been formulated to give further impetus to the manufacturing of mobile phones, TVs and other electronic devices. The value of electronic equipment manufactured in the country has increased to Rs 4 lakh 58 thousand crore in 2018-19, as against Rs 1 lakh 90 thousand crore in 2014-15. In 2014, there were only 2 companies manufacturing mobiles in India. Today India is the second-largest mobile manufacturing hub in the world. Make in India is also being encouraged by the Government in automobile sector and railways. Full indigenous manufacturing of modern trains like Vande Bharat and Tejas Express is in progress.
Honourable Members,
78. The fundamental mantra of independence was a Self-reliant India. A self-reliant India is possible only when every Indian takes pride in every product made in India. My Government believes in the mantra of ‘Buy local for a better tomorrow’. I urge every representative of the people, from Panchayat level to the Parliament, and every Government in the country, to transform the philosophy of ‘Buy local for a better tomorrow’ into a movement. I also urge every Indian to give priority to local products. By using locally manufactured products, you will be able to help the small entrepreneurs in your area to a great extent.
Honourable Members,
79. The poor and the middle classes hope and aspire for a modern 21st century infrastructure in the country. To fulfil this aspiration of the people more than Rs 100 lakh crore will be invested in the next five years. With a special emphasis on connectivity, the Government is also focusing on creation of new highways, new waterways, new airways, and new I-ways.
80. Rural roads contribute significantly to the country’s infrastructure. Rural roads have now been expanded to every corner of the country through the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. Third phase of the programme has been launched to strengthen rural roads and connect them to schools, hospitals and agricultural markets. 1 lakh 25 thousand kilometers of roads will be constructed and upgraded under this programme.
81. Inland waterways are also being developed by the Government. In December 2019, for the first time, container cargo reached Pandu in Assam via National Water Way-2. Under the Jal Marg Vikas Project, the multi-modal terminal at Haldia on River Ganga and the navigation lock at Farakka will be completed this year. It is also our endeavour to operate large transport cargo vessels on River Ganga by next year.
82. Rapid progress is being made towards providing better public transport facilities in urban areas. Metro facility has now been extended to 18 cities in the country. So far, 670 km of metro lines have been operationalized, and work on another 930 km is underway. The residents of Delhi and NCR have greatly benefitted from the construction of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, as well as from Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways.
Honourable Members,
83. Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities of the country are emerging in a new role towards achieving the goal of USD 5 trillion economy. The progress of small cities in areas relating to sanitation, amenities, start-ups or other commercial activities has been encouraging. Since 2014, start-ups in small cities have grown at a rate of 45 to 50 per cent. Similarly, about 35 lakh people have so far travelled by air under the UDAN scheme. Last year, 335 new air routes have been approved. It is estimated that in the coming years, more than half of the country’s digital transactions will take place in these tier-2 and tier-3 cities.
84. My Government is doing its utmost to fulfil the developmental aspirations of small cities and the new middle class. The middle class in small towns has also benefitted the most from tax exemption on income up to Rs. 5 lakhs. The middle class families with annual income of up to Rs 18 lakhs are able to save between Rs 5 to 6 lakh on home loans with tenure up to 20 years. It is the middle class that will benefit the most from the Rs 25 thousand crore fund provided by the Government for completion of stalled housing projects.
Honourable Members,
85. India is playing an effective role globally in the field of clean energy. Due to the efforts of the Government, LPG coverage in the country has increased from 55 per cent to about 97 per cent. City gas distribution is now being extended to 407 districts of the country. Now we are moving towards a gas-based economy.
86. Keeping environment conservation in mind, my Government has enhanced the target for producing renewable energy to 450 gigawatts. Under the Pradhan Mantri-Kusum Yojana, it has been targeted to provide more than 17 lakh solar pumps to farmers across the country. Similarly, under the second phase of the solar rooftop programme, the target is to generate 38 gigawatt of electricity.
Honourable Members,
87. The efforts of the countrymen have made it possible to expand India’s tree and forest cover by 13 thousand square kilometers during the last four years. Similarly, the number of tigers has increased to 2,967 in July 2019 from 2,226 in 2014, which is a matter of satisfaction.
88. To address the issue of air and water pollution, the Government will be implementing the National Clean Air Programme in 102 cities of the country. I am glad that the positive impact of the Namami Gange Mission launched by the Government has now started becoming visible. Under this mission, projects worth Rs 7 thousand crore have been completed and projects worth more than Rs 21 thousand crore are in progress.
89. The impact of all these efforts is also visible on the country’s tourism sector. During the last few years, there has been extraordinary development of infrastructure related to tourism. Recently a nationwide programme has been launched from Kolkata for conservation and beautification of the heritage buildings of the country. The tourism sector is also being strengthened by the modern infrastructure being developed under Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes. New records are being created every day in the number of tourists visiting the ‘Statue of Unity’, the statue of Sardar Patel; which is the tallest in the world.
Honourable Members,
90. It is the belief of my Government that paying tribute to the great personalities who dedicated their lives to the nation and contributed towards preserving the heritage of the country is an important part of nation-building. With this idea, museums celebrating the contributions made by the brave tribals, both men and women, during our freedom struggle are being set up in different States. The 250th birth anniversary of the great social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy, whose teachings guided the nation, will also be celebrated in 2022 by the Government in a befitting manner.
Honourable Members,
91. The objective of India’s space programme has always been service to humanity. Due to the tireless work of country’s space scientists, Chandrayaan-2 has stimulated a new interest in technology among the country’s youth. My Government has already approved Chandrayaan-3. ISRO is also working expeditiously on the manned spacecraft programme – Gaganyaan, as well as Aditya-1 Mission.
Honourable Members,
92. In these evolving times, to meet the new and complex challenges related to the defence of the country, my Government is working to make the defence forces stronger, more effective and modern. The appointment of CDS, the Chief of Defence Staff and creation of the Department of Military Affairs are steps in this direction. This will also improve coordination among the three services, while speeding up their modernization and the process of making them self-reliant.
93. We are fully attentive to the requirements of our security forces, including adequate armaments, safety equipment and bullet proof jackets. Manufacture of state-of-the-art AK 203 rifles, in collaboration with Russia, will commence in the Ordnance Factory at Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. Recently, when the Naval Prototype of Tejas landed and took off from INS Vikramaditya, every Indian was filled with pride. The Government has also taken historic steps in enhancing space security. With the successful testing of A-Sat, India has become the fourth country in the world to attain strike capability in space.
Honourable Members,
94. My Government is working with full strength and determination to free the country from the scourge of terrorism. In view of the changing nature of terrorism, alertness on the part of the citizens is extremely helpful. The decrease in terrorist activities in Jammu Kashmir demonstrates that public cooperation can be effective in the fight against terrorism. My Government has given the security forces a free hand in taking the strongest measures against those indulging in terrorism. The security situation in the North East has also improved significantly due to the concerted efforts of the Government. The geographical spread of Naxalism is also steadily shrinking.
Honourable Members,
95. My Government is of the view that foreign policy is a vital ingredient of the country’s economic and strategic security. We are stimulating economic growth and prosperity by increasing connectivity with our neighbouring countries. “Neighbourhood First” policy is our priority. Apart from our neighbours, we have also strengthened relations with other countries of the world. This is why a number of countries have bestowed their highest honour on India. Our cooperation with ASEAN and African countries is being taken to a new level.
96. After International Solar Alliance, India has been at the forefront of a global partnership, Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure-CDRI. This step aimed at mitigating natural disasters will further strengthen India’s stature as a sensitive world power.
Honourable Members,
97. This decade, which has just begun, will determine India’s global standing in the times to come. The world will witness an inclusive, prosperous, capable and powerful New India in this decade. Hence it is the bounden duty of every Member of this House and every countryman to strive hard with all their capability to achieve their respective goals.
98. We should all strive to make every citizen conscious of and dedicated to his duties in the national interest, and ensure that this sense of responsibility becomes the guiding principle of our civic life. Come, let us together make this decade of 2020 the decade of fulfilling our duties.
99. We must always remember that we are first and foremost citizens of this country, and leaders or supporters of a particular ideology thereafter. The prestige of our country should be more important than our party loyalties.
100. It is my belief that in the times to come, all of us together, drawing inspiration from the glorious past of our country, will make every possible effort to ensure a bright future for the country; and that we will also succeed in our endeavour.
101. Let us all come together to fulfil the dream of a New India; let us together make a New India.
Jai Hind !!!"

What is Chandi Padvo?
On Chandi Padvo, tradition has it that people of Surat eat only sweetmeats that are white and hence doodh poha, kheer or ghari are made across households. Ghari, a dish made of maida filled with mava, pistachios, almonds and sugar, and fried in ghee and then dipped in ghee to give it a white coat, is native to Surat and is most popular on this day. Incidentally, the sweetmeat resembles the full moon.
Surat-based historian Sanjay Choksi says, when the Marathas fought with the British in the 18th century, Tatya Tope came to Surat with his army and were tired from the long journey. “To give energy booster to the army, Tatya Tope had shared the recipe of Ghari, a mixture of sugar, ghee, dry fruits, and milk mava, stuffed in dough, and fried topped with a coat of ghee, with the halwai, who made it for his army,” he explains, about how this port city fell in love with the snack.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This incident is mentioned in the book by historian Dr Mohan Meghani titled “Surat of 18th century”. In fact, Ghari has become synonymous with Surat over the years.
Ghari also emerged as a favourite on Chandni Padvo, when Surtis head to Dumas or Ubhrat beaches in the evening and have it with Bhusu, a namkeen mix found in central and south Gujarat.

Covid 19 and Chandi Padvo
Because of the pandemic, the Surat Municipal Corporation has urged people not to head out and crowd the public spaces, with Chandi Padvo falling on a Sunday this year. This year however, the festival is likely to be different as the Dumas and Ubhrat beaches, popular venues for the celebration, have not opened since the lockdown.
It is expected that people would now celebrate on the roadside footpaths, and bridges, with their families. There will be heavy police deployment on the roads to prevent people from gathering, said sources . 📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram
This year, a sweetmeat vendor has added a novel element to the ghari by coating it with gold leaves and selling it for Rs 9,000 a kg. The shop, called ’24 carat’, which has six branches in Surat city had this year introduced Gold ghari. From a single shop in Piplod area, around six kilos of ghari was sold on Saturday, while in the other shops sale varied from 2 kilos to four kilos, said shop owner Rita Ghariwala.
She said the Ghari on Chandi Padva is also given as a gift from a father to his children and their families. “Earlier, we believed we will not get any business, but as the people have started coming, we are meeting the sale demand and have increased the production.”

The Ghari makers
Rohan Mithaiwala, a fourth generation sweet maker, said the process of preparing Ghari starts ten days before Chandi Padva. “The Ghari prices are little high, starting from Rs 700 to Rs 850, but still people purchase it. We also get orders from different community organisations,” he said, estimating that nearly 150 tonnes is consumed in the city every Chandi Padvo."

The management at the Statue of Unity has been at the receiving end from tourists after one of the two high-speed elevators at the tourist spot in Kevadia Colony stopped functioning, resulting in serpentine queues and several hours of wait for those wanting to visit the viewing gallery of the statue.
On Wednesday, for a third time in four days, one of the two elevators stopped working with the lone working elevator being insufficient to handle the rush. Irate tourists demanded that their tickets be refunded as many of them were unable to make it to the gallery even after waiting for nearly four hours. The site had witnessed much chaos on December 2 and 4 when a similar situation arose due to malfunctioning lifts.
An official said that while tickets have been capped at 6,500 persons per day for the viewing gallery, the rush has already taken its toll on the lifts.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
IK Patel, Narmada District Collector and CEO of SoU, rushed to the spot to handle the situation.
Each elevator is designed to carry 26 passengers and cover the distance of 153 meters in 30 seconds. Patel said, “We have contacted the Mumbai-based company that has installed these elevators to send its technicians immediately. The problem will be resolved soon.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Patel also said that plans to construct more public toilets at the site have materialised. He said all efforts were being made to make December 15, the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a special day as President Ramnath Kovind will visit the spot on the day to pay his respects."

(Source: Express Photo/File)
A year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity last year, a grand event will mark the October anniversary this year. Modi is expected to inaugurate or perform the foundation-stone-laying ceremony of close to 30 peripheral projects associated with the world’s tallest statue.
Officials of various departments of the state administration are working relentlessly to complete the list. In fact, a circular in the beginning of vacation season in May even barred hundreds of government officials stationed in Kevadia colony from taking leave until October to avoid delays the ongoing projects.
Among the 30 projects are Shreshth Bharat Bhavan, Ekta Mall, a butterfly park, a nutrition Park, a mirror Maze, several State Bhavans, a safari Park, a tent city and a tribal museum. Sources also say that Modi will also perform the foundation-stone-laying ceremony for the aerodrome terminal that is to come up at Pond 3 of the Narmada dam premises, for which the state government has also allocated funds of Rs 5 crore in the budget this week. Authorities have also issued a fresh tender to restart the helicopter service that allowed visitors to take an aerial tour of the statue and the dam at Rs 2,900 per head. The service was suspended during the Lok Sabha polls as the contractor who was providing the service pulled out to cater to other demands.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Officials are tight-lipped about the details of the projects that are a part of an ambitious plan to turn Kevadia colony into a sought-after tourist destination. However, sources say that the safari park, “first of its kind in India”, will house over 1,500 animals of various species, both Indian and international. “The plan is to import animals from international parks, including giraffes, kangaroos, pandas, koalas and ostriches,” an official of the forest department said. “Proposals to channelise the import of the animals are being worked on. The animals will be housed in open spaces that mimic their natural habitats, and visitors will move around in electric cars.”
The Ekta Mall, an extension of State Bhavans, will soon come up at the site to signify the unity of the country. “It is a haat concept where artisans of other states can sell their handicrafts. We have tried a similar concept of local artisans from Narmada and tourists have appreciated it,” said CEO of the Statue of Unity, IK Patel. He said four states have given consent to develop the Bhavans. “Haryana has paid us the money for the land as well,” he added.
Two high-profile conferences lined up
Prime Minister Modi will not just inaugurate projects but visit the site before October to address two consecutive seminars – the foreign ministry’s annual Heads of Missions (HoMs) conference as well as a conference of the country’s probationary civil services officers including IAS, IRS, IPS and IRS. While the MEA conference is extremely significant as it is the first time that it will be held outside Delhi and attended by the ambassadors of India and other high-level diplomats, the meeting of probationary civil servants is also expected to bring a huge number of visitors to the site.
“The tent city expansion is one of the major projects that need to be completed,” an official said. “There are a total of 35 air-conditioned tents right now and the target is to complete 80 by end of August to mid-September in order to accommodate the visitors.” The official said the Prime Minister is likely to be here for two days in September for the conference. “We have also received details of a possible union cabinet meeting in Kevadia Colony near the Statue of unity around the same time.”
The tent city is being created on the lines of such an existing service in Kutch where visitors can rent tents for night stay and also order entertainment and food to have a good time, the official said, adding, “The aerodrome’s activity will also commence soon, as we are expecting the chief minister and cabinet ministers of Gujarat to visit next week to take stock of the various projects. For most officials stationed in Kevadia colony, Diwali this year on October 27 will be a very tiring one.”"

The inaugural flight will take off from Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad to the Statue of Unity in Kevadia colony in Narmada district, to be operated by private airline SpiceJet.
In a release on Saturday, the state government announced that a MoU was signed on July 22 this year between Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and Airports Authority of India to start the “first-ever seaplane services in Gujarat to provide seamless and affordable air connectivity from Sabarmati Riverfront, Ahmedabad to the Statue of Unity, Kevadia. The kind of service is first ever in the country,” the release said.
The service may be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said an official. Modi is likely to be visiting Gujarat around that time to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, as ‘Rashtriya Ekta Divas’ which, government sources have told this paper, might be accorded the stature of the Republic Day celebrations.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi had taken a seaplane flight from Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad to Dharoi in December 2017, ahead of the Gujarat assembly polls that year.
According to the statement, the water aerodrome scheme is being implemented by the terms and conditions of a tripartite agreement between the state government, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), and the Airports Authority of India.
“In this connection, a high-level meeting was organised on August 29 at New Sachivalaya, Gandhinagar to review the progress of the water aerodrome operation in Gujarat which was chaired by Chief Secretary, along with the Secretary, Civil Aviation, Joint Secretary, Civil Aviation, DOG- DGCA, Concerned officials from Airports Authority of India, Airline Operator (Spicejet), and other government officials from state and central governments.”
Officials said that SpiceJet will operate a 19-seater plane, which will be able to accommodate 14 passengers. “There will be four flights a day between Ahmedabad and Kevadia on each side — which means four arrivals and four departures. The ticket price per person will be about Rs 4,800. Anyone wishing to cut down on their travel time between Ahmedabad and Kevadia which currently takes about four hours one way, can do so by turning it into a day’s trip. Return tickets can be booked on the seaplane to ensure that the passengers can return to Ahmedabad from Kevadia during the day. The journey by seaplane will be about one hour,” the official said.
At Kevadia, work on completing the sea plane terminal is underway at the Dyke 3 of the Narmada dam premises. In September 2019, the District Collector of Narmada had issued orders to restrict traffic movement within the premises of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam, temporarily closing the exit road along the three natural ponds that also served as a scenic drive for tourists. The administration has begun the work of isolating Dyke 3, which was chosen as the location for seaplane terminal in July 2018. The Batherymetric and Hydrographic survey were conducted by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).
The rock-filled pond is officially named Panchmuli Lake and popularly called the ‘Magar Talav’ as it is infested with crocodiles. The site was finalised for terminal as its dimensions suit the requirements of landing the seaplane, which requires a minimum width of 900 metres in a water body with a depth of at least six feet. This is not the first time that Panchmuli lake has been chosen for tourist activity. The lake was a boating spot until 2013 when a stranded boat with about 60 tourists was surrounded by crocodiles, causing much panic among authorities"

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Sunday visited the site of the Statue of Unity at Kevadia colony in Narmada to review the project, which is set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31. Rupani said that the state government would make PM Modi’s “dream” of installing the world’s largest statue dedicated to Sardar Patel come true.
Rupani, accompanied by Chief Secretary J N Singh, as well as officials of the SSNNL and Narmada district administration, visited Sadhu Bet, 3.5 km downstream the Narmada dam, the site where the 182-meter tall statue is under construction. “It was the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to construct the world’s largest statue dedicated to Sardar Patel, as a tribute to his greatness and tall stature. Gujarat will make his (Modi’s) dream come true by having the inauguration of the statue at the hands of the Prime Minister. Not just the statue, but in order to accord Kevadia the status of a world tourism destination, Modiji has also envisaged and gifted us a tribal museum, recreational garden and other attractions,” the CM said.
While Rupani did not declare the official date of the inauguration, the state government has previously expressed its intention to inaugurate the statue on October 31, which coincides with the 143rd birth anniversary of Patel this year. An announcement to this effect was previously made by Chief Secretary Singh, during his last visit to the site earlier this year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to officials of SSNNL, the instructions have been clearly conveyed to ensure that the construction is complete by mid-October to enable the government to make preparations for the grand October 31 inauguration ceremony, which will see the presence of several VVIPs.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Officials confirmed that Rupani viewed a presentation on the various stages of the project that will be completed by October 31, including the bronze cladding of the outer facade of the statue. The SSNNL officials said that so far, the engineering teams working on the structure have erected over 151 metres of the statue, which will form the chest of the statue."

State agriculture department officials said that against 600 farmers from Bihar who were expected to participate in the event,only 150 of them turned up.
Requesting anonymity,a senior agriculture department official,who has been involved in planning and executing the event,said politics was the reason behind the low participation of famers from Bihar. JD(U) broke up with the BJP over the party projecting Chief Minister Narendra Modi as BJPs prime ministerial candidate. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had openly opposed Modi as PM candidate. 
The official said the political bickering between the two parties also delayed the list of progressive farmers to be awarded at a function on Tuesday. While the names of farmers from all other states had been received well in time and published in the souvenir for the summit,the names of Bihar farmers are missing from the 82-page souvenir. The official said the names from Bihar came only after the souvenir had been printed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to state agriculture department officials,over 4,000 farmers from 29 states,two Union Territories and 542 districts across the country participated in the summit.

(Reuters)
An Indian-American foundry owner, who claimed that he had been invited to participate in building the world’s largest statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel in Gujarat, has been sentenced to prison for selling fake bronze sculptures for millions of dollars in the US.
Brian Ramnarine, 60, of Queens was sentenced in Manhattan federal court to 30 months in prison for fraudulently selling and attempting to sell, for more than USD 11 million, bronze sculptures that he falsely represented to be works of art by prominent artists Jasper Johns, Robert Indiana and Saint Clair Cemin, federal prosecutor Preet Bharara said in a statement.
Ramnarine, who was arrested in November 2012 and had pled guilty in January this year, was also sentenced by US District Judge John Koeltl to three years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit the fake sculptures and pay about USD 70,000 to his victims and as forfeiture.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Described by Bharara as a “con artist”, he was given special permission by Koeltl to attend the September 28 grand reception hosted by the Indian-American community at Madison Square Garden here in honour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Indian leader was also allegedly presented with a ‘Peace Warrior’ statue that Ramnarine had cast, according to a report in the Courthouse News Service.
Ramnarine’s lawyer Troy Smith said in a New York Daily News report the prison time would cost his client a big opportunity as he had been invited to participate in the building of Patel’s statue, touted as the world’s largest once completed.
A project close to his heart, Modi has set aside USD 33 million to help fund the construction of the bronze-and-iron ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat.
Ramnarine admitted to the charges five days into his trial early this year and during his sentencing he told the judge that he is “sorry to bring shame on my family.”
The prison term is well below the eight to 10 years Ramnarine faced. He has to report to prison in January next year.
Smith had sought a lenient sentence citing Ramnarine’s “serious health issues.”
Bharara said Ramnarine’s “only art was as a con artist” who concocted and carried out three separate schemes to peddle fake sculptures to unsuspecting buyers for millions of dollars, pretending that they had been made by well-known artists."

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of insulting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by sourcing from China material for Patel’s statue in Gujarat.
Addressing a rally at Chitrakoot in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh, Rahul said the Prime Minister was building the world’s tallest statue, but he was insulting Patel because his statue will have the label of “made in China” and not “made in India’’.
The Congress leader began his two-day visit of the poll-bound state by visiting Kamtanath temple. On his earlier visit to the state, he was welcomed to Bhopal by the Congress as “Shiv Bhakt”. On Thursday, he was greeted with posters at several places that described him as “Ram Bhakt”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rahul made the “made in China” remark while speaking on the issue of unemployment. He said China was taking away lakhs of jobs that could have come to India’s unemployed youths. Rahul went on to add that he wanted to replace the “made in China” tag with “made in Chitrakoot” and names of other Indian cities in the next few years. “I want to see a Chinese youth take a selfie with a Made in Chitrakoot phone and wonder where the place is located,’’ he said.
“We will spend our energy to create and provide jobs,’’ Rahul said, adding that people were looking at the Congress to show the way.

New Delhi: BJP chief Amit Shah accused the “Gandhi family” of humiliating Sardar Patel after Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on the Patel statue. “Dear @Rahul Gandhi,your family humiliated Sardar Patel, unsuccessfully tried to erase his legacy from the people’s hearts and minds. Your lies on the ‘Statue of Unity’ is another display of your visceral hatred towards Sardar Patel,” Shah wrote on Twitter. “At a time when India is uniting to pay tributes to Sardar Patel by building a grand ‘Statue of Unity’ the Congress president is spreading canards to discredit the project.

After BJP candidate of Valsad K C Patel, Bardoli BJP candidate Prabhu Vasava had to face anger of tribals of Tapi district, whose farming lands are being acquired by the government for the Tapi-Par river linking project. A video of angry farmers confronting Vasava at a public meeting on Wednesday went viral. In it, the MP is seen trying to defend himself but then had to cut short his speech and leave.
Earlier K C Patel had to face the anger of the villagers of Tumbi village of Dharampur taluka in Valsad district where a BJP worker himself, Manilal Gavli, complained about the lack of development work in the village and the fact that the MP was visiting them for the first time in five years. Patel, along with other BJP leaders left the place hurriedly without responding.
In Vasava’s meeting in Lakhali village of Vyara taluka which falls in Bardoli Lok Sabha constituency of which Vasava is the sitting MP, several farmers came with copies of government circulars, even as one farmer identified as Mahendrabhai asked why tribals were displaced to erect the Statue of Unity of “Sardar Saheb” to which Vasava said, “It has been done after tribals willingly gave their land for the project.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
One BJP leader, Jagdishbhai, also tried to intervene but Vasava told him to remain quiet so that he could answer all the questions of the tribal farmers. Vasava is also heard telling the farmers that the Tapi project had been “scrapped”, in order to calm them down.
Bardoli is where independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had launched the farmers’ agitation which earned him the title of Sardar.
Vasava was accompanied by Tapi district BJP general secretary Rajendra Punwar and other local BJP leaders. He told the crowd that he would certainly win the election and stay an MP for another five years. “If you have any problems or issues, you should come to me. Even if you need my presence in your village, you can contact me and I will definitely come to your village to sort out the issues,” he said. To this, a tribal farmer identified as Nileshbhai Gamit, supported by other farmer, said, “There is no development work done in our village and after five years you have come to our village for first time requesting for votes. There are many issues we tribals are facing and the topmost issue is that the government has begun the procedure to acquire farming land for Tapi-Par river linking projects. Our lands and our residences will be snatched away and we will be displaced.”
As farmers began to recount how drone cameras had been deployed to survey their land, and produced the government papers related to the land acquisition, the situation got tense, and the BJP leaders sitting on the dais tried to intervene. But Vasava stopped them. Answering the question, Vasava said, “I know that this is for the first time I am coming to your village after five years. I am elected BJP MP and there are 1,250 villages and 400 taluka panchayats falling in Bardoli seat. After election I have to spend six months going to Delhi, and later after returning, I have to work for the party, so there is not enough time for me. I know that I have come here for the first time, but you have to understand.”
Vasava further added, “Now onwards if anybody comes to your village to acquire your farming land, call me I will definitely come and try to save your land. The government officials can acquire your land only if you farmers are willing”.
After this reply, there was a heated exchange of arguments between the BJP leaders and the affected farmers. Vasava had to cut short his speech and leave the spot after the situation turned tense. Local police stationed there also tried to control the anger of the affected local tribal farmers.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Vasava said, “There were a few farmers — and I suspect that they were agents of the Congress party — that tried to create a disturbance. They raised the issue of Tapi-Par river linking project and about their agricultural lands being acquired for it. I answered them that there is a rule that for any such project if 75 percent of the public are convinced, only then their land will be acquired and if not, nobody will take their land. It is a part of a political game that they have come to make representations. I heard their questions and gave them appropriate answers.”"

BJP working president J P Nadda Friday said his party aims to make India “Congress-mukt and BJP-yukt” to rid the country of corruption and policy-paralysis, and to empower the poor and deprived.
He also said the BJP is the largest party in the world and it aims to break its own record by bringing more number of people into its fold during the ongoing membership drive.
Nadda was addressing a small gathering of party workers at the airport on his arrival as part of his two-day Gujarat visit.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We want to make this country BJP-yukt and Congress mukt. When we talk about yukt (full of) and mukt (free of), we not only talk about a party, but also about the political culture…When we say Congress-mukt Bharat, it means India free of corruption, commission, policy-paralysis.
“When we talk about BJP-yukt Bharat, we talk about India serving its people, helping its poor, bringing the deprived and exploited people into the mainstream,” he said.
“We must understand that BJP is the world’s largest party with the largest number (of members) in the Parliament. BJP has broken its own record of 2014 (Lok Sabha election). Likewise, we received more votes (in 2019) than we did in 2014. For the first time, we have a non-Congress government that came back to power due to pro-incumbency,” he said.
Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani, other senior leaders and ministers were present on the occasion.
“We have decided that the BJP will break its own record in the membership drive and become an even larger party in the world. You all will join the membership drive and take this further,” he said.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on their leadership, Nadda recalled Shah’ statement that the party is yet to reach its pinnacle.
He urged the party workers to highlight the message of Mahatma Gandhi as the country celebrates his 150th birth anniversary.
“When we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi’s 150 birth anniversary, each and every BJP worker will go to the people and will explain to them all that for which Gandhi dedicated his life.
“Our aim is to tread the path shown by Gandhiji, in matters of cleanliness drive, water conservation, on both political and social issues,” he said.
Nadda is scheduled to hold meetings with party leaders and office-bearers at the BJP headquarters in Gandhinagar Friday and will visit the Statue of Unity in Kevadia on Saturday."

He also said there was “crisis of confidence” in the country and even Congress’ allies were disenchanted and wanted to quit UPA.

“The government in Delhi wants to stop our march to power. They have fielded the CBI to threaten us. CBI can silence Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati but not me,” he told BJP supporters at the airport here.

“They (the Centre) have been trying to instill fear of CBI (in me) every now and then. I will never be cowed down by CBI,IB,RAW or any agency in the world,” the Gujarat Chief Minister said amid chants of “Modi! Modi!”.

Later,addressing a gathering at Bharat Diamond Bourse,he trashed the Congress-led UPA government as the “most ineffective” in the country’s history with control over “only the CBI and tax department”.
“The government has lost control over everything. The only area it has control over is CBI and to some extent Income Tax department,” Modi who was weighed against silver at the function said.
“Tonight they will watch video of this event. Who shook hands with me,who garlanded me…they will be on Income Tax department’s radar. Does a government function with such vendetta? But Modi is made of different stuff. I am made of the soil from which Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi were made,” he said.
“There is a crisis of confidence in the country. Nobody trusts anybody. There are several partners in the UPA including one from Maharashtra. Ask them are they happy and they will tell you in private they are not. They are only thinking when to quit,how to quit,” he said.
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gopinath Munde were present at the function but only Modi spoke. 
“Our Prime Minister met Nawaz Sharif in America on Sunday. Later,at the Government of India’s press conference,words reflecting his courage and spirit were served to the nation. Do you trust these words?” Modi asked as the crowd responded with a resounding “No”.
Though the function was meant for inauguration of Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association’s “Diamond Hall” and supposed to be attended by traders,the event had the mood of a political rally with continual chants of “Modi! Modi!” from the gathering.
Modi said,”There is an unprecedented crisis of confidence. A mother does not know if her daughter will reach home safely…a father is unsure if his son will be able to lead a good life despite studying hard.”
Referring to the nuclear test during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure,he said,”That one confidence-filled decision made the world sit up and take notice. India’s voice began being heard,nation felt a new confidence.”
“Today,the government in Delhi has failed to keep the contry with it. Never a politician has been criticised as much as me but people never abandoned me. Did I fulfil all their wishes? No,there must have been shortcomings,but people never doubted my intentions,” he said.
Modi,who has faced criticism for the 2002 Gujarat riots,said,”The character of politics has changed but some leaders are still living in 1970s and 1980s. They don’t realise that the youth will not ingest the poison of casteism and communalism any more. They understand only one language,the language of development.”
Referring to the proposed “Statue of Unity” of Sardar Patel near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on Narmada river,Modi,considered a polarising figure,said,”It will serve as a symbol of national unity.”
“I have asked BJP workers to collect iron from tools of farmers from across the country as I want to emotionally unite the nation,” he said."

The sum of this experience, at 70, “enables us rightly to understand the true meaning and connection of the text with its moral and its beauties” — it gives us the panoramic view from the peak.
This is an important perspective. Prime Minister Narendra Modi turns 70 on Thursday, at a time when the rate of change, bringing both risks and opportunities, seems to be accelerating on all fronts. His simple, straightforward style is well known. His memory — for facts large and small — is legendary. This is equally true of his acuity in filtering through the noise with his legendary capabilities for implementation while micromanaging to a fault, of which examples are many — the Narmada Project pumping water against gravity to bring relief to the water-starved parts of Kutch; and, equally, the construction of the iconic Statue of Unity.
Yet, it is also clear that this 70 is no time for him to rest and assume that the hard-won understanding of the present will enable wisdom for navigating the future — the pinnacle on the horizon. “Those who stare at the past have their backs to the future,” it is said. Our complex world has forks in the road, not just oscillations around a stable centre. Change is non-linear. Interconnectedness — and interdependency — is a fact of life. The next pinnacle will thus be different from previous peaks.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Prime Minister Modi has demonstrated his capacity for strategic, forward-looking vision on multiple occasions over the years. The Swachh Bharat Mission and Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, for example, took a creative and strategic approach to improving our nation’s health and productivity by directly addressing issues such as ODF and sanitary pads. With his continuing belief in fiscal rectitude, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code were introduced to tackle the two challenging frontiers of the banking system — extending access to financial services and shoring up the foundations of bank solvency.
Looking forward, Prime Minister Modi is conscious of the need to navigate three new, unfolding, complex realities — rapid environmental change; shifting power dynamics between regions, actors, individuals and sectors; and the digital revolution from the Fourth Industrial Revolution to the opening up of new realms of intelligence. The earth that we once thought of as beyond our influence is now very clearly on the new trajectory of the Anthropocene. This has implications for temperature, rainfall, food and water security and biodiversity among others. The rapid pace at which we are now able to analyse and influence myriad aspects of society, environment, economy, infrastructure and even individual lives has offered a glimpse of the powers that we can use to rise to the occasion. Modi is committed to harnessing the digital revolution in a comprehensive sense and to build greater collective security. And how do we adjust to a new world where cybersecurity threats can arise from literally anywhere? These two trends are unfolding within, and influencing, a time of great change in the relationships that structure and reshape our collaboration. Modi’s belief in the PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) Platform is part of these endeavours.
At the risk of presenting a birthday request rather than a birthday felicitation, what are the ways in which he can truly use the perspective of his 70s in the decades toward 80 and beyond? He will recognise the need for three qualities in leadership in the coming years. One, the ability to remember the past, but see the present very clearly. We are entering a delicate era of shifting geopolitical sands. Our past alliances and interactions matter — friends are friends — but navigating new partnerships and initiatives that help us tackle emerging global challenges will require clear-eyed vision. This is true in internal matters as much as external affairs: We need new forms of collaborative partnership between the Centre, the states, and local governments.
A leader of his stature knows how to work within the constraints of reality — fiscal, chemical or biological—and, at the same time, inspire others to unite in making the best of the hard choices that these constraints dictate. We are on the edge of one of the greatest economic upheavals that the world has seen in recent memory, as COVID-19 and our efforts to halt the pandemic have accelerated existing trends to the point of discomfort and exposed hidden vulnerabilities. Prime Minister Modi cannot wish this reality away, and must build support for an innovative strategy that can mirror the hopes and wishes of his countrymen.
Finally, we need a visionary with the energy and freshness of perspective to forge ahead in a world that is offering both opportunities and risks. The Prime Minister will be the first to recognise that, in hindsight, joy, beauty, and common humanity are at the foundation of all that we have tried to do as a nation over the centuries. The horizon lies ahead.
Happy Birthday!

Modi, who was accompanied by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Governor Acharya Devvrat, rode the train and indulged in games at the Children’s Nutrition Park, cruised in a jetty along the six-kilometre navigation channel downstream Narmada River and petted animals and birds at the Sardar Patel Kevadia Zoological Park — projects that were slated for inauguration on March 26 but were postponed due to the Covid outbreak.
October 31, which is Sardar Patel’s birthday, is being celebrated as Ekta Divas and the projects in the precincts of the statue now called the “Kevadia tourism circuit” have been themed around “unity”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Scheduled to visit Kevadia Friday afternoon, Modi advanced his tour and arrived early to meet the families of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel who died Thursday and the Gujarati singer-actor duo Mahesh Kanodia and brother Naresh who died of Covid-19 earlier in the week.
Modi began his Kevadia visit by inaugurating the Aarogyavan, which has over 1,000 species of medicinal and herbal plantations, including a lotus-shaped indoor plants pavillion, and took a tour of the gardens on a golf cart with a face mask on, except at a couple of “selfie points”, where he stopped to take pictures.

The PM interacted with the women’s self-help groups from 331 families that will run the Aarogya Cafe — a health cafeteria where tourists will be able to purchase herbal items sourced mainly from the rich forests and villages around the Statue of Unity.
Modi, who spent close to an hour at each of the projects, rode the train at the Children’s Nutrition Park, running along a 600-metre track and five themed station stoppages —Phalshaka Griham, Payonagari, Annapoorna, Poshan Puram and Swastha Bharatam, featuring cuisines from across India. Each of the stations has a mascot — Kumar Kisan, a puppet farmer who tells the story of how he grows fruits and vegetables at Phalshakha, an animated cow grazer Janardhan at Payonagri, who explains the importance of milk and a doting mother at Annapoorna station.
Modi also watched a five-minute 5D movie on India’s “unity in food diversity”. He also inaugurated the two-storeyed Ekta Mall, spread over 35,000 sq ft that houses handicrafts and handlooms from across the country.

At the Jungle Safari, touted as the “fastest-built safari in the world”, and the geodesic dome for aviary, “the largest in the world”, Modi spent time petting a macaw and went on the cruise downstream the Narmada river.
Among the projects was the SoU website in UN languages, Glow Garden and the Special Lighting at the Narmada Dam. The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone for the government quarters and an administrative building coming up in the vicinity following the implementation of the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority. The Gujarat assembly, had last year passed a bill to set up a Statue of Unity Tourism Authority which will notify a designated tourism development area around the SoU.
He also laid the foundation stone for quarters of the State Reserve Police Force as well as the Adarsh Gam, which has been proposed by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) to relocate close to 1,000 beneficiaries of the six villages around the Statue of Unity, who have been agitating against the acquisition of their lands.
On Saturday, Modi will inaugurate the water aerodrome project connecting Statue of Unity to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad by taking the seaplane ride back to Ahmedabad after addressing the trainee officers of Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) from the exhibition hall of the Statue of Unity via live video-conferencing.

A pre-Covid study carried out by the Institute of Competitiveness has projected this figure to further increase to 40 lakh in 2020, 53.6 lakhs in 2021 and 68.6 lakh in 2022, as per a report of the SSNNL.
As per the NSSO Tourism Survey 2017 report, the average expenditure per tourist for a holiday trip in India is Rs 1,445. At this rate, integrated development of Kevadia is expected to create a direct economic impact of Rs 2,861.68 crore during 2020-2022 and an indirect impact of Rs. 6,127.14 crore considering output multiplier of 2.1411. The study has concluded that “Kevadia Eco-system will generate a cumulative economic impact (direct and indirect combined) of around Rs 9,000 crore (2020-2022),” the report states."

Speaking at the state BJP headquarters,Modi asked partymen not to ridicule or belittle the vanquished Opposition in the aftermath of polls irrespective of whatever they do to me…I will deal with them in my own way.
The CM said the results proved the people had voted for security,peace and development and not for false propaganda despite scary predictions by naysayers. I may not have a place in the media space but I am certainly ensconced in the hearts of my people.. I will win over the media also in the coming days with sheer love and affection because we want to serve this nation, he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Pledging to serve people with more vigour,he said the victory also meant greater responsibility of rising to expectations of voters and fulfilling their aspirations. Speaking in Hindi,he said he chose the language to emphasis the nationwide significance of the victory.
The BJPs journey of victory began from Chotila via Kathlal to Ahmedabad and will go on to local body elections,Modi said,adding the BJP in Gujarat never accepted the politics of negativity and that healthy criticism was acceptable but not allegations. That is why,he said,those undermining constitutional institutions and misusing them did not win. 
Without naming the Congress,he said people were teaching them lesson after lesson but they were just refusing to learn.
Mentioning his controversial announcement about Statue of Unity,he said the people had a sixth sense with which they would spot the real intent behind what was being said. In this context,he said the Oppositions advertisement about ten-headed demon had backfired on them. We dont release advertisements but simply address public meetings, he said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

MAHARASHTRA

Mumbai

Governor C Vidyasagar Rao flagged off the Run for Unity, in which Chief Minister designate Devendra Fadnavis and union ministers Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal and Raosaheb Danve participated. IIT Bombay screened a documentary on Patel, organised a drawing competition and a run on campus. At Mumbai University, 1,200 students took a national unity pledge. At a sombre affair at the Congress office at Azad Maidan, Mumbai Congress chief Janardan Chandurkar paid tributes to both Indira and Patel.
Pune

National Unity Day celebrations overshadowed Indira’s death anniversary. Run for Unity was flagged off at all government offices, schools and colleges. Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation — ruled by NCP-Congress and Congress respectively — observed both, but the ‘unity’ celebration was more exuberant. Pune University organised several ‘unity’ functions. The Pune Congress observed a formal Indira Gandhi Jayanti event at Congress Bhavan; the city BJP unit organised the Run for Unity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
GUJARAT

Chief Minister Anandiben Patel presided over the flagging of the Run For Unity, inaugurated the renovated government primary school at the Sardar’s birthplace, Karamsad, and laid the foundation for the Shrestha Bharat Bhavan at Kevadiya Colony, which is a part of the Statue Of Unity project. The government issued advertisments in newspapers, and the CM blogged and tweeted about the Sardar. Homage to Indira was confined to the Congress party and headquarters, and social media on which party leaders posted tributes.
RAJASTHAN

The government issued newspaper ads on Patel, the Congress on Indira. The Congress observed both events in its district and block units, and at the party head office in the state capital. The BJP Yuva Morcha organized the Run for Unity across the state. Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje administered the ‘unity’ oath to schoolchildren.
PUNJAB

At the Congress head office, leaders gathered to mark “Sankalp Diwas”. The state BJP did not organise any function at its headquarters, but leaders and workers gathered for the Run for Unity in district offices. No function was organised by the SAD. Government offices organised the ‘unity’ pledge and government schools ‘unity’ runs.
KARNATAKA

The Congress government organised separate functions for Patel and Indira. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was present for both the events, at the Vidhana Soudha and the Congress office respectively. At the Unity Day event, he and other officials took the ‘unity’, and the government organised the ‘national unity’ run.
UTTAR PRADESH

The BJP organised Run for Unity programmes; in Lucknow, union minister Uma Bharti participated. The UPCC held a shradhanjali sabha as well as a programme to observe Sardar Patel jayanti at the state party office.
HIMACHAL PRADESH

CM Virbhadra Singh led the tribute to Indira at Ridge maidan in Shimla. He also administered the ‘unity’ oath to officials present at the event. Not much happened at BJP offices.
BIHAR

The Bihar Congress organised functions at its office for both Patel and Indira, which, however, were not attended by the party’s top leaders. BJP leaders Ramkripal Yadav and C P Thakur attended the Run for Unity in Patna. The BJP organised a function at its office to pay tributes to Patel.
HARYANA

CM Manohar Lal Khattar led the Run for Unity and administered the ‘unity’ oath to secretariat staff before leaving for Mumbai. Similar programmes were organised at the district level. The Congress office was quiet, with no senior leaders visiting."

Progress at the Statue of Unity, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has revealed a rather disquieting truth. The construction contract for what would be the world’s tallest statue may have gone to Larsen & Toubro (L&T), but it has sub-contracted the crucial work of bronze cladding to Jiangxi Toqine, a Chinese firm. Even the steel framework for the statue is being procured from China. While L&T’s decision may be prompted by economic rationale, the sheer disconnect with the manner in which the statue was promoted — as a symbol of national pride within the Make in India framework — may seem a disappointment. That sentiment is, however, misplaced. While Make in India may be a laudable objective, the right way to go about it would be to take a cue from what RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had to say on Monday. Rajan’s central message was that Make in India should not be about the government micro-managing specific sectors and industries, but focusing on creating an enabling environment that makes the country a natural choice for manufacturers, both global and domestic.
“Let’s create the frameworks, let’s make the business easier, let’s make taxation more transparent, more predictable and let’s do all the things necessary to allow our businesses to create what is needed,” Rajan said. This is not the first time he has said it. Last December, Rajan sought to distinguish between “Make in India” and “Make for India” and argued that in a global downturn, the latter is a better choice. This is because Make in India could easily fall into the trap of extending sops to exporters or import substitution through high tariff barriers, which, in turn, reward inefficiency and hurt consumer interest.
If India is to be an efficient manufacturer, it has to follow the basic principle of competitive advantage. That can happen if the government focuses on the ease of doing business and helps lower transaction costs through better policy, regulation and infrastructure provisioning ."

Pradhan also praised the effort of Modi for organising such an event to pay tribute to Patel. 
When inquired,BSP state president Ram Achal Rajbhar said party chief Mayawati may initiate action in this matter on Monday when she meets senior party leaders in Delhi. Rajbhar said that it was not appropriate for the BSP MLC to attend the event. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pradhan along with over half-a-dozen supporters reached near the Patel statue in Hazratganj and participated in the run,which was finished at Shaheed Smarak. Pradhans presence in the event was surprising for the gathering,but not for BJP leaders who claim that the BSP MLC is planning to join the saffron party.  
Talking to The Indian Express,Pradhan said,Run for Unity was not an event of BJP only. It was organised for the cause of unity and integrity of the nation. I participated in the run as it was for paying tribute to Sardar Patel who united several provinces to make one nation.
Pradhan also said that everyone should praise the efforts of Modi who did a noble work by organising the event. 
While Pradhan denied plans to join BJP,sources said that his wife Anita Pradhan is making efforts to get BJP ticket for Unnao Lok Sabha constituency,where BSP has already fielded partys Rajya Sabha member Brijesh Pathak. 
Hoardings as well as billboards of Anita Pradhan with photographs of Modi were erected in Unnao district ahead of Gujarat CMs Kanpur rally on October 19. The message on the hoardings and billboards was Modi lana hai,desh bachana hai.
Pradhan too had met BJP national general secretary Amit Shah and state president Laxmikant Bajpai at partys state headquarters in Lucknow on October 4.

Express
Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi on Thursday announced that the target to complete the rail line between Vadodara and the Statue of Unity in Kevadia has been brought forward from the December 2020 deadline to October 31, 2020.
“Initially we had proposed to complete the rail line and commence the rail services to Kevadia and Statue of Unity by the end of December next year. But after a thorough inspection today, I have set a target to complete it by October 31 next year on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” Angadi said.
The rail line connecting Vadodara to Kevadia Colony would cover a distance of 78 km in total, of which a new rail line between Dabhoi and Chandod (18 km) and between Chandod and Kevadia Colony (32 km) is to be laid down. So far, 14 km of the 18 km stretch between Dabhoi and Chandod has been completed. Of the 18 km stretch, the government is yet to acquire 26.5 hectare of land which corresponds to approximately 4 kms of rail line.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“The Railways is facing problems in acquiring land…for the 4 km stretch. I have urged the state government and the district administration to meet the private parties who own the land, discuss their issues and expedite the process,” Angadi said. “Once the land has been acquired, the Railways is all set to complete the rail line and the line will be ready in the next three months.”
For the stretch between Chandod and Kevadia, which is a 32-km stretch of new rail line, 80 hectare of land including government land has been acquired, whereas 97 hectare of land is yet to be acquired. “On the stretch between Chandod and Kevadia, work is underway for the railway station at Kevadia as well two bridges connecting them, all of which fall under government land. However, the private land is yet to be acquired,” Angadi added.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The 40-day lockdown was further extended at a time of sporadic expressions of resistance and anger by migrant workers in a few cities. Extreme precarity doesn’t have a singular expression. While some are responding with anger, others are responding with resignation. The severe distress among migrant workers in India is not entirely by chance. It has been marinating for a while but the epic new scale has been manufactured due to the unplanned and unilateral decision of a lockdown taken by the prime minister.
The arbitrariness and unpreparedness are evident from the confusing messages from the central government concerning transport for migrants. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order on April 29 permitting inter-state travel for workers who want to return home and instructed the states to appoint nodal officers to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Thereafter the MHA issued another order on May 1 stating that “passenger movement by trains, except for security purposes or for purposes as permitted by MHA” was to be prohibited. This was followed by another order on May 3, which stated: “it is clarified that the MHA orders are meant to facilitate movement of stranded persons who had moved from their native places/ workplaces, just before the lockdown period…” Through these orders, the MHA has taken refuge in obfuscation.
Notwithstanding the confusing orders, the constant shuffling of travel modes and costs further expose the central government’s lack of empathy, thought and planning. We present a highly generous estimate for the total travel cost by trains. If all of 6.5 crore inter-state migrants (Ravi Srivastava’s estimate of the number of migrants) were to return, and assuming an average ticket fare of Rs 650, the total travel cost comes to around Rs 4,200 crore. To put this number in perspective, the cost of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat is reportedly Rs 3,000 crore. The PM-Cares as per news reports from early April had Rs 6,500 crore.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The migrant worker distress has also exposed the inherent fractures of the “one nation” narrative that is one of the unique selling propositions of the BJP government. While it goes against the grain of the idea of India that has a rich tradition of pluralism, it is also meaningless from a governance standpoint.
Migrant workers don’t carry their ration cards and so haven’t been able to avail of government rations in the states where they are stranded. The employers, contractors mostly, have largely abandoned them without paying them wages. Consequently, they are left to scrounge for food and are left without money. In many cases, they are stranded without knowing the local language. In this situation, it is the poorer state governments of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, etc. that have attempted to seek out “their people” stranded in richer states such as Maharashtra or Haryana and make cash transfers to their account. The economies of these richer states have benefited from the labour of migrants from the poorer states. However, the richer states have neither extended any financial support nor forced employers to pay wages to the workers. Worse still, on May 5, Chief Minister of Karnataka, B S Yediyurappa, cancelled trains for migrant workers from Bengaluru to their home states. The decision was taken after a meeting between the chief minister and the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI). Neither migrant workers nor trade unions representing them were consulted. This was not only insensitive but a violation of the right to live with dignity (Article 21), right to freedom of movement (Article 19) and prohibition of forced labour (Article 23). The government decided to restore the train services only after protests.
Barring examples from Kerala and Telangana, most host states have demonstrated disregard for migrant workers. It behooves the host states to care about the migrant workers not only from a humanitarian standpoint but also from the perspective of the health of the economy.
On its part, the central government has maintained a calibrated silence regarding this. Monopolising decisions and socialising losses are not what federalism is supposed to mean. Therefore, it is time that the poorer states realise that the unilateral lockdown is not just an assault on the dignity of the poor, but also an economic assault on the poorer state governments. Further, there has been a concerted effort by the central government and some host states to hold the labour captive in the richer states by making transportation procedures unreasonable.
A report by the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN) showed that only 6 per cent of the daily wage migrant workers had been paid their full wages during the lockdown and 99 per cent of the self-employed had not earned any income. SWAN, a group of over 100 volunteers who respond to distress calls of the stranded from all over the country, has released two reports. The latest report, released on Labour Day (May 1), focuses on the second phase of lockdown, between April 14 and April 27. The report is not based on a survey but is a compendium of around 17,000 worker testimonies (1,500 labour groups) through which some broad statistics have been calculated.
A petition concerning wages for stranded workers during the lockdown period was being heard in the Supreme Court but was summarily disposed of on April 21. Referring to the plight of migrant workers, the Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, responding on behalf of the Government of India (GoI) said, “Who told Mr Bhushan that no one is getting anything? There are direct benefit transfer schemes.” Further, referring to the Rs 500 per month transfer to women Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY) account holders, the Principal Economic Advisor, Sanjeev Sanyal recently said: “Of course, we are not going to solve poverty by giving Rs 500… But we are just cushioning the hit so that everyone has some money and some food.”
Distress statistics from SWAN’s report paints a contrary picture. From the 259 persons (out of more than 10,000 workers for whom we have this data) who have availed of cash transfer from governments, only 20 of them received Rs 500 in their JDY accounts. Half of all those who reached out have less than one day of rations left. Around two-thirds have less than Rs 100 left. As one of the traumatised workers said, “I have a one-year-old daughter and a mentally depressed husband. I need to buy medicines for them but I don’t have any cash.”
Besides, do we need the veil of statistics to state the obvious? Don’t we already know that construction workers, domestic workers, sex workers, the homeless, street vendors, and other such people live precarious lives without any safety nets? Let alone an economic lockdown, they lose access to daily wages if they fall sick for even a day. To paraphrase Bob Dylan, Do we need a weatherman to tell us which way the wind blows?

While Congress would get the posts of district panchayat president, JD(U) would name V-Ps. Congress had won 10 of the 22 seats in Narmada and JD(U) secured six seats. According to JD(U) leaders, the party opted for Congress after a meeting between Congress leader Ahmed Patel, JD(U) president Sharad Yadav and its Gujarat leader Chhotu Vasava in Delhi last week. To form Narmada district panchayat board, a party or a coalition needs at least 12 seats.
In the previous term, Narmada district panchayat was entirely under BJP, while the saffron was in coalition with JD(U) in Bharuch. One of the reasons for JD(U) tying up with Congress in Narmada is the ongoing work on the Statue of Unity. “We have agreed to share the seats in Narmada and Bharuch with Congress as the tie up with BJP had left us completely disillusioned. We have decided that Congress will keep the posts of the president and we will retain V-P posts. The Bhilistan issue (demand for a separate tribal state) has been discussed as it is important for us,” said Vasava.
The parties are likely to hand over mandate to four candidates Tuesday. While Congress has decided to field Prafful Patel for the post of Narmada panchayat president, JD(U) has chosen Vanita Vasava for V-P. In Bharuch, Congress will field Rajendrasinh Ranna for president while Anil Bhagat of JD(U) would be in line for V-P. BJP is likely to field its candidates Tuesday to stop the Congress-JDU combine from capturing the posts uncontested.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
JD(U)’s Anil Bhagat said, “We broke relations with BJP keeping in mind the two big projects of state government like Dediap-ada in Narmada, which has been declared an eco-sensitive zone, due to which over 120 villages will be affected, and the Statue of Unity project at Kevadia to develop tourism. In both projects, large number of tribals are likely to be displaced. Besides, the quality of treatment at primary health care centre and civil hospital is also not good.”"

It was earlier called Sardar Patel Stadium.
Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel rebutted the allegations saying that the Congress was unnecessarily spreading rumours.
Gujarat Congress leaders, including state president Amit Chavda and working president Hardik Patel, criticised the alleged renaming of the stadium and added that people of Gujarat will not tolerate such attempts by BJP to erase Sardar Patel from history.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chavda took to Twitter and said, “In the times of Congress, Ahmedabad cricket stadium’s name was clubbed with the name of Sardar Saheb which is now being changed to Narendra Modi Stadium and Gujarat will not tolerate such ‘gustakhi’. This is insult not only of Sardar Saheb, but also of Gujarat. In the arrogance of power, BJP people are trying to erase the history.”
Hardik Patel tweeted, “Name of Ahmedabad-based world’s biggest, Sardar Patel Cricket Stadium, has been changed to Narendra Modi Stadium. Is it not an insult of Sardar Patel? The BJP which seeks vote in the name of Sardar Patel is now insulting Sardar Saheb. People of Gujarat will not tolerate insult of Sardar Patel.”

In another tweet, Hardik wrote, “Bharat Ratna Sardar Patel had imposed a ban on RSS (Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh). And therefore, RSS followers are making every possible attempt to delete his name (from history). External friendship, but enmity within, that is the conduct of BJP towards Sardar Patel. Remember one thing, Hindustan will not tolerate insult of Sardar Patel.”
Strongly refuting the Congress allegations, Deputy CM Nitin Patel said that the Motera Stadium has now been named as Narendra Modi Stadium and that a stadium by the name of Sardar Patel is still there in Naranpura area of Ahmedabad.
Patel said, “Today is a day of pride for the country. It is world’s biggest stadium… This cricket stadium has been built by GCA which was till now known as Motera Stadium… That stadium has been named as Narendrabhai Modi Cricket Stadium by GCA today.”
Patel said that union Home Minister Amit Shah has played an important role in demolition of old stadium at Motera and building this huge stadium with all modern facilities.
“Leaders of Congress, without any research, without any understanding, are looking at this historic moment with criticism when Sardar Vallabhbhai Sports Complex is being built where youth of Gujarat and entire country will get Olympic level, Asiad level, Commonwealth level training/coaching… Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s name is clubbed with that complex and it is being criticised. World’s biggest cricket stadium is being clubbed with Narendra Modiji and it is also being criticised,” Patel said.
Patel said that Sardar Patel Stadium in Naranpura area of Ahmedabad is owned by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, adding that the GCA had built a stadium in Motera. Modi, when he was GCA president, decided to demolish it and to build an international level stadium.
“Today, the work has been completed, President has dedicated the same (stadium) and the first test between England and India has begun…. It is unfair that Congressmen are unsuccessfully and unnecessarily trying to spread rumours… I want to tell them, you may get it researched, Motera Stadium was known as Motera Stadium only in the past… And Sardar Patel Stadium is owned by AMC… It does not have capacity/facilities to hold international matches…,” Patel said adding that its name was changed to honour the unique personality of Narendra Modi.
For the development of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Sports Complex, Patel added, union sports ministry has made provision of Rs 250 crore in this year’s budget. “So, the (Narendra Modi) stadium will come under the umbrella of Sardar Vallabhbhai Sports Complex,” Patel said.
Alleging that the Congress has only given credit to Nehru-Gandhi family, while doing injustice to a number of national leaders, including Sardar Patel, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, Subhash Chandra Bose, Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh, Patel said the BJP has made the world’s tallest statue — the Statue of Unity — in Kevadia to honour Sardar Patel."

Social activist Rohit Prajapati,who was part of the October 3 protest,organised at Indravarna village in Narmadas Nandod taluka,said the government had finally woken up to the demands of the villagers and taken them seriously. Now they want to discuss the issues with the villagers because they have understood that the protest was serious, he said.

The grandnephew of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel said the 182-metre-high Statue of Unity was a tribute long overdue, but added that Patel would have said no to such a tribute.
“If we had asked him (Sardar Patel) if he wanted a statue in his name, he would have said no. He grew up in a humble background. He understood the value of money,” said Dhirubhai Patel, the 91-year-old grandnephew of Sardar Patel, who along with 36 other members of his family attended the unveiling of the Statue of Unity on Wednesday.

“We are happy that he has finally got his due… He was a man of vision and conviction. He would walk everyday from Karamsad to Nadiad to attend school. Had he spent some more time with Subhas Chandra Bose, he was bound to have reached even greater heights,” Dhirubhai said.

Sardar Patel’s great grandniece and Dhirubhai’s daughter, 62-year-old Malini Patel, said, “Compared to what he (Sardar Patel) did for the country, and to what he represents, this figure (the statue) is nothing. He was my first hero and in true sense he is the real father of the nation.

It is a good move by the Gujarat government to negotiate with them after realising the gravity of the issue, Lakhanbhai Musafir of 70 Gam Adivasi Sangthan,an organisation of 70 tribal villages,said here on Wednesday.
This move comes in the wake of the Gujarat government deciding to go ahead with the foundation stone laying ceremony of the 182-metre-high statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31  by Chief Minister Narendra Modi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
About 145 tribal representatives held talks with three senior ministers,including Revenue minister Anandiben Patel and Finance minister Nitin Patel,as well as Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limiteds (SSNL) managing director,Musafir added. They demanded removal of 70 villages from the list of the Kevadiya Area Development Authority and the extension of rehabilitation benefits given to project affected people and irrigation benefits of Sardar Sarovar dam as well as Karjan river dam to the 70 villages.
Tribals from 70 villages had organised a huge rally on October 2 where they resolved not to part with their land to the KADA project.
Musafir said that 68 village headmen refused to give their consent for acquisition of land saying that the did not want any development at the cost of their livelihood.
Tribals told ministers that people of six villages evicted from the site of the Sardar Sarovar Dam on April 5,1961,continue to be deprived of rehabilitation benefits.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Twitter
A group of residents of Karamsad in Anand district ended their indefinite fast on Wednesday after state BJP president Jitu Vaghani assured them that their demand for “national status” to the town will be looked into by the BJP governments at the state and the Centre.
Members of Sardar Hitrakshak Samiti had started the indefinite fast on April 30, seeking special status for the town where India’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had received his early education. On Wednesday, Vaghani met the fasting protesters at Karamsad town and assured them that the state government would push for a “national status” to the town, thus convincing residents to end their protest and fast.
Vaghani visited Karamsad after the residents of the town refused to back off, continuing their fast for a third day on Wednesday. The residents are demanding that the Centre must grant town status of a national village as a mark of respect for Patel, like Porbandar which has been declared a place of national importance as it is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ramesh Patel, one of the members of the Samiti, said, “For several years, this demand has been pending. In 1995, when Porbandar was accorded national status, it made the place prominent. There was a simultaneous proposal for Karamsad too. But it was ignored. Over the years, with different governments in power and different political ideologies at play, everyone has utilised the the name of Sardar Patel for their benefits but not respected him as much as he should have been respected.”
The Samiti members claimed that they had personally made a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016 demanding national status for the town, but nothing has been done so far, forcing them to call a bandh on May 1, which is also celebrated as Gujarat Foundation Day. After convincing the residents to end their fast, Vaghani said that the issue should “not be politicised”, but did not refrain from criticising the Congress.
“Sardar Patel’s contribution to India and his legacy are invaluable. We understand the feelings of the residents of Karamsad, who have been sitting on fast. I have come here to assure them that the BJP government has the same feelings of respect for Sardar Patel. The state government and the Central Government will look into this demand.”
Without naming the Congress, Vaghani accused the Opposition of disrespecting Patel. “The entire country knows who does not respect Sardar Patel’s legacy. Why was he not given the Bharat Ratna for several years? How many schemes in their (Congress) tenure were named after Sardar Saab and how many are in his name now is for everyone to see. Everyone also knows who was opposing the idea of the Statue of Unity, which has been Modiji’s dream and a fitting tribute to the legacy of Sardar Patel.”"

The Gujarat government Thursday directed district collectors and municipal commissioners across the state to ensure that all schools and colleges across the state install replicas of the Statue of Unity, given to them during the Ekta Yatras ahead of the unveiling of the statue in October, in their premises by December 15.
The directive by additional chief secretary (home) Anand Mohan Tiwari also states that local MPs and MLAs should be invited to the installation events on December 15, the day Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel died in 1950.
The state government had, in October, taken out Ekta Yatras across the state ahead of the unveiling of the 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Kevadiya Colony of Narmada district. During these rallies, the government had distributed replicas of the statue to all schools and colleges.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While Tiwari could not be contacted for a comment, principal secretary Anju Sharma told The Indian Express that the objective for setting up these replicas at schools and colleges is to “inspire the future generations and inform them about the contributions and sacrifices made by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for nation building and integrating the 562 princely states into the Indian union”.
The circular, however, added that damaged replicas should not be installed without adequate repair.
The nodal officers of the Ekta Yatra have been instructed to review the state of the replicas. The replicas that have suffered major damage will not be installed."

Congress leader Karan Singh has written to Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath, seeking the construction of a statue for Sita in addition to the proposed Ram statue in Ayodhya, ANI reported.
The chief minister had finalised the details for the construction of a 221-metre long statue of Ram in Ayodhya last month. The structure will comprise a Ram statue of 151 m, an overhead umbrella of 20 m and a pedestal of 50 m.
In his letter, released by ANI on Twitter, Singh wrote, “Considering the unfortunate circumstances Sita faced, the thought occurred to me, if you have already decided to construct a Ram statue, I request you to half the height of the statue and construct two in its place — one for Ram and one for Sita.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Hindutva firebrand leader Yogi Adityanath had cleared the building of the Ram statue, days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on October 31, inaugurated the tallest statue in the world — The Statue of Unity, in a tribute to country’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhhai Patel-in Gujarat.
To keep up with the height of the Ram statue, the Maharashtra government said it may increase the height of the proposed Shivaji memorial statue to 230-meters."

The protesting villagers have said that theyll hold mass fasting on October 31 against the lack of clarity on governments stand on acquiring land for tourism purpose,which they said was not resolved just by nullifying the Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA).
People of affected villages will hold a hunger strike in a large number on October 31. Affected villages will also hoist Jagruti flags in their villages and will beat Jagruti Thali in the afternoon to prove that we are still awake on the issues on which they are fighting, a press release stated.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Social activist and Narmada dam rehabilitation champion Medha Patkar also visited Savli village in Narmadas Tilakwada taluka on Tuesday to attend the meeting of tribals from Narmada,who were displaced due to the dam. She lashed out at the Modi government for the Statue of Unity,saying that the government should first complete work on the Narmada canal network.
Sardar Patel was the iron man,but his heart was not that of iron. Talks of collection of iron from farmers remind of talks of bringing bricks for construction of temple in Ayodhya, she said,while addressing a gathering of more than 1,000 tribals. She said that the governments silence over persons getting displaced due to Garudeshwar Weir was against the constitutional and humanitarian rights of tribals living in the region.
The government had on Monday conveyed that most of the demands of the protesting tribals,including that of repelling of KADA and formation of Garudeshwar taluka,as well as special package to persons displaced from six villages due to Narmada dam some 52 years ago,will be met. 
The protesting tribals said that the government kept mum on one of the main demands made by them,that of stop construction of Garudeshwar Weir,situated some 12 kms downstream of the Narmada dam,had not been met.
People are not against KADA for the sake of it,but because it was taking away peoples land and livelihood for the purpose of tourism development.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday said the Sardar Sarovar dam and the Statue of Unity are living examples of how development and environment can thrive together.
Addressing a rally on the occasion of Namami Devi Narmade, celebrating the full reservoir level of the Sardar Sarovar dam at its raised height of 138.68 metres, Modi said: “In our culture, there is a belief that environment protection and development are both possible. Since morning today, I have visited a lot of places. At every place, I have seen amazing coordination between environment and development. On one side is the Sardar Sarovar dam and the hydropower turbines, and on the other side there is a cactus garden, a butterfly garden, eco-tourism and others,” he said.
That the Sardar Sarovar dam has reached its full reservoir limit (FRL), he said, is an achievement in itself because the level earlier was 122 metres. “This is a laudable achievement. And this will be the inspiration for the Jal Jeevan mission and promotion of movements for the success of water conservation in the country. The people’s movements in the state for water conservation are commendable and should be promoted at the national level too,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

(Express photo: Bhupendra Rana)
On the Statue of Unity and the footfall of more than 23 lakh tourists in the last 11 months, Modi said: “On an average, Statue of Unity sees a daily footfall of 8,500 tourists. Compare it with the Statue of Liberty which sees a footfall of 10,000 tourists every day. It is 133 years old. So a daily average of 8,500 tourists at Statue of Unity in just 11 months speaks volumes about its popularity. With new tourist attractions coming up in the area, not only will tourist numbers increase but so will employment opportunities for local residents.”
He recalled the time when the state used to have acute water shortage, and how women had to walk 5-10 km daily to fetch water. Families from Kutch and Saurashtra migrated to other cities, he said, adding that it was in 2000 when a special water train service was started to provide water to Jamnagar, Surendranagar and Bhavnagar.
The state, he said, had come a long way since. “When you trusted me with power, we had two major responsibilities. One to expedite work on the dam for irrigation and drinking water, and the second to expand the Narmada network canal. Till 2001, the main canal stretched only 150 km. Irrigation and drinking water facilities were incomplete. But today, in the last 17-18 years, almost twice the land has been brought under irrigation. Area under drip irrigation and micro irrigation was only 14,000 hectare and only 8,000 agricultural families could benefit from it. Today, the area covered is 19 lakh hectare and around 12 lakh families benefit.”
He cited an IIM study which concluded that micro and drip irrigation had led to 50% water conservation, 25% reduction in use of fertilizer, 40% reduction in labour cost and 30% increase in crop produce which eventually led to an increase of Rs 15,500 in the per hectare income of each family in Gujarat.
Reiterating the government’s goal to provide tap water to every household, Modi said, “Not only irrigation, tap water provision to every household has also substantially increased. In 2001, only 26% households had tap water availability in Gujarat. Today, 78% households have tap water facility. Taking inspiration from here, we have to achieve similar accessibility of tap water across the country.”
After he reached Kevadia in the morning, Modi visited tourist attraction spots developed around the Statue of Unity including the cactus garden, the butterfly garden, safari park, Vishwa Van and Ekta nursery which were also formally inaugurated Tuesday. He released butterflies and named the saffron-coloured tiger butterfly as the state butterfly. He performed the Narmada aarti before addressing the rally. In the afternoon, Modi met his mother Hiraba over lunch in Raysan, Gandhinagar, where she lives with her younger son Pankaj.

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock)
Rashtriya Ekta Diwas 2019 (National Unity Day): The ‘Rashtriya Ekta Diwas’ or the National Unity Day is celebrated on October 31, which is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — an Indian politician who played an instrumental role in India’s struggle for independence, and later during the integration of the country.
In 2014, when a new government formed at the Centre, it was decided that October 31 be celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas — an announcement that was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Announcing the observance, the Ministry of Home Affairs had said in a press release that the “occasion will provide an opportunity to reaffirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity, and security of our country.”
At the time of independence, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a key role in convincing several princely states to align with the Indian Union. The day of his birth, therefore, celebrates his efforts and contributions.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Last year, the government unveiled the ‘Statue of Unity’, sculpted in his honour, in the state of Gujarat. The colossal statue of the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India stands at a height of 182 metres and is the tallest in the world.
On this day, many schools and offices organise programmes that promote national integration among the citizens of the country."

A construction labourer working at the site of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat fell to his death on Friday, sparking off a protest by the labourers, briefly disrupting the work, on Saturday. The labourers demanded compensation for the family of the deceased worker from the company contracted for the project — L&T. They also wanted to take the custody of the worker’s body. After the intervention of L&T officials, the labourers resumed their work, following assurances from the company officials.
The incident occurred on Friday when Mehendi Rasool Siddiqui, a 45-year-old labourer from Jharkhand, plunged to his death by falling off an under-construction bridge that is part of the facelift that Kevadia Colony in Narmada district is to get for the Statue of Unity project. Siddiqui was working on the construction of the bridge that is part of the four-lane approach road to the Statue of Unity. According to Kevadia Colony police, Siddiqui was unwell and dizzy and slipped from a height while working at the site.
He was rushed to a hospital in Vadodara for treatment, but succumbed to his injuries. When Siddiqui’s body did not return to Kevadia colony on Saturday, workers protested and stalled the construction, demanding that the body should be handed over to them. However, L&T officials intervened to tackle the situation and offered to arrange a bus for some workers to visit Vadodara where the body had been kept.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official said, “The workers were reassured that the body was being sent back to his village in Jharkhand where his family could perform his last rites. The workers were mourning the loss of one of their own and it did not hamper the work. Most workers returned to the sites while some visited Vadodara. They also took an undertaking that the deceased labourer’s family will be given a decent compensation.”

To mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 69th birthday, a man donated a gold crown weighing 1.25 kg to Sankat Mochan Temple in Varanasi, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday.
Arvind Singh said he had taken a pledge to offer the gold crown to Lord Hanuman if PM Modi returns to power for a second term. “Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, I took a vow to offer gold crown weighing 1.25 kg to Lord Hanuman if Modi ji formed the government for the second time,” he told ANI.
A priest at the temple said, “He (PM Modi) is the one who is building the nation in a way that was not done in the last 75 years. So it was decided that this crown would be offered to Lord Hanuman a day before his birthday with faith that Prime Minister Modi’s and India’s future would shine like gold. It is a gift for him on behalf of Kashi people.”
Born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar in Gujarat, the Prime Minister visited the Statue of Unity on his birthday and offered prayers at the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada in the state. He was welcomed by Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and CM Vijay Rupani at the airport late on Monday night. The BJP is celebrating Modi’s birthday as ‘Seva Saptah’ (week of service) from September 14 to September 20."

The Vadodara fire and rescue department on Friday retrieved the body of Trupti Parmar, the fifth member of the family that went missing after a visit to the Statue of Unity on March 1. Trupti’s body was found five kilometers away from where the family’s car and four bodies were pulled out from the minor canal in Shankarpura in Dabhoi on Thursday.
Police officials said that the probe into the mysterious drowning of the family is yet to conclude.
“We are investigating why the car went on to the mud path from the main road. Although we are assuming that the driver may have lost control of the car after it turned dark and slipped into the canal. The absence of a trace of struggle from the car on the dirt track makes us suspect that it could have been deliberately smoothly driven into the canal. If the driver had lost control there would have been some marks of the car swerving on this side for a certain distance before plunging into the canal. At the moment, however, we cannot conclusively say that it was a simple accident,” a senior official said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Thursday, the car was spotted by local residents. The bodies of Kalpesh Parmar, his mother Usha, and children Niyati and Atharva were found inside.
The family went missing under mysterious circumstances after visiting the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district. They were captured in a CCTV camera outside the Children’s Nutrition park on the evening of March 1 (Sunday). Police officers on Wednesday said the family was last spotted at Krishna Kathiyawadi hotel CCTV in Dabhoi, about 35 kilometers from Vadodara, after which their phones went untraceable.
The final rites of the four members found on Thursday took place late on Thursday night. The family will perform Trupti’s last rites today evening.
In their last conversation with their family, Kalpesh had informed his cousin that they were planning to meet a relative in Bharuch before returning to Vadodara. On Monday morning, when Kalpesh’s grandfather tried to contact him, his phone was switched off. He then called up their relative in Bharuch, who said Kalpesh never reached their place.
Kalpesh’s family members then reached Kevadia Colony and informed the police."

The sketch will be displayed prominently Jis se samanya aur gharib janata bhi farsh se arsh tak pahunchne ka prayas karegi (as it will inspire the ordinary and poor people to reach for the stars), said Laxmikant Bajpai,state BJP president.
Recently,Samajwadi Party general secretary Naresh Agarwal had targetted Modi saying that he cannot become a PM as someone rising from a tea shop can never have a national perspective.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The capability and ability of a person has nothing to do with his caste and creed. We want to give this message to the people, Bajpai said adding that Agarwal (Naresh) is a party-hopper who should speak cautiously as no one knows which party will come to power.
Bajpai said the exhibition will have several videos,paintings and sketches depicting Modis life journey. A one-and-a-half hour long animated video on Modis life will also be displayed.
The exhibition is being organised by the IT cell of the party. Vijay Bhadauria,IT cell in-charge for Agra city,said they have conceptualised a complete model for showing Modi selling tea at a railway platform. We will also have some chaiwallahs selling tea at nominal rates to give a message that essential commodities will be cheaper once Modiji becomes the PM, said Bhadauria.
A model of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels proposed statue of unity will also be displayed. A party leader said another elaborate model of current India contrasting with the India after Modi becomes PM will also be shown.
Bajpai said the rally in Agra will be bigger than earlier rallies of Modi as the region includes the birthplaces of Lord Krishna,former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deendayal Upadhyay. 
Agra is one of the two reserved Lok Sabha constituencies,which the BJP managed to win during last parliamentary elections. Agra also has one of the largest Dalit populations.

In a letter to Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil, Vasava stated he will submit his resignation as a Member of Parliament to the Lok Sabha Speaker during the upcoming Budget Session
The BJP leader, who is slated to meet senior BJP leaders at his Rajpipla residence Wednesday, told The Indian Express, “I have resigned due to my age-related health issues. I have been nursing some back and spine issues that are also triggering migraines. I have told the party previously that it is difficult for me to undertake extensive travelling in the constituency, especially with so many important elections coming up at the taluka panchayats and district level. The resignation is purely for my personal reasons and I do not intend to withdraw it. I have already assured the party that I will be available as any other primary member of the party for whatever work is needed of me. I have no grouse with either the party or the government.
His resignation comes days after he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the withdrawal of a Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) notification declaring 121 villages in Narmada district as an eco-sensitive zone to “mitigate the protests” by tribal communities.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Vasava, who has raised several tribal issues in the past, however, said the issue of the eco-sensitive zone should not be associated with his resignation. “The issue of including Narmada villages in the eco-sensitive zone is important and it has been there for five years. It is not a recent issue. It is not the reason for my resignation from the party. But I am hopeful that the government will move in the direction of resolving the issue soon for the locals. The government has, in the past, been receptive to the issues I have raised for tribal development,” Vasava said.
In his letter to Paatil, Vasava stated, “The party has given me opportunities beyond my capacity. I will always be grateful for this to the central leadership. I have been carefully adhering to the principles of the party as well as my personal belief system. But at the end of the day, I am a human, bound to err. So that my mistakes do not cause damage to the party, I am tendering my resignation. Please forgive me. I will also submit my resignation as Member of Parliament to the honourable Lok Sabha Speaker during the upcoming Budget Session.
On Tuesday evening, several supporters from Dediapada and Sagbara units of the parliamentary constituency of Narmada district — much of which falls under the eco-sensitive zone—gathered outside Vasava’s Rajpipla residence with resignation letters
Meanwhile, senior BJP functionaries, sources said, have rushed to request Vasava to reconsider his decision. Paatil told reporters that the party was hopeful of a solution soon. “In the letter sent to me, Vasava only mentioned that he will quit as an MP during the budget session. He is unhappy over some issues and I discussed them with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani this morning… We are trying to convince Vasava and I am confident of a solution on this issue soon,” Paatil said
A six-term MP, Vasava had earlier extended his support to the ongoing opposition of the tribals to May 5, 2016, MoEFCC notification that declares areas around Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, including 121 villages around the Statue of Unity, as eco-sensitive zone
His December 20 letter to the PM seeking withdrawal of the notification had come on a day when the General Administration Department of the state government had released a two-layer management plan for the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority, or the Statue of Unity Tourism Authority (SoUTA). Under the proposal, 201 personnel were to be recruited for operation and maintenance of water supply, sewage lines, roads, parking, lights as well as decorative lighting in the area of 25 sq metres in Kevadia colony
Two days ago, former Gujarat BJP MLA from Dediapada Assembly constituency of Narmada district, Motilal Vasava, who is also the party’s state tribal cell leader, had written to the sarpanches of the 121 villages to use the upcoming gram sabhas to pass resolutions against the government order for implementation of the MoEFCC notification
A letter issued by the local Narmada mamlatdars to villages under their territorial jurisdiction from November 7 onwards, said, “As per the letter of the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), Narmada, dated January 21, 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has published a final notification declaring eco-sensitive zone around Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Narmada on May 5, 2016. Accordingly, as per the provisions of the said notification of the central government, several activities will now stand prohibited in the eco-sensitive zone. The lands in the eco-sensitive zone — including that of the forest department, horticulture department, for agricultural use, plots reserved for parks — will not be allowed to be transferred for non-agricultural use, like commercial, industrial or residential purposes.
The letter stated that any land that needed to be transferred for non-agricultural use would be allowed to do so only after a “mandatory approval for such a transfer is sought from the state government”, based on an application of the monitoring committee.
“Right now, the area in the periphery of the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary has been included under the eco-sensitive zone and the entire village has been included in this list. Since the area is now under the notification of eco-sensitive zone, the process has been initiated to include the state government as the second owner of the lands in the villages as per their revenue survey numbers”, it stated. The inclusion of the state government in the Record of Rights prescribed under Village Form VII of the Land Revenue Records was made as per the notification of the central government, it added
In their objection, the villagers have cited “complete hold” on their lands, as guaranteed by the Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (or PESA) — a law enacted by the Government of India for ensuring self-governance through traditional gram sabhas for people living in the Scheduled Areas of India."

“The income from VAT, which comes largely by selling petrol, diesel and (CNG & PNG) gas, belongs 100 per cent to the Gujarat government. We do not have to give a single rupee to the Centre… If this income is included in GST, then Centre will become a 50 per cent partner and it will take away our profits for no reason,” Patel said on the last day of discussions on budgetary demands.
“I am not ready for this (to include petrol, diesel and gas under GST) as a finance minister. But in the interest of the nation, all the finance ministers have requested in the GST Council that the Government of India makes a formula or mechanism where income from VAT will continue as it is, despite fuel being included in GST. Only in such a scenario, the state government will agree (for fuel to be included under GST). I am the finance minister of Gujarat. The people have given us the responsibility and we have to maintain the trust,” Patel said. The DyCM also asked the Congress not to make such demands in the future.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“No state is ready for this. You can ask your government in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh if they are ready to include fuel in GST,” Patel told the Congress members.
The deputy chief minister also touched upon the prices of petrol and diesel prevailing in the state. He said Gujarat is ranked 19th on the list of states if the price of petrol is considered. “The price of petrol in Gujarat is less than Rajasthan and Maharashtra. We have already reduced VAT twice. The retail price of petrol in Gujarat is Rs 88.30 per litre, while in Congress-run Rajasthan, it is Rs 97.56. So, compared to us, the Congress government in Rajasthan is charging Rs 9 more,” Patel said. He added that price of petrol in Maharashtra is Rs 97.19.
At the beginning of the budget session, Congress MLA Gulabsinh Rajput had cycled to the Gujarat Assembly demanding the government to scale down the fuel prices in the state. In June last year, the state government had increased the VAT rates by almost four per cent.

Responding to the Congress legislators’ jibe on the Gujarat government for their “focus on organising festivals”, Patel said: “They (Congress) criticised Rannotsav saying that our expenditure is useless… The area where Rannotsav is held, 80 per cent of the population is Muslim. These people, who were struggling to earn a living, have flourished with the business that came in due to this festival organised in the winters. Lakhs of tourists go there now. Foreign tourists interested in staying in a “bhunga” (mud huts of Kutch) now come here.” Patel said a similar transformation was happening for the tribals living near the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The nurses have said that the private placement agency has not paid their salaries for the past two months. They have also accused the contractor of deducting their provident fund from their salaries and not depositing it with the government.
Leader of striking nurses Rajnikant Bharatiya, who is also the president of Gujarat Janata Jagruti Manch, said, “We will submit a memorandum to all 182 MLAs on October 11 at their respective offices between 10 and 11 am, with the demand of regular full pay and depositing of PF with the government.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“If MLAs can raise their own pay and perks, then why not ours,” he asked.
“On October 31, the nurses and other members of the manch will organise a ‘Run for Equality’ when the Government will be celebrating Run for Unity at the time of launch of Statue of Unity,” he said.
However, Bhartiya has requested the nurses to keep the interests of patients in mind and try to call off the stir.
Chairman of municipal corporation’s hospital committee Devang Dani said that the nurses had gone on strike demanding pay parity with other government nurses.
“But for the sake of patients, we have made alternate arrangements for getting staff from the contractor, because it is his duty to provide staff as per the agreement.

Setting the tone for the Lok Sabha elections next year and upcoming assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi coined a new term, ‘Ajey Bharat, Atal Bhajpa’ in his valedictory speech at the BJP national executive meet in New Delhi on Sunday. Modi also attacked the Opposition and the idea of Mahagathbandhan besides highlighting the achievements of his government.
Describing ‘Ajay Bharat, Atal Bhajpa’, an ode to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Modi said the phrase stood for “an India which is not to be subjugated by anyone and BJP which remains firmly committed to its principle”. On Vajpayee, Modi said that the late leader was like a sun in the sky and we will have to become ‘little stars’ to carry his ideas forward.
The prime minister also took potshots at the idea of a United Opposition or ‘Mahagathbandhan’, saying that those who do not see eye-to-eye and those who do not have any ideological similarity are willing to come together just to defeat us. He also said that no one, not even smaller parties, was ready to accept the leadership of the Congress in such an alliance.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Modi, however, said that there is a need for a capable Opposition in a democracy. But those who were a failure in government are also a failure as the Opposition, the prime minister said. He castigated the Opposition for not fighting over real issues but lies. He said that the government will counter the Opposition’s falsehood through “the great work we have done in four years”.
He also said that the party does not seek power as an instrument of sitting on the chair but to work for the people. He added that the BJP has been ruling in Gujarat for over 31 years and it has been possible because they are not hungry for power.

BJP President Amit Shah expressed his confidence over the party’s performance in next year’s general elections, stating that it will be in power for next 50 years after its win 2019. Addressing the BJP’s national executive meet, Shah said that the assertion was not borne out of arrogance but on the basis of its performance.
Shah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working hard and a lot of developmental work has been done by the government which will eventually lead them to victory. Highlighting that the country has now moved towards politics of performance, Shah said the BJP never relaxed even after assuming power in 2014.
PM Modi has given Sardar Patel the respect he deserved: Vijay Rupani
Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the respect to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel which Congress failed to give him. Speaking on the bylines of the BJP National Executive meet on Sunday, Rupani said that Congress always placed Sardar Patel behind Jawaharlal Nehru and therefore he never received the recognition he deserved on the world stage.
“When PM Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he had announced to make the statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel which is now going to be completed. On October 31, the world’s biggest statue, ‘Statue of Unity’, will be unveiled on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel,” Rupani told reporters. The statue has been made with world-class facilities, he said.
Rupani further said that the statue is a result of PM Modi’s vision, guidance and determination to give Sardar Patel the respect he deserves for his work towards the unity of India. He said that it was Patel who made all the princely states merge with the Indian territory during partition. India’s demography would have been different today had he not done that, Rupani said.

(File)
THE GUJARAT government on Monday declared October 30 as a holiday, thus giving a stretch of five days to its employees to celebrate Diwali, impressing upon being an “employee friendly government”. October 31 is already a government holiday for Sardar Patel Jayanti, though Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the Statue of Unity site that day. November 1, Friday, will mark Labh Pancham, the fifth day of the Gujarati new year, considered auspicious for businesses establishments to open new accounts. The bonus holiday to enjoy Diwali comes in lieu of November 9, which will now be a working Saturday, said a communication from the General Administration Department. Diwali, an important festival in Gujarat, falls on October 27, followed by the first day of the Gujarati new year and Bhai Beej, both of which (October 28 and 29) are holidays. In any case, nothing remains functional in Gujarat till Labh Pancham. Apart from the employees of the state government in Secretariat, the decision applies to all employees of state government undertakings, boards, corporations and panchayats.
What Toilets?
A DAY after a village panchayat block in Sehra taluka of Panchmahals put up hoardings declaring all eight villages under its jurisdiction as Open Defecation Free (ODF) during a ‘Seva Setu’ program, villagers from as many as three neighbourhoods approached the taluka-level officers claiming that no toilets were built in their villages. In their memorandum, the villagers stated, “If the villages are ODF, then 70 toilets have gone missing from the villages.” The revelation has now led to an inquiry being set up by the Mamlatdar. Preliminary investigations revealed that pits were dug for the toilets, but no further work was undertaken. While the pits were counted as ‘toilets’ for the gram panchayat, the villagers still go out and defecate in the open."

Around 2-3 trains run on these lines daily. (Express Photo)
Making a big exception in its gauge conversion policy, the Indian Railways has decided to preserve the five oldest, working narrow gauge lines dating back to its colonial era, part of what was Asia’s largest narrow-gauge light railway system, running since the 19th Century.
Commercially working narrow gauge lines are pretty much non-existent in the world, other than some hill railways in India, and this is an effort by the Railways to save them from complete extinction. All the lines are in Gujarat, totalling 204 km, and were originally owned by the princely state’s Gaekwad Baroda State Railway (GBSR).
A letter that the five narrow gauge lines would be preserved was issued on Thursday. Around two-three pairs of trains (up and down) operate on these lines every day, with marginal footfalls.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
One of the sections, the 33-km Dabhoi-Miyagam line, was India’s first narrow gauge railway stretch. It started operations in 1862, when coaches were pulled by oxen, before steam engines were deployed the following year. The Maharaja of Baroda, the owner of GBSR, subsequently built a network of light railways, connecting most towns in his state. Dabhoi remained the centre of the narrow gauge network. Later a workshop was also built at Pratap Nagar near Baroda.
Policymakers at the Railway Ministry have been keen to preserve this key industrial heritage. A ground assessment of the ministry shows it draws many foreign tourists every year.
Apart from the Dabhoi-Miyagam lines, the other lines are Miyagam-Malsar (38 km), Charonda-Moti Karal (19 km), Pratap Nagar-Jambusar (51 km) and Bilmora-Waghi (63 km).
Incidentally, another arm of the railway network, from the Dabhoi section to Chandod, is part of the gauge conversion project to link to the Gujarat government’s proposed Statue of Unity. Policymakers said the project will not be affected by the new conservation decision.
However, the ministry may have to alter a few related gauge-conversion projects sanctioned in the past, before this policy change. The erstwhile Gwalior Light Railway in Madhya Pradesh, another piece of narrow gauge heritage from the era of the princely states, has already been marked for gauge conversion following years of sustained pressure from local politicians.
The decision to preserve GBSR was taken by Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani, along with the Financial Commissioner and Member (Engineering) of the Board. Western Railway, in whose jurisdiction the lines fall, has been asked to make a detailed plan ascertaining the resources required to not just preserve the lines but to develop them for promoting heritage railway tourism.
Sources said that at the meeting it was pointed out that past decisions regarding conversion of many of the narrow gauge lines in Gujarat were taken not because of operational needs of the Railways but due to local political pressure.
Currently, gauge conversion is happening on lines that have been defunct for 15-20 years — unlike the five identified for preservation. These five lines, connecting far-flung areas of Gujarat, are more or less “island lines”, and gauge conversion will not significantly add to the connectivity value for the local population, according to officials.
In narrow gauge in India, the rails are 2 feet, 6 inches apart, requiring engines, coaches, machinery and maintenance apparatus that are different from the rest of the broad gauge network, whose rails are 5 ft, 6 inches apart.
“Firstly these are island lines, preserving them will not adversely affect the rest of the network, and secondly, it appears that gauge conversion and electrification of these lines will not be financially viable, whereas preserving them will be invaluable,” said Sanjoy Mookerjee, former financial commissioner of Indian Railways and a mentor of the Railway Ministry’s Heritage Conservation Committee, headed by the Railway Board Chairman."

(Source: PTI)
Even as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 142nd birth anniversary on Tuesday was commemorated with much fanfare, there was a moment of faux pas when the official Twitter handle of the Statue of Unity (@souindia) referred to October 31 as the leader’s “67th birthday”. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the annual Run for Unity from Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium.
The tweet came at around 4.35 pm on Tuesday, with a poster of Sardar Patel that said, “Remembering an Architect of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 67th birthday.” There was also a quote attributed to the Iron Man, “Caste, Community will rapidly disappear. We have to speedily forget all these things. Such boundaries hamper our growth.”
Incidentally, this is the first tweet posted by the official handle since December 15, 2016, which is Sardar Patel’s death anniversary. In its December tweet, the handle correctly pays tribute to Patel on his 66th death anniversary, saying, “Remembering the #IronManOfIndia, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, on his 66th Punya Tithi. ”

When contacted, an official from Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) called Tuesday’s incident a “typographical error” and said the tweet would be rectified soon.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Currently, about 2,400 workers are involved in the construction of the 182-metre tall statue, which is touted to be the world’s tallest. The Statue of Unity, Modi’s dream project, is coming up at Sadhu Bet – about 3 kilometres from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam. So far, about 104 meters of the statue has been erected (the waist portion), which is at 157 meters above the mean sea level (240 metres).
In the off-site workshop of the project, several workers from TQ Art Foundry, which belongs to Jiangxi Tongqing Company based in Nanchang in Eastern China, are assist ing the Larsen and Toubro (L&T) engineers in assembling the bronze cladding of the facade.
SSNNL officials confirmed the bronze cladding had already arrived from China and would soon make its way to the construction site. The workshop has also received an 8 metre-tall prototype of the head of Sardar Patel with detailed facial expressions that will now be replicated to build a 45 metre-tall structure to be fitted on the torso of the statue."

“These people are neither with the farmer, nor with the youth and nor with the soldiers,” he said.
“Today, even when the central government is giving the farmers their rights, these people came down on protest. These people want the farmers of the country could not sell their produce in the open market. These people are now insulting the farmers by setting fire to the goods and equipment that the farmer worships,” the PM said in an apparent reference to an incident at Rajpath where a group of men, including several members of the Youth Congress’s Punjab unit, set a tractor on fire on Monday morning to protest against the farm laws.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Criticising the opposition, the Prime Minister said they also opposed the government’s initiatives of opening Jan-dhan accounts of poor and promotion of digital payments, the introduction of GST, implementation of one rank, one pension, surgical strikes, 10-percent reservation to the poor, organization of the International Yoga Day, acquisition of rafale fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force, unveiling the statue of unity, and the laying of foundation stone of Shriram temple.
“The country is seeing how some people are protesting just for the sake of protest,” Modi said. “It has become a habit of these people to oppose everything that is happening for the country. The only way of their politics is opposition,” he said.
The prime minister, who inaugurated six projects related to Namami Gange mission in Uttarakhand via video conferencing, said those opposing farm reform laws want middlemen to earn profit at the cost of farmers’ freedom. “Farmers can now sell their produce to anyone, anywhere. But when the Centre is giving farmers their rights, these people are opposing it. They don’t want farmers to sell their produce in open market, they want middlemen to earn profit. They are opposing the freedom of farmers,” PM Modi said.


The prime minister also said that the chorus around his government doing away with minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce is “misleading”. “For years, they said that they will implement MSP but they never did. This was done by our govt as per the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission,” he said.
ExplainSpeaking: What farmers should be demanding instead of MSPs
“Today these people are also spreading confusion over MSP. There will also be MSP in the country and the farmer will also have the freedom to sell crops anywhere in the country. But some people are unable to tolerate this freedom. They are having problem as another means of their earning black money has ended,” he added.
“Today these people are spreading confusion among the farmers about the MSP. The MSP will remain in the country and the farmers’ freedom to sell their produce anywhere will also remain,” he said.
On the clean Ganga mission, PM Modi said in the past decades, huge initiatives were taken up to clean the river but they failed as they had “neither public participation nor farsightedness”.
“Had the old methods been adopted, the situation would have been equally bad today. But we moved forward with new thinking, new approach. We have not limited the Namami Gange Mission to the cleanliness of Ganga, but have made it the largest and comprehensive river conservation program in the country,” the PM said.
PM Modi also marked the four years of Surgical Strikes carried out by the Indian Army, saying when the brave armymen carried out strikes and destroyed the bases of terror in Pakistan, the Opposition was seeking evidence. “By opposing the surgical strike also, these people have cleared their intention in front of the country,” the PM said."

There is no electricity and no telephones. Prashant Nadkar
At a time when election fervour is at its peak across the country, 28-year-old Zeba Vasave, a resident of Manibeli village in north Maharashtra’s Nandurbar, is unaware of the election rhetoric. Ask her who Narendra Modi is, she says she does not know. Ask her who Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are. She does not know.
Bhika isn’t alone. With no access to the basic facilities, tribal families residing in this village find the poll rhetoric irrelevant.

Tucked away in the remotest corner of the district, Manibeli is the first village listed on Maharashtra’s voter rolls. An election campaign in Manibeli is unlike most other places in the country because of two simple reasons — its geography and its people.
Situated along the Satpuda mountain range, the tribal pocket is inaccessible by road. A two-hour boat ride in the backwaters of the Narmada river is the only way to travel to the place. With no electricity and telephone connectivity either, the village is virtually cut-off from the rest of the mainland.
While election cavalcades are busy reaching out to voters across the country, Manibeli’s first sarpanch, Narayan Tadvi (65), claimed: “No one (MP, MLA, top politicians) has ever come here. We’re only identified as village number 1 in the voter rolls. But nobody really cares about us.”

According to Tadvi, the fact that the village has been declared as an “area under submergence” in the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) hasn’t helped at all. “Each time the local gram panchayat has pushed for a power connection or for accrual of benefits of the government-run schemes, they’ve hit a wall. The proposals are turned down, citing the ‘area under submergence’ status. More than 240 families reside in Manibeli. But the authorities just refuse to acknowledge their presence,” said Chetan Salve, an activist with Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) that has been fighting for the rights of the local tribals. “The situation is not dissimilar in 32 other dam-affected villages (in Maharashtra) in the vicinity,” he added.

Bhura Vasave (60) echoed his viewpoint. “India got Independence in 1947. But it does not feel that it has been good for our village.”

Just as political parties have been lining up behind digitisation initiatives to rev up their poll campaigns, lack of community forces villagers here to use “rudimentary means of communication”.
“We have no electricity. There is no telephone connection,” said Natwar Tadvi, a local. Also, while the government has been pushing the project of building pucca homes and toilets in other tribal pockets, villagers here are yet to benefit from one.
For the record, Manibeli was among the first villages from Maharashtra to be declared as Sardar Sarovar-affected in the mid-1980s. When the dam waters were released in 1994-95, Manilal Tadvi (75) recounts how the entire village was marooned. “We lost our houses and livestock. Our crops were ravaged. While we rebuilt our homes but were never compensated adequately for it.”
In fact, Jatar Vasave (58) alleged that the full compensation that was promised for acquisition of their farmland hasn’t been released yet. Latika Rajput, another NBA activist, said that families rehabilitated in Gujarat have only been given 50 per cent compensation as land acquisition.
The dam’s height has since been raised on five occasions. But dissatisfied with the total compensation package offered, many villagers in Manibeli and the nearby 32 others villages have refused to accept the aid. “We’ve relocated upwards four times since 1994. Each time, something has been left behind,” said Jadiben Tadvi (65).
The village is also plagued with high unemployment and illiteracy. Ishwar Vasave (20) said the nearest secondary medium government school is 10 km away. There is also dearth of inhouse health facilities. While the state has a health sub-centre and a floating dispensary, villagers complain that these are understaffed, and mostly unavailable. While NBA has been running Jeevanshalas to educate children till Class IV, the state government, while recognising their existence, has refused proposals to give them grants.
The dearth of facilities is the toughest on the women, who have to walk up to the river or a spring carrying containers to fetch water. This journey can range between 500 m and more than 5 km.
Referring to the Statue of Unity, which is just 7 km away, Narayan Tadvi said, “People come to watch the statue, but nobody comes to see us.”"

The Run was flagged off from Vallabh Sadan on Ashram Road at 8 am in the presence of senior BJP leaders and party functionaries.
Expressing his pleasure on the occasion,Advani said this event was a true tribute to Sardar Patel and thanked the participants for turning up in large numbers. He said that while Sardar Patel had united the country,the BJP would resolve to make India the best.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While commemorating the 63rd death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,the run also marks the beginning of a campaign to collect iron tools from all over the country for the Statue of Unity. 
Remembering the day the country got its independence in 1947,Advani said he was immensely happy that day,but could not celebrate it because he was in Karachi at that time. He also said he was saddened by the countrys Partition  that caused severe trauma and suffering to the people including my parents there. I was saddened by the trauma and pain suffered by our people,including my own parents, he said. 
When the British left the country,they had imagined that they had not just partitioned India,but with that also freed the 570-odd princely states from mainland India. But Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel unified the country and made India one; we now make a resolve to make India the best, he said. 
He expressed faith that the campaign for collection of iron from all over the country to build the Statue of Unity near the Sardar Sarovar dam would make Indians feel proud,when visitors from all over the world would come to see it and remember the contribution of Sardar Patel as a unifier of the country into a great nation.
On the occasion,Ahmedabad mayor Minaxi Patel thanked everyone who had come to take part in the event. 
Advani sees no alliance with AAP
Declining to make any specific comments on the current political situation in the wake of the Assembly elections,L K Advani said,On the current political situation,I wont make any specific comment. We have won in all four states and we have formed governments in three of them…except Delhi. It is no big deal,such things keep happening in life, he said.
However,he ruled out any alliance with the Aam Admi Party. Advani said there was no question of joining hands with Aam Admi Party to form a government in Delhi.
We have passed through situations in the past when we (BJP) were left with only two members in the Lok Sabha. But later we had formed the government under Vajpayeeji for two terms. I am proud of what we have achieved in those six years under Vajpayeeji, he added,when asked about the partys next move regarding the elections outcome. 
Cong waves black flags,detained
Around 40 members of Youth Congress here waved black flags at the Run for Unity,which was flagged off by BJP patriarch L K Advani at the mega event on Sunday morning. The police detained them and released after the event got over.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Congresss city unit  president Pankaj Shah said the black flags were not against the Run,but against corruption and the snooping row. Modi should first come clean on the Godhara carnage,the snooping row. Now this sudden commemoration of Sardar Patel just when election is round the corner, Shah said. He went on to say that an event like Run for Unity alone would do no good to the country. It must be all-inclusive…ensuring justice to riot victims …Modi must first change himself and apologise to the country for his role in the Godhra carnage. Otherwise,he has no right to talk of unity, he said."

This year, Deepavali was special. While India was preparing to celebrate the festival of lights, India’s development journey, too, was witnessing four landmark events unfold. India jumped 23 places in just one year in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EODB) 2018 rankings, climbing to 77 among nearly 190 countries. India is the only country to rank among the top 10 improvers for the second consecutive year. Effectively, in four years of the NDA government, India’s ranking has improved 65 places.
Reforms come first and rankings are just an indicator of reforms. This sharp rise in the EODB rankings is evidence of the success of a number of reforms brought in by the Modi government. For example, the rankings indicate that dealing with construction permits has become much easier. Always languishing in the 180s on this parameter, India came up to the 52nd position — an unprecedented jump. The success of GST, too, is partly captured by the reference period of the report and its impact will be seen in the next edition as well. From starting businesses to getting electricity, from accessing credit to streamlining processes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ushering in ease of doing business for entrepreneurs has taken off. This means more economic growth, more investment and more jobs.
The speed and scale with which the government works was shown in a related reform. A big bang announcement of facilitating loans of up to Rs 1 crore in just 59 minutes for MSMEs was announced, a move that shows the government’s priorities. Modi announced the 12-point Support and Outreach Initiative for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises on November 2, 2018. A web portal launched by the government to enable this is all set to revolutionise the way MSMEs get loans and is well on the way to setting new benchmarks in credit availability. This should get the engines of an already rapidly growing economy whirring even harder, given that MSMEs are a big contributor to jobs and economic activity in India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Credit to MSMEs had already received a shot in the arm with the MUDRA scheme that ensures collateral-free bank loans to small entrepreneurs. The scale of success of this programme is astounding: Over 14 crore entrepreneurs — out of which roughly 70 per cent are women, have received more than Rs 6 lakh crore worth of loans.
If there was cheer for India on the economic front, there was pride to be felt in the ability of our engineers. Last fortnight also saw the unveiling of the mammoth Statue of Unity, of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, by PM Modi. The tallest statue in the world, standing at the height of 182 meters, it is almost double the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US.
This is an India that not only thinks big but also achieves within aggressive timelines. Sardar Patel’s statue is already attracting numerous tourists and the State of Unity also marks the fact that India is now recognising its true heroes.
When governance, reforms and implementation are the focus of the government, the achievements come in from multiple fronts. Another historic first unfolded — the movement of the first cargo vessel on an inland waterway after Independence. With the launch of the first multi-modal terminal or inland waterway in Varanasi, India opened a new chapter in its history. PM Modi received the first container vessel in Varanasi which had sailed from Kolkata carrying cargo for PepsiCo India on the Ganga.
Promoting inland waterways as a cheaper and more environment-friendly means of transport should always have been higher on India’s priorities and it is finally getting done under the Modi government, which aims to develop the Ganga River between Varanasi and Haldia for navigation of large vessels weighing up to 1,500-2,000 tonnes.
To give you a perspective of its importance, India’s logistics costs are about twice that of the US, according to the shipping ministry. So, the creation of inland waterways is a significant addition to the infrastructure of our country. It will boost the economy by making the logistics much cheaper. The Varanasi terminal will enable cargo movement and develop an inland waterways corridor that can provide great impetus to the Eastern part of India.
In just one fortnight around Deepavali, India has given itself multiple reasons to celebrate — a New India is seen all around.

Each of these achievements have an unambiguous Narendra Modi stamp on them — the ability to dream and the ability to do."

A day after he referred to the managing director of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), Rajiv Kumar Gupta, as an ‘angrez’ officer for evicting tribal vendors from around the Statue of Unity, BJP MP from Bharuch and tribal leader Mansukh Vasava said he stands by his remark. He said he has written to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to take action in the matter and provide livelihood to the tribals whose shops were demolished on Tuesday.
The SSNNL had on Tuesday removed “encroachments” from villages in Kevadia colony such as Limdi and Navagam, around the Statue of Unity.
“I received a frantic call from a tribal family from Kevadia in the morning of Tuesday stating that the SSNNL had sent bull dozers without even serving any warning to evict shop owners on the road to Statue of Unity,” Vasava said, speaking to The Indian Express. “Although it is not my constituency (Kevadia colony falls under Chhota Udepur whose MP is BJP’s Geeta Rathwa), I rushed from my residence in Rajpipla. By the time I reached, they had already razed the shops. It was an insensitive act.” The Bharuch MP said, “I know that Modiji himself wouldn’t approve of this autocratic behaviour. Rupaniji and Modiji have already said that tribals have to be given employment and treated with utmost sensitivity in such matters. I have written to the chief minister to take action and ensure that these tribals are not left without an income.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Vasava said he dashed the letter to Rupani from Kevadia itself. I have told them that these are not encroachers who have just turned up overnight to be thrown out,” he said. “These are families that have been selling food and cold drinks to tourists for over five years. Some of them have been there since the time of the construction of the Narmada dam and when Jaypee group was working here,” he explained.
“To send bulldozers and just crush their shops is not the way,” Vasava said. “Unfortunately, some officials are so blinded by power, sitting in AC offices, that they don’t understand the plight of tribals. If there is a need to shift them it should be done in a decent way by giving them an alternate source of livelihood.”"

(Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)
Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel on Thursday inaugurated multiple projects at Karnali village, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s adopted village under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna. The union minister, who could not attend the inauguration due to medical reasons, spoke at the event through video conferencing. “Even if I can not visit Karnali under certain circumstances, somebody from family will represent me,” he said. His son Rohan Jaitley was present at the occasion.
Among the projects launched on the day was a bridge connecting Chandod to Karnali that reduced a 50-km journey to just under 4 km. It was constructed at a cost of Rs 17.5 crore and the foundation stone for which was laid by Jaitley in 2016. Other projects include a renovated Somnath Ghat and seating arrangement for villagers and pilgrims to the site. Jaitley’s aide Parindu Bhagat, who was also on the dais, named the bridge “Pujya Dadaji Setu”.
“Arun Jaitley is still in isolation to avoid any infection after his surgery. And keeping the humidity and the weather in mind, he couldn’t make it and so Rohan did,” Bhagat told The Indian Express, referring to Jaitley’s recent kidney transplant. Jaitley hailed village residents for making Karnali an adarsh village. Recently, it had got three new ATMs, 478 toilets making it open defecation free, an overhead water tank for which 10 per cent of the expense was borne by the residents, and solar panels were installed.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“For generations to come, the villagers and pilgrims will be benefitted by the vision helmed by Arun Jaitley,” said Patel. He went on to laud Bhagat and his family for their contribution towards the village and said, “Arun Jaitley and Kakuji (as Bhagat is known in party circles) have familial ties and I would want to tell you that Arun Jaitley’s decision to choose Karnali as an adarsh village is only because of Kakuji and his family.”
He also criticised the Congress. “In the 60 years of their rule, the Congress never thought of a scheme where Parliamentarians are given grants to uplift poor villages. But the present government did under the leadership of the Prime Minister,” Patel said. He added that villages in Kheda, Mehsana, Anand and Vadodara are “happy villages” with donations and funds from NRIs but villages which are devoid of any facilities were always ignored until the gram sansad yojna.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Patel further emphasised on how Gujarat will attract more tourists with these developmental projects, including the Statue of Unity. He promised more grants to Karnali and develop it as a pilgrimage spot. Chhota Udepur MP Ramsinh Rathwa and Dabhoi MLA Sailesh Mehta were also present at the inauguration."

State BJP president Jitu Vaghani on Saturday congratulated party workers of the Sabarkantha district unit, at a meeting held in Himmatnagar, for winning six of the 11 seats in six nagarpalikas where by-elections were held on Tuesday. He said that the result showed that people had not accepted the Congress, because it was spreading ‘caste hatred’ as opposed to the BJP’s idea of overall public welfare.
He said that Congress had had a long tradition of insulting Sardar Patel while Narendra Modi had worked for Sardar Patel’s prestige by increasing the height of Sardar Sarovar dam.
Taking the opportunity to attack Congress president Rahul Gandhi for calling the Statue of Unity ‘Made in China’, Vaghani said, “Rahul equated Patel with a shoe. The BJP will agitate against this insult.”
Seeking an apology from Rahul, he said that he was sure the people of Gujarat would avenge this insult of Sardar."

BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday said that Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor “cannot dare to enter Bihar” following the recent protests against Hindi-speaking migrants in Gujarat. The BJP has been accusing Kshatriya Thakor Sena, an outfit led by the Radhanpur MLA, of fomenting anti-migrant sentiment in Gujarat in the wake of the arrest of a migrant labourer from Bihar for allegedly raping a toddler. A video of Thakor making provocative speeches against north Indian migrants had also surfaced then.
“He (Alpesh Thakor) cannot dare to enter Bihar after his conduct towards North Indians here in Gujarat,” Modi said during his visit to the Statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony in Narmada district.
“Locals should be given priority (in jobs), but it was also true that if Biharis leave Gujarat, factories in the state will shut down. People are free to migrate and work anywhere they want to, and nobody could stop them,” Modi added, referring to the exodus of north Indian migrants from Gujarat in late September and early October following incidents of attacks on them.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When told that the Congress MLA was scheduled to take part in Chhath festivities in Ahmedabad in the evening, Modi quipped, “Image cleansing wont help (Alpesh Thakor) anymore.”
Meanwhile, Thakor, who attended a Chhath Puja function on the banks of Sabarmati river in Shahibaug area of Ahmedabad in the evening, termed Bihar Deputy CM’s remark as unfortunate. “It is very unfortunate that on an auspicious day of Chhath, he (Modi) is using such language. He is speaking such divisive language while standing next to the Statue of Unity. It shows that he is not interested in uniting people… Like Gujarat is of Biharis, Bihar is also of Gujaratis. And I will be going to Bihar,” Thakor told The Indian Express.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Thakor said that he was pleasantly surprised by the love and affection showered to him by people from Bihar, UP and Jharkhand who were taking part in the Chhath festivities. “They said that they know me and do not believe things reported against me (related to the recent attacks on North Indian migrants). They even told me to contest Lok Sabha elections from Ahmedabad (East) constituency,” he added.

The Uttar Pradesh government Tuesday expressed its resentment over the removal of “UP Rising” hoardings carrying Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s photograph that it had put up in Ahmedabad. It termed the act as “not a healthy trend” in welcoming the guests.
“When Chinese President (Xi Jinping) is welcome in Gujarat, why not UP CM and its NRI department?” asked Madhukar Jatley, advisor, NRI Department of UP, here Tuesday, adding, “We have raised the issue of removal of hoardings from Ahmedabad with concerned authorities. But we have not lodged any FIR in this connection”.
He was referring to the removal of posters and hoardings with the message “UP Rising” from areas like C G Road, Ashram and Airport promoting UP as preferred investment destination — an aggressive marketing strategy by the Samajwadi Party against its arch rival BJP, whose government is hosting the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit 2015 this week.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As many as 15 heads of department will be coming to Gujarat and Akhilesh will address a seminar to woo NRIs at Pravasi Bhartiya Divas on January 9. UP is one of the co-partners of the three-day event. Jatley said, “We have just come here, and we are trying to tell the investors about UP.”
While 14 chief ministers are expected at the event, UP was the only state to resort to aggressive marketing plan in Gujarat. Around 60 small hoardings and 40 billboards promoting UP as investment destination had come up in Ahmedabad. Besides, UP government is also aggressively promoting itself on FM channels.
Jatley said Gujarat was best at showcasing itself as an investment destination, “Five metro projects have already been started in UP with a total budget of Rs 2.5 lakh crore, which is nearly equal to the state’s annual budget. But in Gujarat, we are still hearing about one metro project for the last 13 years. It has gained some momentum now. But the push has come from the Centre, and not the state,” he added.
Jetley further said even Varanasi (Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency) will be connected with metro. “And, about PM cleaning the mess (Ganga clean up project) of Varanasi, it is all a propaganda,” he added.
Even for the Statue of Unity, a project of world’s tallest statue conceptualised by Narendra Modi, he expressed doubts. “To say that Taj Mahal will be replaced by Statue of Unity as symbol of India for foreigners is far fetched. First, the statue should come up,” he said.
The team from UP said that in May 2014, they created a dedicated NRI department owing to the fact that huge chunk of diaspora is from UP. On the lines of Pravasi Bhartiya Divas, they are going to have their own Uttar Pradesh NRI Divas from February 28 to March 1 in Agra.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Over 150 NRIs of UP-origin have registered for participation in the event. Led by Akhilesh, the UP government would project its initiatives for the NRIs as well as government’s development agenda, along with one-to-one interactions with the officials."

On the 31st of this month, when his mammoth statue is unveiled, India will see the Sardar raised to the sky.
Here’s a slice of history. On 15 January 1948, rebutting stories that Vallabhbhai Patel was a reason for his latest fast, Gandhi frontally rebuked the Sardar’s critics for, as he put it, “isolating [Patel], a lifelong and faithful comrade, from Pandit Nehru and me, whom they gratuitously raise to the sky”. (Collected Works 90: 427)
Privately or publicly, some will portray the unveiling as Patel’s liberation, 68 years after his death, from Gandhi and Nehru, and congratulate the statue for soaring past Gandhi and Nehru, leaving the latter two stranded on mere earth. Others may want to know what the flesh-and-blood Vallabhbhai was really like, and whether, as Gandhi also said in those remarks of 15 January 1948, Vallabhbhai’s heart was “expansive enough to accommodate all” even if his “bluntness of speech sometimes unintentionally hurts”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Can we get to know, today in our 21st century, a heart that began its life in the 19th century and expired in the middle of the 20th? Researching the Sardar in the late 1980s, I was staggered by his self-sacrifice.
Since Patel never kept a journal, authored no book and penned very few articles, his life was largely revealed by letters he wrote, by the diaries of his daughter Maniben, and by records, his companions kept, especially prison-mates.
Early in life, he stepped aside to enable older brother Vitthalbhai to study law in London. Later he stepped aside three times to enable Jawaharlal Nehru to become Congress president— in 1929, 1937 and 1946. He did so at Gandhi’s prompting, just as prodded by Gandhi, he had given up a flourishing legal practice in 1918 to fight for Kheda’s peasants.
In August 1942, when Patel was 67, he along with 53-year-old Jawaharlal, Abul Kalam Azad, who was 54, Kripalani, also 54, Govind Ballabh Pant, 55, Pattabhi Sitaramayya of the Telugu country, who was 62, and six other Congress Working Committee members entered the 16th century Ahmednagar Fort. It would be their prison for three years while a world war raged outside. They were allowed only the slenderest contact with relatives, and none whatever with Gandhi, who was held in another detention site in the Marathi country, Pune’s Aga Khan Palace.
Letters from the prisoners to their families, diaries that Nehru and Pattabhi kept during the incarceration, and an oral history later provided by the youngest prisoner, Odisha’s Hare Krushna Mahtab, 42, tells a story of clashes and truces, bridge games and badminton in a historic fort. It would make for a riveting movie.
Six inmates wrote a book each in prison: Nehru, Azad, Pattabhi, Kripalani, Narendra Deva and Mahtab. As for the oldest prisoner, Patel, he read book after book from the Fort’s limited library, soaked up every line in the few newspapers that were let in, made threads with his charkha, walked numberless times up and down a 200-foot path, played bridge, and grew flowers.
Patel proved an expert mali, as did Nehru. Pattabhi noted that a “heavenly blue morning glory creeper” grown by the Sardar became “the talk” of the Fort. Patel’s greatest role, however, was to preserve the prisoners’ morale by making them laugh. “He chokes you with laughter by his sharp and incisive wit,” Pattabhi recorded. When a Major-General Candy, Bombay presidency’s surgeon-general, visited to check on the Empire’s prisoners and asked Patel, whom he had met in Ahmedabad 18 years previously, if his age was around 58, the Sardar answered: “I am 67 and looking forward to another 33 years.” (Pattabhi, Feathers & Stones)
Flint-like before the foe, Patel’s heart softened when he remembered co-workers and their families, enquiring after each member when letters were allowed to go out.
In the Sardar, sacrifice, fortitude and empathy were joined by a sense of responsibility and loyalty. Gandhi’s assassination almost shattered Home Minister Patel. Four days thereafter, on 3 February 1948, a letter published in The Statesman asked for the Sardar’s resignation, while JP remarked that “at 74 Patel was holding departments” that were too much “even for a man of thirty”. (The Times of India, 4 February 1948) 
That day Patel wrote a letter to Nehru calling the demand for his exit “justified” and offered to resign, but he did not send the letter. (SPC 6: 27-28) He did not then know what Jawaharlal had written that same day:
3 February: “My dear Vallabhbhai, With Bapu’s death, we have to face a different and more difficult world. I have been greatly distressed by the persistence of whispers about you and me, magnifying out of all proportion any differences we may have. We must put an end to this mischief. “For over a quarter century, you and I have faced many storms and perils together. In this crisis we now face, I think it is my duty, and if I may venture to say yours also, for us to face it together as friends and colleagues, not merely superficially but in full loyalty to one another and with confidence in one another.”
Vallabhbhai replied (5 February): “I am deeply touched, indeed overwhelmed by… your letter. We have been lifelong comrades… The paramount interests of our country and our mutual love and regard, transcending such differences of outlook and temperament as existed, have held us together. I had the good fortune to have a last talk with Bapu for over an hour just before his death. His opinion also binds us both.” (SPC 6: 29-31)
Witnessing sharp conflicts but also overcoming them, their partnership until Patel’s death in December 1950 enabled the enactment of a Constitution assuring equal rights to all Indians and the merger of princely states into the Union of India.
In his Reminiscences, Patel’s ICS secretary, V Shankar, recorded one of Patel’s last speeches, made in Indore on 2 October 1950. The Sardar’s words, Shankar informs us, came “amid sobs and emotions”: “Today I see before me the whole picture of life ever since I joined Bapu’s army. Bapu gave life to a dead country. Ba lent him a helping hand. We were all soldiers in their camp. I have been referred to as the Deputy Prime Minister. I never think of myself in these terms. Jawaharlal Nehru is our leader. Bapu appointed him as his successor. It is the duty of all Bapu’s soldiers to carry out his bequest. I am not a disloyal soldier. I am satisfied that I still am where Bapu posted me.” (Reminiscences 2: 136-7)
Less than ten weeks after he made these remarks, Patel died in Bombay, where Rajendra Prasad, who was the President, Nehru and CR were among those joining in the last rites. Very few are aware that in independent India’s first Cabinet the Sardar was the I&B Minister as well as being Minister for Home, which meant that All India Radio was in his direct charge. AIR’s archives probably contain recordings of Patel’s public utterances after independence, including that speech of 2 October 1950."

Nestled between the Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges in Kevadia of Narmada district, the 182-metre-high statue dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, built at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore, is said to be the tallest in the world.
Since the SoU was inaugurated in October 2018, the state government has worked to bring Kevadia on the world map of tourism with a cluster of theme-based projects. The government projects the SoU to have an economic impact of Rs 9,000 crore by 2022, which will translate into the socio-economic uplift of the region up to a radius of about 100 km around the statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi, who spent the entire day inspecting each of these tourist spots, also laid the foundation stone of four new projects that are coming up in the area.
The inaugurations, which were to originally take place on March 26, had to be postponed due to the Covid-19 lockdown, and were ultimately done to coincide with the 145th birth anniversary celebrations of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Saturday (October 31).
What is the Kevadia Tourism Circuit?
Kevadia, a village in the tribal Narmada district, is home to the Sardar Sarovar Dam reservoir on the Narmada river, and was a popular picnic spot even before the SoU came up.  .📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram
The circuit covers 35 tourist spots, out of which the Valley of Flowers, Vishwa Van, Jungle Safari, Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Ekta Nursery, Tent City, Khalvani Eco-tourism, Zarwani Eco-tourism, Nauka Vihar and River Rafting, located around the periphery of the statue and the Narmada Dam, are already open.

Last year, the Gujarat Assembly passed a Bill to establish the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority (SoUTA) that will have powers ranging from acquiring land for any development project in the area, which is predominantly tribal, to taking punitive action against those violating it or encroaching on it.
What are some of the major attractions of the Circuit?
* Sardar Patel Zoological Park and Jungle Safari
The park is spread over an area of 375 acres at seven levels ranging in altitude from 29 metres to 180 metres. It houses more than 100 species of animals and birds, including wallaby (a macropod related to the kangaroo and found in Australia and New Guinea); llama and alpaca (camelid species native to the Andes of South America); giraffe, zebra, blue wildebeest, gemsbok or oryx, and impala (all native to Africa).
In all, the safari will have 1,100 birds and animals, and will be the only safari of its kind in the country with such a wide range of exotic animals. The animals and birds arrived from different countries last year, and were quarantined for a month, during which some died.

There are two aviaries, constructed as geodesic domes, claimed to be among the largest in the world: the Indian Aviary is 150 m long, 50 m wide, and 15 m high; the Exotic Aviary is 125 m long, 35 m wide and 18 m high. In the petting zone, tourists can pet a macaw, cockatoo, Persian cat, rabbit, guinea pig, turkey, goose, and miniature pony, sheep, and goat.
* Children’s Nutrition Park
The park is billed as the “world’s first technology driven Nutrition Park”. It will offer a “nutri-train” ride on a 600-m track around the 35,000 sq m park, passing through five theme-based stations: “Phalshaka Griham”, “Payonagari”, “Annapoorna”, “Poshan Puram” and “Swastha Bharatam”.
Each of the stations has a mascot — for example, “Kumar Kisan”, a puppet farmer who tells the story of how he grows fruits and vegetables at Phalshakha; an animated cow grazer “Janardhan” at Payonagri, who explains the importance of milk; and a doting mother at Annapoorna.
The stations have interactive games to instill the value of healthy foods in children. There is also a five-minute-long 5D animation film on India’s “unity in food diversity”, with animated characters talking of food habits in the West, East, North and South of India.
* The Mirror Maze
It has a 5D virtual reality (VR) theatre and augmented reality (AR) games to enhance nutritional awareness through entertainment.
* Carnival look
The 8.5 km stretch of road from Ekta Dwar to the Sardar Sarovar Dam is decorated with colourful motifs and lights that lend the area a festive, carnival appearance after sunset. The Unity Glow garden, spread over around 3.61 acres, is a unique theme park developed with glimmering installations, figures, and optical illusions.
* Riverfront cycling tour
This starts from the Valley of Flowers parking. It is a family-friendly guided bicycle tour that includes small-frame kids bicycles and regular bicycles for adventure enthusiasts. There is also a tandem cycle tour available for couples, as well as electric cycles.
* The Gardens
The Cactus Garden is a grand greenhouse with 450 national and international species of cactii and other plants from 17 countries. The area of its dome is 836 sq m, and the garden has an open area of 25 acres. There are 6 lakh plants, including 1.9 lakh cactii, 1.6 lakh succulent plants, and 2.5 lakh ornamental plants.
The Aarogyavan is spread over an area of about 17 acres, has 5 lakh plants of 380 different species. It also has an aarogya kutir, set up in association with the Thiruvananthapuram-based Santhigiri Wellness Centre. This is a traditional Kerala treatment facility that provides modern holistic healthcare, ayurveda, siddha, yoga and panchkarma.
Some of the therapies available at the wellness centre include abhyangam (synchronised body massage), shirodhara (for neurological disorders, insomnia, migraine and stress), and shirovasti (beneficial for strokes and hypertension).
* The cruises
A ferry boat service called the Ekta Cruise, goes from Shrestha Bharat Bhavan to the Statue of Unity, covering a distance of 6 km downstream on the Narmada over 40 minutes. The cruise has two vessels: Unity-1, a two-deck catamaran certified to carry 200 passengers, and which can provide a dinner cruise with a 160-sq-foot performance stage on the upper deck; and Unity-2, a high-speed monohull boat that can carry up to 25 passengers, with a travel time of 25 minutes.
* Dynamic lighting on Sardar Sarovar Dam
Special lights have been put up at the Sardar Sarovar dam 3.5 km from the SoU. There is the Ekta Mall, a two-storey store housing a diverse range of handicraft and traditional items from various Indian states, which has been promoted as a one-stop shop for handicrafts.
How can tourists reach the SoU, and where can they stay?
What is billed as India’s first commercial sea plane service will connect the SoU to the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. Modi rode the flight from Kevadia to Ahmedabad. The service is operated by Spice Jet’s subsidiary Spice Shuttle under the UDAN scheme. The one-way fare is likely to be Rs 1,500.
A ropeway is coming up across the Narmada dam, connecting the two banks of the Narmada river. The proposed ropeway will pass over the Valley of Flowers, Unity Glow Garden, downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam and Cactus Garden and give tourists a panoramic view of the SoU and the Dam reservoir, which is also the meeting point of the three states, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
About 116 houses in 22 villages around the SoU have been identified to make 252 rooms available for tourists wishing to enjoy an experience of a homestay in a tribal village. The spare rooms in homes of families have been renovated for the purpose, which aims to generate income for the host families.

What will be the cost for the tourist?
The entry fee to the SoU will be Rs 150 for adults and Rs 90 for children. To go up to the viewing gallery located at 150 m at the chest of the giant statue, the tickets are Rs 380 for adults and Rs 230 for children. Bookings are available online.
The most expensive attraction on the circuit is river rafting, which costs Rs 1,000 per head.
A full tour package will cost Rs 2,980 for adults and Rs 2,500 for children for a regular visit to the viewing gallery. An express ticket to the viewing gallery, skipping the queue, will cost extra."

The Sardar Patel Zoological Park in Kevadia Colony near the Statue of Unity has lost one more of its zebras, imported from South Africa in October last year. Officials said the zebra developed an intestinal injury — Intussusception — during an aggressive mating session, leading to its death. This is the 10th of the imported exotic animals to have died in the Safari that has not yet been formally inaugurated.
Director of the park, Dr Ram Ratan Nala told this newspaper that the zebra may have suffered the injury during a mating session. Nala said, “The small intestines of the zebra had pushed itself into the large intestines, thus causing a fatal internal rupture. During mating, the zebras get quite aggressive and run around uncontrollably. It could have occurred during that time.” This is the third of the nine imported zebras to have died. The incident occurred on May 13, Nala said. In veterinary parlance, intussusception is caused by many factors, of which, one could be vigorous contractions that force the more proximal intestine to invaginate into the adjacent portion.
In November, four impalas and a giraffe had also died, shortly after their arrival in India from Africa. The authorities had then told The Indian Express that some mortality is expected after transportation. While authorities had confirmed that the impalas died due to accidental injury from high jumps, the giraffe had died of peracute mortality syndrome — a mysterious condition that affects giraffes and causes sudden death without pre-existing evidence of disease or illness.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In January, the second of the four giraffes also died due to the same condition. On March 14, this year, the third of the four giraffes died due to diaphragmatic hernia, thus leaving a lone female giraffe at the safari of the two pairs that were imported by the government.
Nala said that the authorities are on the lookout for a partner for the female, considering the long term need to multiply the numbers. “We have one female giraffe now. We will be coordinating with zoos to see if we have a suitable male partner for the giraffe as part of an exchange programme,” he said, adding that the government plan on bringing in more animals to the safari has not been impacted by the lockdown.
“Zoos are an essential service. So like procurement of food has not been a problem, similarly, paperwork to continue the communication for exchange and procurement of animals is not impacted due to the lockdown. Once the necessary permissions are given, the process will be completed,” said Nala. He, however, did not reveal names of animal species that could possibly be brought in.
The Kevadia zoo, which has not yet been formally inaugurated but has seen a short trial run with tourists visiting, just two weeks before the lockdown was implemented had seen two batches of animals that arrived in October.
With the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown extended until May 31, it is now almost certain that the tourist destinations across the state will remain closed for an indefinite period of time this year.
Gujarat Tourism has introduced virtual tours to several tourist sites through its social media accounts. Last week, it also posted a video of various tourist attractions of Gujarat, urging people to “take a pause” to be able to “meet again”."

On October 31, when the world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, standing 182 metres tall, will be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the tribal population in 15 districts of Gujarat is all set to observe a “black day”. On Thursday, one more tribal-dominated village — Mahupada in Narmada district — passed a resolution in gram sabha declaring that the residents will not take part in any activity related to the Statue of Unity, registering their protest against land acquisition by the government for the project.
Earlier, two more villages — Paat in Sagbara taluka of Narmada district and Vyara in Tapi district — had passed similar resolutions.
The resolution passed by the villages read, “In due time, the Statue of Unity will be inaugurated in Narmada district. For the construction of the project, land belonging to tribal population residing in the area have been acquired. This is unjust for the tribal population. Hence, we resolve that we will not participate in any activities related to the Statue of Unity, be it promotional events like the Ekta Yatra.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The tribal belt from Umargaam to Ambaji, comprising 15 tribal districts and 5,500 tribal villages, have also called a bandh and protest on October 31, which is also the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
“We do not have anything against Sardar Patel. But we feel that had he been alive, he would not have agreed to the construction of such a huge statue at such a huge expense, when the common tribal population across the state is still suffering for basic necessities. No food will be cooked in tribal households, which according to tribal traditions is practised when someone in the family dies,” said Amarsinh Chaudhary, a tribal rights activist who was an MP in the 70s and will be spearheading the movement from Tapi district.
Most of the residents of Paat village, which has a population of around 1,500 and was the first village to pass a resolution on October 15 against the BJP government’s plan to hold a mega event for the unveiling of the statue, have migrated to cities in search of work after their crop yield remained below average due to lack of rainfall and in the absence of any additional water supply for irrigation.
“Activities in the name of development have killed our Narmada river, have killed our men, displaced them, took away their precious land and left them jobless and forcing them to look for work elsewhere. Water is being used to beautify the area ahead of the inauguration but it won’t be used for farmers in Narmada,” said 45-year-old Vinod Vasava, who lives in a two-room kuccha house with a family of five and owns two acres of land. He returned to his village two days ago after working in Surat as a contractual labourer. “Rain was insufficient this year, and we did not get any additional water supply. The produce isn’t enough to sustain the family, so we move out to cities to look for work,” he said.
Villagers claimed that they obstructed the Ekta Yatra, carried out by the BJP, in the run-up to the unveiling of the statue, to pass through their village on Wednesday.

Similar resentment against the government was witnessed among the the tribal population living in and around the Setu Bet, in Waghadia, Limdi and Navagaam villages who have been constantly agitating against the acquisition of land for the various government projects.
On Monday, the state government decided to modify its relief package for the residents of six villages around Kevadia Colony near Narmada dam and seven villages affected by Garudeshwar Weir in Narmada district. As per the latest decision, affected families who want land in return for their land will get land, and those who want money will get Rs 7,50,000 per hectare under the amended relief package.
However, the government’s move has failed to mollify the villagers who outrightly refused to accept such packages.
According to a former village sarpanch, Punabhai Tadvi, 3,500 people from 19 villages were promised jobs, while only 450 benefited ultimately after their lands were acquired for the Sardar Sarovar Dam. “Time and again, we have given up our land for activities that do not hold any benefit to us. Five households were rendered homeless to set up the Shreshta Bharat Bhavan. At least 28 families were displaced for the road widening. Now, they want to build bhavans for every state and they will displace us again. And in return families are only displaced, not rehabilitated,” Tadvi added.
He was referring to the government’s plan to set up bhavans for each state in the proximity of the Statue of Unity."

The plan to construct the 182-metre-high Statue of Unity was announced by Modi on October 2010,but the Sardar Vallabhbhai Rashtriya Ekta Trust,the special purpose vehicle created to carry out the project,only recently hired a US-based consulting agency,Turner Consulting Inc.,for the project.
Modi was supposed to lay the foundation stone of the statue near the dam site on Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and district administration was preparing for his visit in full swing.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) officials said the programme has been postponed temporarily as they could not received confirmation on the date from the CM office.
We had finalised the date on October 2 and were waiting for confirmation from the CM office. We had to cancel the programme as CMO did not confirm the date, managing director,SSNNL,S Jagadeesan,said.
The project is supposed to cost an estimated Rs 2,500-crore,though the consulting agency hired for the project will come out with a revised estimate. The statue will come up at Sadhu Bet,situated at a distance of 3.2 kilometres from Narmada dam.
Narmada district collector PR Sompura said the district administration was preparing for the CM visit at the dam site but stopped it due to last-moment cancellation of the visit. SSNNL authorities had informed us of the CM visit on October 2,but we were later told the visit was cancelled, he said.
Sources said the programme could not be deferred till October 31,Sardar Patels birth anniversary,because election code of conduct might prevent him from laying the foundation stone.
The move to lay foundation stone for the statue assumes importance in the light of the upcoming assembly elections and the current political situation when former CM Keshubhai Patel,who holds significant hold over the Patel community to which Sardar Patel belonged,poses a political challenge to the BJP-led by Modi in the state.

Just specks against the folds of the Statue of Unity’s dhoti, three workers in yellow hard hats and orange fluorescent safety jackets take a lift up 155 metres carrying patterned bronze sheets with buttons moulded on them, to form the structure’s jacket, taking 10 minutes to cover the distance from the ground to the chest. Down below, the other labourers at work are about the size of the statue’s smallest toe, shod in a sandal.
With a little over a month to go for inauguration, “the world’s tallest statue”, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, stands at about 120-130 metres height — minus the head and shoulders, which will together add up to the final 182-metre (597-feet) plan. The ‘182’ number was picked to match the total Assembly constituencies in Gujarat, and will make the Statue of Unity more than double the 93-metre Statue of Liberty, off the coast of New York City. From sea level, the height would be 237.35 metres — the 70-metre hillock of Sadhu Bet having been flattened to 55 metres to lay the foundation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to come for the unveiling on October 31, Sardar Patel’s birthday, and with BJP leaders admitting it could mark the launch of the party’s 2019 Lok Sabha poll campaign, time is of the essence.
Work is on at five major sites that make up the Rs 2,989 crore project. Apart from the statue itself, these include the walkway, the ticket counter, the food court, the four-lane approach highway, the yard where the parts are being assembled, and the Shrestha Bharat Bhavan (a 52-room three-star lodging facility). Altogether, 4,076 labourers are at work, divided into two shifts. Around a thousand of those are working on the cladding of the statue alone, which has been forged in China. They include around 800 locals and about 200 workers from China, who have been working in batches for two-three months each since September 2017.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

With the countdown beginning, three security personnel, two home guards and three State Reserve Police personnel were recently deployed to guard the site, while new checkposts have come up. Right now, no outsider is allowed closer than 250 metres to the Sardar; from there, all you can see is his feet. The statue itself is visible from a 7-km radius, dwarfing a landscape once known for its dam, that ironically fought a long and hard battle to its eventual 163-metre height.
They began with the feet in January 2016, moving on next to the dhoti, the knees and then the shawl flung over the statue’s shoulders, reaching all the way down. This was five years after Modi, then CM of Gujarat, on October 6, 2010, announced such a statue on the occasion of 50 years of formation of the state, to come up on Sadhu Bet hillock in Kevadia Colony, home to the Sardar Sarovar Project on the Narmada river. Modi promised “a world-class statue befitting the stature of the Iron Man of India” — “double the height of Statue of Liberty and four times that of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro”.

A Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust was set up, and soon after Modi became PM in 2014, the Gujarat government handed the construction contract to a multi-firm consortium. L&T was picked as the executing firm, while the consortium includes Michael Graves Architecture & Design and Turner Construction, which previously developed the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5370028 size-full"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/statue-4.jpg"" alt="""" srcset=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/statue-4.jpg 759w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/statue-4.jpg?resize=450,254 450w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/statue-4.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/statue-4.jpg?resize=718,405 718w"" sizes=""(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"" /> Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana
Says an L&T official, “The construction has been done in four stages, including a mock-up, 3D scanning technique as well as a computer numerical control production technique for accurate reproduction of minute details.”
It was on L&T’s recommendation, say officials, that Chinese foundry Jiangxi Tongqing Metal Handicrafts Co. Ltd (or the TQ Art foundry) was chosen to mould the cladding, that essentially makes up the bronze statue. An official who was part of the planning process but has retired since says that in April 2015, a team of engineers visited several foundries in India and abroad before picking TQ Art. “There are a few well-known foundries in India but none has the expertise to cast a bronze statue as tall as this. They are mostly foundries sculpting statues of up to 100-150 feet. This particular Chinese foundry is known for its bronze casts and has several intricate statues to its credit,” the official adds.
What also decided matters in favour of the Jiangxi unit, which is spread over 50,000 sq feet and employs close to 1,000 skilled workmen, was that it was at the time working on what was then the world’s tallest bronze statue. The 62-metre statue has since been installed in China.
“The speed with which they were willing to complete the casting was also a factor,” says the retired official. “The project always had an October 2018 deadline, given the 2019 general elections, and the project could not be delayed by bringing in foundries that were not equipped to handle this kind of project.”
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-5370246 alignleft"" src=""https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/09/iron-man-graph.jpg"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""273"" />The selection of the TQ Art foundry was somewhat of a departure from Modi’s call during his 2014 poll campaign to build the statue from “iron farm tools” collected from across India, to represent the “unified India” that Sardar Patel stood for. This was part of Modi’s Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat slogan, and the movement to collect iron for the statue was compared to the drive to collect bricks for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It was spearheaded by the NGO Citizens for Accountable Governance, mentored by election strategist Prashant Kishor (who has recently joined the JD-U).
On December 15, 2013, Patel’s death anniversary, Modi flagged off 1,000 trucks to travel to seven lakh villages, carrying about three lakh empty kit boxes, to collect soil and the scrap-iron farm implements.

By 2016, 135 metric tonnes of iron had been collected in various forms, but mostly scrap. After much deliberation on the unusable condition of this scrap, about 109 tonnes was used to make the foundation of the statue after undergoing processing.
Officials are tight-lipped about most details regarding the project, and an L&T engineer only lets in reluctantly that the statue will have about 1,850 metric tonnes or 18.5 lakh kilogrammes of bronze cladding in all. The amount of steel and concrete used would be several times more.
This cladding is in the form of 5,000-odd bronze panels, cast by the TQ Art foundry under the watch of the statue’s award-winning designer, Ram V Sutar. These panels were transported over sea and then by road, before being matched and assembled at an off-site workshop in Kevadia Colony.
All the required cladding is now in, and currently, an 8-metre prototype of Patel’s head lies at the workshop, to guide workers in assembling the last set of bronze panels over the next few weeks. Says a top officer, “We have installed a 12-feet statue of Sardar, as well as a 30-feet Patel statue outside the Sachivalaya. But when you make things larger and larger, it is essential to get the features right.”
Among other things. A member of the engineering team working closely with the TQ Art foundry says, “The Chinese workers have been handed out specific instructions on the ‘aura’ the facade should carry. The company was told that as per Sutar’s original design, the statue has to have a poised countenance, with Patel’s head held high and arms by his sides. It should emit a feeling of power as well as warmth. The statue is also supposed to appear as if it is walking on water, towards the Sardar Sarovar dam, with its left leg slightly forward.”

All these specifications, including showing Patel’s legs clad in a dhoti and his feet in sandals, mean the statue is thinner at the base than the top. This is unlike other tall statues, which have a wider base for stability. Besides this, the designers and engineers had to account for the wind factor, given the location and height of the Patel statue, and to factor in the possibility of earthquakes. An official says, “Many times, workers had to pause construction to allow the wind to calm down.”
Officials met this challenge by keeping the slenderness ratio between the top and bottom half of the Patel statue to 16:19 — significantly higher than the 8:14 ratio norm in tall buildings.
A top Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) official says the statue can sustain wind velocity of 220 km/hour and earthquakes measuring up to 6.5 on the Richter Scale, which are at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue.
The statue is located amidst remote, mountainous terrain, which posed another difficulty, in delivery of materials. While most of the stone removed during the levelling of Sadhu Bet hillock was used to support the podium, access to the statue, which is essentially an island, was ensured through two methods. Eight months of the year, the island is accessible from at least one side via land as the water levels recede post monsoon. So a rock bridge was constructed to ensure access over this low level of water, while a Bailey bridge has been built for when water levels are high during the rains. The statue base also stands above the flood level of the nearby Narmada dam.
What helped the engineering teams was the dam itself, a gigantic monument in its own right. Although it is very different in its shape and materials used, its construction showed that high-quality concrete could be mixed and placed in this mountainous region. While the Narmada dam utilises concrete strength of 16 MPa (160 kg/cm2), in the statue’s podium and foundation, concrete strength varies from 40MPa to 65 MPa.
There was another lesson from the Narmada dam that came in handy. Materials required to build the statue pale in comparison to what went into the dam as far as amounts go. And so, officials were confident about transporting materials to the site using trucks, barges and temporary bridges.
Engineering teams first constructed the core wall, the RCC spine of the statue. Steel frames were affixed on this to hold together the bronze cladding, which forms the final facade of the statue. The cladding system is designed to have overlapping panels, allowing for vertical and horizontal movement, to resist earthquake and wind forces. The RCC core has a coupling wall to add rigidity and connect the cores. These concrete cores house the elevators and stairways which are to take visitors right up to the chest height of the statue.
Altogether, the statue is divided into five zones. Up to its shin is the first zone, comprising three levels, including an exhibit floor, mezzanine and roof. It will contain a Memorial Garden and a large museum. The Gujarat government has signed an MoU with the Union Ministry of Culture to secure original letters written by Patel to place in the museum. “The museum will include the timeline of Patel’s life, from his birth in Karamsad to his rise as the Iron Man of India as well as his personal life and attachment to Gujarat. He did extensive flood relief work in the state in 1927. He also rebuilt the Somnath temple, which is very important for Gujarat,” an official says.
Zone 2 extends up to the statue’s thighs at 149 metres, while Zone 3 goes up to the viewing gallery at 157 metres. Zone 4 and Zone 5 would be out of reach of visitors, with Zone 4 comprising the maintenance area and Zone 5 the head and shoulders.
The viewing gallery will be accessible through two elevators located in the statue’s core, with a carrying capacity of 40 people each. While the initial plan was to allow visitors up to the structure’s head and to have a viewing gallery running through the eyes, this was dropped as unfeasible. Says an official, “The wind conditions do not favour a viewing gallery at that height. The chest is the maximum to which visitors can be safely allowed.” The gallery, with space to accommodate up to 200 people at a time, would provide a view of the Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges, which also form the point where Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra meet. Visitors can also get a distant view of the 212-km-long Sardar Sarovar Reservoir, and the 12-km-long Garudeshwar Reservoir — the latter will help ensure there is always water around the statue, which is located downstream from the Narmada dam.
In the lobby area at the entrance of the statue, a Museum and Audio Visual Gallery will feature 15-minute presentations on the life of Patel and the tribal culture of Gujarat, to entertain tourists awaiting their turn to go up. Says an official, “The concept is very similar to Burj Khalifa. There visitors are shown audio-visual presentations on the construction of Burj Khalifa. We have an advantage that the statue is not just a building but a tribute to a great personality.”

Once the statue opens, plans are afoot to have an amphibian bus that can run on both land and water from Kevadiya to the statue site, as well as for a jetty service from the dam site to the statue. SSNNL officials say bids have been invited for a ropeway cable car as another means to reach the statue.
Besides, along the banks of the Narmada, work is on to make a ‘valley of flowers’, notwithstanding the rocky terrain. “We have used artificial soil to cover more than 200 hectares. We are planting perennial plants,” says Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Dr D K Sharma.
Chief Secretary J N Singh, who was the Managing Director of SSNNL when the Statue of Unity was commissioned, and is a member of the trust for its construction, says completing the statue is a matter of pride for the state. “The significance is at two levels. One is that the statue stands for so much that Sardar Patel has given to this country to unify it. On another level, the statue is going to turn around the fortunes of the Narmada district as it will become one of the most important tourist attractions in India, if not the world.”
About the inaugural ceremony on October 31, Singh adds, “It is extremely significant that the foundation was laid by Modiji when he was the Chief Minister, and that he will inaugurate the project now.”
But from Kevadia to Jiangxi, 4,200 km away, everybody associated with the project knows that in the end, it will all come down to the face. And that day is near. Earlier this month, work began on the last few metres, comprising the head and shoulders.
“We have set aside two weeks in the beginning of October to complete the face,” says an L&T official.

State Congress president Siddharth Patel has complained to the state Election Commission that Modis announcement ahead of the municipal and panchayat elections is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct. 
He said a statue of Sardar Patel with a lotus in his hands  as depicted in pictures released to the media  is an insult to the leader.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Minister of State for Small and Medium Entreprises in the UPA government Dinsha Patel said that Modi did not spend a single penny on the Sardar Patel Memorial in Shahibaug in the last nine years of his rule while former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel has given Rs 1.5 crore for the same. 
He said Modis announcement of the 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Patel was more intended to gain political mileage for the BJP candidates in the fray in the municipal and panchayat polls rather than any love for Sardar Patel. 
The BJP has taken strong exception to the Congress opposition to the announcement.
Party spokesmen I K Jadeja and Vijay Rupani said on Thursday that Congress never liked Sardar Patel because it was busy in one family worship. 
Referring to Sardar Patel photographs with a lotus in his hand,they said it was taken after the country had won Independence when the BJP did not exist as a political entity.
They added that it was the BJP-led NDA government which had chipped in with funds to install Sardar Patels statue in the Parliament enclave.

The demand for declaring public holiday on Patel’s birth anniversary was raised by Bundelkhand’s slain dacoit Dadua’s brother and former Samajwadi Party MP Bal Kumar Patel and his son Ram Singh who is an MLA of the ruling party. Both of them met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav Tuesday and handed over their request. After the meeting, Bal Kumar Patel claimed that Akhilesh was willing to declare a public holiday on October 31.
“It was the feeling of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav that it should be done. He asked us to give it in writing. We have submitted our letter in this regard,” Bal Kumar Patel said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The move, if implemented, is expected to affect BJP, which highlights Patel as an icon and even undertook a campaign to construct his statue (Statue of Unity) in Gujarat —- a project that was launched when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of the state. “We are not bothered about BJP’s stand, we have been demanding this for quite some time,” Bal Kumar Patel said.

Akhilesh has already declared six holidays since after he assumed power in 2012. He has declared a holiday on December 6, the death anniversary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar, which was seen as an attempt to appease Dalits. He also declared holiday on the birth anniversary of former PM Chandrashekhar (April 17), Maharishi Kashyap and Maharshi Nishadraj Jayanti (April 5), Hazrat Ajmeri Garib Nawaj Urs (April 26), socialist leader and former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur birth anniversary (June 24) and Maharana Pratap Jayanti (May 9)."

In 2015, the BTP, in alliance with Congress, had managed to establish a hold on two district panchayats in Narmada and Bharuch as well as three taluka panchayats in Dediapada and Sagbara in Narmada district and Netrang in Bharuch district.
Despite backing tribal protests in Narmada against government land acquisition for the development of the Kevadia tourism circuit and the opposition to the eco-sensitive zone status to 121 villages, the BTP found itself struggling to secure votes in all seats.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The BJP, which recorded a landslide win in Narmada district — a Congress bastion in the local body polls, wiped out the Congress and BTP in the district panchayat as well as five taluka panchayats.
Out of 22 Narmada district panchayat seats, BJP won 19 and Congress two and BTP managed to retain one seat. In 2015, Con-gress had 10 and BTP six (as JDU), paving the way for an alliance to take power in the panchayat.
Besides, the BJP wrested power in all five taluka panchayats of Narmada — Tilakwada, Dediapada, Nandod, Sagbara and Garudeshwar. The BJP had been in power only in the Garudeshwar taluka panchayat after the previous polls while the Congress and the BTP had managed to form the board in Dediapada and Sagbara.
The BTP’s election campaign, which stressed on tribal rights and eco-sensitive zones being notified in 121 villages of Garudeshwar and Dediapada talukas, was unable to win a single seat in Garudeshwar and was reduced to two in Dediapada taluka panchayat from 12 seats in 2015. The contest between BJP and BTP candidates was a close one for the Dediapada taluka panchayat seats, the BJP took the cake.
In the Bharuch district panchayat, five-time elected representative Anil Bhagat, who is a close aide of Chhotu Vasava, lost from Walia seat as a BTP candidate. Chhotu’s son Dilip, who contested from Rajpardi seat, also lost. His wife, Varsha, was the sitting president of Jhagadia taluka panchayat. Paresh Vasava, brother-in-law of BTP president Mahesh Vasava, lost from Mouza seat.
BTP president Mahesh Vasava, an MLA from Dediapada, was unavailable for comment but his father and BTP supremo Chhotu Vasava, also an MLA from Jhagadia in Bharuch district told The Indian Express, “We do not accept this result at face value. We are sure the people have voted for us. The BJP has misused the government machinery for its benefits. They distributed election sops and tampered with EVMs… We will approach the High Court with a petition against this result…”
Vasava, who did not venture to campaign due to ill health shot down questions if the BTP suffered due to its tie-up with AIMIM, even as party leaders spoke of it being the reason behind the debacle in hushed tones. He said, “There was no problem with the alliance. We are set to challenge this verdict.”

A senior party functionary of the BTP said, “People turn to the BTP and Chhotubhai to resolve their issues but they did not vote as expected. We will need to introspect… The tribal mindset is such that they consider how much ‘power’ will the party have in resolving their issues. BJP tribal leaders were also against the implementation of the eco-sensitive zone notification and it helped it earn some brownie points.”
The BJP also registered a win in the Kevadia seat of Narmada district panchayat, which consists of six villages around the Statue of Unity area that were protesting the land acquisition by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) in Kevadia, Vaghadia, Limdi, Gora, Navagam and Kothi in May 2020.
Despite the opposition of the affected villages, BJP candidate Dinesh Tadvi — who was leading the protests earlier — won by 82 votes, beating the Congress candidate Ranjitsinh Tadvi, son of sitting district panchayat member Dilip Jesinh Tadvi.
In the Bharuch district panchayat, five-time elected representative Anil Bhagat, who is a close aide of Chhotu Vasava, lost from Walia seat as a BTP candidate. Chhotu’s son Dilip, who contested from Rajpardi seat, also lost — his wife, Varsha, was the sitting president of Jhagadia taluka panchayat. Paresh Vasava, the brother-in-law of BTP president Mahesh Vasava, lost from Mouza seat.
Paresh Vasava was sitting chairman of Agricultural produce cooperative of the Bharuch District Panchayat as well as part of the irrigation committee while Bhagat was the vice-president of Bharuch district panchayat that ended its term in December, and also the chairman of the executive committee.
In 2015, the JD(U) and Congress seized power in Bharuch district panchayat as an alliance with JD(U) getting nine seats and Congress 13 — the tally was reduced to three and four, respectively, on Monday. Similarly, in three taluka panchayat Walia, Jhagadia and Netrang, JD(U) candidates won with full majority. The JD(U) was in power in the Jhagadia taluka panchayat for three consecutive terms.
Bhagat told this newspaper, “This time our performance was not good. People have not voted for us. We are analysing the factors responsible for our candidates’ defeat."

Krishnam, who said that he would have just one election slogan – Nafarat haaregi, Mohabbat jitegi (Hatred will fail, love will win), also said that the BJP that had mandir on its agenda when it came to power in the state and the Centre forgot temples after coming to power.

“Jeetne ke baad main sabse pehle Atal Bihari Vajpayee ki moorti lagane ki ghoshna karta hun,” Krishnam told The Indian Express. He further said, “It would send a message on how the BJP has neglected Atal.

Mocking Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his recent temple visits in poll-bound Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said a person who has never lifted a “puja ki thali” was now applying big tilak and wearing garlands. Addressing a public gathering in Bharuch on the last day of BJP’s Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, Chouhan said “mafia raj” prevailed during Congress’s rule in Gujarat, but under subsequent BJP governments the state has witnessed long-lasting peace.
“Now, Rahulbaba is visiting Gujarat often because elections are near. He is also offering prayers at various temples…(a person) who has never lifted a puja ki thali is applying big tilak and wearing big garlands, without having knowledge about the great culture of this country, otherwise, he would not have commented on women (in RSS),” Chouhan told the public gathering after offering prayers at a Sai temple here. The Madhya Pradesh CM was referring to the Congress leader’s recent comment that he had not seen “a single woman in an RSS shakha wearing shorts”.
Chouhan also reminded people that Gujarat used in remain under curfew for “half the year” during Congress regime and “mafias were running the government”. He said Gujarat has become a peaceful state during BJP rule for over 22 years. He also accused Congress of “neglecting” Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Addressing a gathering in Ankleshwar, Chouhan alleged that the issue of Jammu & Kashmir has remained unresolved since Independence, because first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru kept the issue with himself and did not assign it to Sardar Patel (who was then the home minister).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said, “They (Congress) conferred Bharat Ratna on Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, but ignored Sardar Patel for many years… Almost after 40 years of his death, he (Sardar) was conferred Bharat Ratna.” He then congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Statue of Unity project to honour Sardar Patel. “I want to remember three great sons of this land (Gujarat) — Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel without whom it was impossible to unite India, and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is tirelessly working to make India a superpower.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Also, reacting to the ongoing social media campaign Vikas Gando Thayo Che, mocking the development claims of the BJP government, Chouhan said, “One needs vision and intelligence to see the development which is everywhere in Gujarat.” “Gujarat is the role model of development… here development is every where. Congress was thinking that they will win the election by just giving slogans and allurements, but after seeing development on the ground they are… defaming development, but for us development was agenda and it will remain so,” he said. Chouhan during the Yatra was joined by Union minister Parshottam Rupala and Gujarat MoS Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja."

The release stated, “Tickets will be provided in two-hour slots through the website. Entry will be allowed to tourists only in the slot for which the tickets have been purchased. No tickets will be issued physically from any ticket window.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The release added that wearing masks, using sanitisers and undergoing thermal scanning will be mandatory for tourists who will also have to practise discipline. “Sitting arrangements have also been made to maintain social distancing in the hop-on, hop-off buses,” the release further said.
Officials of the SoU administration said that the lockdown period was utilised to construct more stops for the hop-on and hop-off bus service so as to prevent crowding at a single bus stand. In August this year, as part of the preparation for SoU’s reopening, CISF personnel were deployed at the complex for smooth management of the crowd."

The report was submitted to the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNL) authorities.
The state government had recently decided to erect a statue of Sardar Patel,which is proposed to be the worlds tallest statue.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
As a preliminary step,various agencies were tasked with model survey,hydrological survey,seismic survey,wind analysis etc.
Professors of the Applied Mechanics Department at SVNIT had carried out geotechnical and geological surveys for the proposed structure,which is located near Sardar Sarovar dam site.
The SVNIT team had visited the location and dug up a few bore wells up to 40 meter in depth. As per the plan,over 30 bore wells are required to be dug in that area.
The experts collected samples of rocks,which were later sent to the laboratory for pressure meter test,infiltration test,load bearing test etc.,following which the team sent its interim report to the SSNL authorities,stating that the load-bearing capacity of rocks for the proposed structure would not be enough because of the inclined pattern of rocks.
Professor B J Metha said,It is difficult,but everything could be controlled. Some artificial confinement should be used to stop the displacement of rocks and increase the load-bearing capacity of the proposed structure. There are various methods which can be implemented to make the dream project successful. Model testing of the proposed structure is being carried out by an agency based at Khadakvasla in Pune.
Engineers of the Samsung Corporation of South Korea,who have the Al Burj Hotel of Dubai to their credit,also examined the Sadhu Bet location. The engineers too presented a similar conclusion as the SVNIT team report.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(Representative Image)
The Rajpipla police in Narmada, on Saturday, detained as many as 18 Congress leaders including eight MLAs on their way to protest against the ongoing land acquisition process by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) in six villages surrounding the Statue of Unity (SoU).
Among those detained was Congress MLA P D Vasava from Nandod taluka of Narmada, where SoU is located, who led the leaders to the office of the District Collector of Narmada and submitted a memorandum against the ongoing acquisition.
Narmada Superintendent of Police Himkar Singh confirmed that the police detained the Congress leaders while they were on their way to join a local tribal protest at Kevadia colony, where the SSNNL has begun the fencing of open farm lands belonging to locals after the Gujarat High Court, earlier this month, dismissed a PIL filed before it by activists backing the tribals last year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The contention of the villagers of Limbdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora is that the SSNNL had sought the land acquisition 60 years ago for the building of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but is now intending to put the land to use for other commercial purposes and not for the dam, which is why the SSNNL claim on it should be invalidated.
The detention of the Congress leaders comes three days after about 18 other local tribals were detained and released for stalling the fencing work in the villages. The detained MLAs apart from Vasava included Anil Joshiyara from Bhiloda in Aravalli, Chandrika Baria from Garbada in Dahod, Puna Gamit from Vyara in Tapi, Sunil Gamit from Nizar in Tapi, Anand Chaudhary from Mandvi in Surat, Sukhram Rathwa from Pavi Jetpur in Chhota Udepur district.
Earlier, the leaders submitted a memorandum to the Narmada collector, seeking answers to the permission given to carry out fencing during the ongoing lockdown. “We request the government to let the land stay with the villagers for now and carry out acquisition only under the Land Acquisition Act after resolving the matter by taking locals into confidence. The district administration and police should stop treating locals inhumanely and subjecting them to atrocity,” the memorandum read.
SP Himkar Singh said that no villagers were being forced to leave their homes. “We have already clarified that the detention of the tribals three days ago was only because they were protesting the ongoing work, which is as per high court order of earlier this month. No one was assaulted. It is natural that when there is a protest, the protestors will not voluntarily enter into a police van and therefore they have to be forcefully taken in. The Congress leaders as well did not have the permission to gather in such numbers for a physical protest during the ongoing lockdown. In both the cases, the police detained and release the protestors within about two hours.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
In a statement on Saturday state Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja accused the Congress of “misleading and inciting tribals” over the issue of land acquisition. Jadeja said, “The fencing is being carried on in accordance with the permission granted by the Gujarat High Court, which has lifted the status quo due to the hearing of the PIL that was ongoing. The Gujarat government through SSNNL is determined to offer a commensurate compensation package to the villagers for their lands. The same has been put forth before the Gujarat High Court and we will fulfill our commitment once the lockdown is eased further. Even if we have to relocate the tribals to their original lands for their good, we will do it. The tribals are aware that the Statue of Unity has created employment opportunity for them but the Congress is trying to instigate and distract them from development for their political gains.”"

While the Congress claimed that the deaths were influenced by rotting cattle meat that illegally makes its way into Gir from the peripheral villages, the state government defended saying that the population of these carnivores have risen by 29 per cent in the past five years.
Of the total number of Asiatic lions that perished between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020, a majority 152 were cubs, 90 were lionesses and the remaining 71 were male lions, forest minister Ganpat Vasava said in reply to a question by Congress MLA from Lathi, Virji Thummar.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“One of the reasons for the death of lions is that dead cattle is brought inside the Gir sanctuary as feed. The lions eat this rotten flesh and die and their deaths are considered natural,” Thummar claimed adding that if the forest department do not stop this practice, then deaths of lions will continue to rise.
Gir, which is the last remaining abode of Asiatic Lions in the world, currently has 674 lions as per a survey conducted by the forest department. “When the enumeration of lions were carried out in 2015, there were 523 lions and when the exercise was carried out again in 2020, there were 674 lions which means there was a 29 per cent increase in population in five years,” Vasava said adding that the state government will take strict action if they get any complaints of dead cattle being given inside the sanctuary.
The forest minister said that the state government has spent Rs 33 crore in making parapets for 43,000 open wells to prevent lions from falling into them. He said the government has started four lion ambulances which is equipped with anaesthesia-cum-ventilator, multiparameters monitor, blood analyser,
centrifugal machine and ultrasound machine.
“We have set up CCTV cameras to prevent unauthorised entry into the sanctuary. There are 12 hospitals for lions, nine doctors and as the territory of lions have grown, we have established a new Shetrunji division of the sanctuary. This BJP government is determined to protect the lions,” Vasava said.
During discussion on the subject, Thummar alleged that about 25 Asiatic Lions were given to zoos outside the state. The minister in his reply said that the lions which were sent to zoos in other states were captive lions from Sakkarbaugh Zoo of Junagadh. “No wild lions have been given to other states,” Vasava added.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Thummar said, “The meat of dead cattle makes its way to the sanctuary illegally and the lions fall ill and die after eating it.”
In reply to a separate question by Congress MLA from Junagadh, Bikhabhai Joshi, about the number of animals sent to other zoos from Sakkarbaugh, the state government in a written reply stated that in the past two years, 25 lions have been sent to zoos in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Seven Asiatic Lions were sent to Itawa Safari Park in Uttar Pradesh during this period.
The state government also said that it had sent 88 birds and animals, including lions and leopards, from Sakkarbaug to the new Sardar Patel Zoological Park at Kevadia, near the Statue of Unity.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
In response to another question asked by Congress MLA from Taltala, Bhagabhai Barad, the state government in a written reply said Rs 108.23 crore has been allocated for the Gir sanctuary by both the Centre and the state government in two years ending December 2020. Of this, Rs 95.38 crore was given by Gujarat, while the Centre gave Rs 12.85 crore."

A birthday party in the state gave Congress leaders an opportunity to come down heavily on Chief Minister Narendra Modi. On November 26,senior Congress leader and Union Minister of State Bharatsinh Solanki celebrated his 61st birthday in Anand in the presence of Congress leaders,including Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly Shankarsinh Vaghela and workers,among others. The occasion provided a good platform to Solanki and Vaghela to launch a tirade against Modi. They targeted the CM and the BJP on a range of issues,like allegedly selling off the government land to industrial houses,illegal snooping on a young woman,construction of Statue of Unity,2002 riots,fake encounters and Modis alleged attempts to hijack and claim the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Solanki and Vaghela even garlanded a statue of Patel in Anand on the occasion. The local Congress workers also did not miss a chance: they claimed to have enrolled 1,000 youths in the Congress party and gave the enrolment forms as a birthday gift to Solanki. 
Critically,yours
At the first Users Meet and Awareness Programme,organised by Ahmedabads Meteorological Department recently,participants from various state organisations shared their suggestions and experiences. However,one of the participants left the panel tongue-tied when he stated that the weather forecast of a 90-year-old man,based on astrology,was more accurate and reliable than the scientific forecast by the Met Department. The audience guffawed at the remark and also nodded in agreement,which left the panel even more embarrassed. Taking control of the situation,the regional director of Met Department,Jayanta Sarkar,sportingly responded,We accept criticism gracefully.

The makers of an upcoming Gujarati film have announced a special press meet to launch their film. The meet will be addressed solely by the director of the film,a popular city-based radio jockey-turned filmmaker. He is credited with bringing back the comedy genre in the Gujarati film industry. He tasted success with his very first film,that explored the eternal Gujarati dream of going to the US. With the buzz around  his second film,it surely looks like the director has a lot riding on his upcoming production. Interestingly,Gujarati film budgets recently crossed the one crore club. Gujarati cinema is the flavour of the season with The Good Road having made it to Oscars as Indias official entry. It will be interesting to see if the latest Gujarati flick can be a game-changer for the industry.
Shale Shock
The dedication ceremony of the countrys first shale gas-exploratory well in Jambusar in South Gujarat was surprisingly a low-key affair. The event,presided over by none other than Union Petroleum minister M Veerappa Moily and attended by a select group of very senior ONGC officials,saw Moily give a speech on economic independence through shale gas discoveries to an audience that comprised employees from Ankleshwar asset of the ONGC. The locals were kept away from this event of national importance. Moily himself acknowledged the humbleness of the event that was meant to kickstart the search of a huge quantum of oil & gas trapped in shale formations across the country that could meet the countrys energy demand for 26 long years. Not too keen to grab headlines,Moily even dismissed a question posed by a mediaperson on snooping scandal,involving former Gujarat Home Minister. No political questions please, he quipped.
SU ethics panel gets DCGI registration
RAJKOT:  The ethics committee,formed by Saurashtra University for overseeing clinical research,has been granted registration by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI),New Delhi,making it the only committee of its kind set up by an educational institute in the state.  The committee has been formed by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences (DoPS) of SU. It had applied with the DCGI in February,seeking registration for conducting clinical research to test the efficacy and safety of modified drugs. The DCGI,which controls drug standards in the country,granted application of DoPS last week and issued registration to the committee for three years. While the clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy and effects of a newly discovered drug molecule,clinical research is required to test the effectiveness of change in formulation of the drug,like turning a suspension into tablet.
Around 600 ceramic making units shut down indefinitely
RAJKOT: Wheels of around 600 manufacturing units of ceramic products in Morbi came to a grinding halt as the industry associations started their indefinite shut-down in protest against high gas prices and taxes.
Even as GSPC Gas,a state-owned firm that supplies piped natural gas to ceramic industry in Morbi reduced gas prices by Rs 2 per standard cubic metre,the industry associations went ahead with their decision to enforce a shut-down from the wee hours of Thursday,terming the reduction too little.
The 412 large units and around 200 small units remained shut throughout the day with around 2 lakh workers finding themselves jobless.  Members of the four industry associations held a meeting late in the evening and decided to continue their strike until the government fulfils their demands. Members of the associations have decided to continue with the strike until their five-point demand is met. They have decided that dispatch of ceramic products will also be discontinued from December 3 onwards, Hitesh Patel,a spokesperson for the associations said.
The associations are demanding PNG at Rs 25 per SCM. They are also seeking permission to operate coal gasification plants that meet pollution norms. Their third demand is that VAT should be reduced to five per cent instead of the current rate of 15 per cent. They are also demanding the excise duty to be brought down from 12.36 per cent to 6 per cent to bring ceramic products at par with other construction material. They are also demanding re-imposition of 150 per cent anti-dumping duty on ceramic products imported from China,which the Centre had abolished six months ago.

The government officials and ministers will fan out across India to collect iron pieces from farmers for building the 182-metre statue even as Sardar Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust,headed by Modi,will raise Rs 2,000 crore for the project. But the farmers,even after four decades of 
SSD project,remain deprived of Narmada water for irrigation. Recently,Modi,underlining the fact that only 7.17 lakh hectares of the total 18.45 lakh hectares command area of minor canal network is being irrigated,had asked centre to provide the fund to accelerate the project.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to Sardar Sarovar Nigam Limited (SSNL) records,as of now 37,841.08-long km of sub- minor canal network,which will supply water to farms from main canal,is still pending. The total length of sub-minor canals network runs into 48,058 km. That means so far only 10,216 km of the network is being completed. 
The work on minor canals,too,is moving at snails pace. Of the total 18,413 km long network,so far 7,620 km long pipeline have been laid even as work on the remaining 10,792 km is pending. Of the total 5,112 km of sub-branch canals,only 2719.95 km has been completed.  
The delay has mostly been caused by lack of fund. The Modi government wants the Centre to give it 90 per cent financial assistance under the Accelerated Irrigation benefit program. In August,Modi wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to consider the Desert Development Program (DDP) as per Drought Prone Area Program (DPAP). He said in the letter dated August 3,Ninety per cent DDP grant will help the state to further proceed with building minor pipeline network,which so far covers command area of 7.19 lakh hectares of the total 18.45 hectares.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Given the speed at which the work on sub-minor and minor canal is going on,it may take another decade to complete the project, said an official from Gujarat irrigation department. In 2011-2012,only 10.42 km work of sub-minor canal was done,followed by 36.60 km in the previous financial year. The work of minor canal,however,gained some acceleration from 2012-2013 which saw the network of 1,468 km bring laid,followed by 789 km so far in this financial year."

(Source: ANI)
On the occasion of Sardar Patel’s 144th birth anniversary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday dedicated the decision to abrogate the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution “at the feet” of the country’s first home minister.
“I dedicate the August 5 decision of abrogation of Article 370 to Sardar Vallabhai Patel on his birthday today. We are lucky that we could fulfil his incomplete dreams. Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir are now marching towards development and prosperity,” Modi said while addressing a gathering at the Statue of Unity in Gujarat’s Kevadiya.

The Prime Minister further said Jammu and Kashmir was the only state with Article 370 where terrorism killed more than 40,000 people in the past decades. “We were divided by a wall. But, Sardar Patel’s dream is now fulfilled, the wall has been demolished by us,” he added. Follow LIVE updates here
The bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh came into effect today with immediate events including LGs, top bureaucrats, police chiefs taking charge. Beyond the symbolic importance — the birth anniversary of Patel — the day will mark the beginning of the functioning of the two UTs at a bureaucratic level.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Centuries ago India was united by Chanakya, and after that Patel achieved the same feat by merging princely states with the Union of India, the Prime Minister added.
In an apparent jibe at Pakistan, PM Modi said, “those who cannot win wars against us are trying to threaten and challenge our unity, but they forget that despite decades of similar attempts no one could ever accomplish to harm our unity.”
“Together, we have to fight forces which are trying to threaten our unity. This will be a true tribute to Sardar Vallabhai Patel,” he added.
Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary is celebrated as `Rashtriya Ekta Diwas’ (National Unity Day) since 2014.  During the function, the Prime Minister offered floral tributes at the Statue of Unity, considered to be the world’s tallest statue, as flower petals were showered on it from above by an Indian Air Force helicopter."

Ahead of the 2019 polls, fake news on social media, “urban Naxals”, incidents of lynching, illegal migrants, the revival of Khalistan militancy in Punjab, and Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) will dominate this year’s annual Directors-General of Police (DGP) conference, scheduled for December 20-22 at the recently inaugurated Statue of Unity in Gujarat, officials said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and NSA Ajit Doval will also be present during the event.
Other agendas being finalised by the Intelligence Bureau (IB), in consultation with states’ police, includes internal security, insurgency in the Northeast, new-age issues such as encryption, cyber stalking, and faster resolution of cyber crime complaints, and Left- wing extremism (LWE).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
During the three-day discussion, a session on erosion of police credibility is being planned, in order to address the growing insensitivity among the law enforcement agencies, officials added.
A review of pending recommendations from the previous conferences was held by Singh on Monday, where it was learnt that several of these directions were only present on paper but no action had been taken by states.
Some of these recommendations include focus on regular patrolling and intelligence gathering by the constabulary, use of cyber space, Aadhaar and finger prints to advantage, persuading children to attend school, and for parents to participate in the pulse polio programme.
A threadbare analysis of incidents of lynching, the role of policemen, and its consequence is also likely to be taken up in one of the sessions.
Top police officers from Punjab and adjoining states will also take up issues related to revival of Khalistan militancy in Punjab. Chief minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh has raised the issue on several occasions, citing intelligence reports that Pakistan’s ISI may be behind it.
Among other issues likely to be taken up for discussion in closed-door meetings will be sharp rise in infiltration by militants from across the border, and how to financially choke the resources of militant groups like LeT and JeM with international cooperation, officials added.
A case study on the recent success against Islamic State (IS) is also likely to be shared by states like Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala.Delhi NewsCurbs on dine-in till April 30 will cripple industry, say restaurantsSurge in Covid patients, colleagues testing positive: Across Delhi hospitals, doctors and nurses face burnoutDelhi High Court allows 50 people to perform namaz at Markaz mosqueClick here for more
Officials said North Block had proposed Port Blair in Andaman and Nicobar, and Ladakh as alternate venues for this year’s meet. However, South Block suggested Sardar Patel’s Statue of Unity, following which the decision was taken — Patel is credited with the setting up of a training institute in Hyderabad for IPS officers."

Amid confusion over where the reptiles would be released, the Gujarat Forest Department has started evacuating crocodiles from two ponds on the Sardar Sarovar Dam premises on the Narmada, to make way for the seaplane service planned to promote tourism at the Statue of Unity.
Until last Tuesday, 15 crocodiles had been evacuated. There are roughly 500 of them in the two ponds located adjacent to each other on the dam premises. The mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) in the Narmada fall under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, which covers the most endangered species.
A multi-level committee comprising officials of the Civil Aviation Department and Gujarat government had cleared Pond 3, locally called ‘Magar talav (crocodile pond)’, for setting up the seaplane terminal, to connect cities of Gujarat to the Sardar Patel statue site.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Using fish as bait to lure them into cages, the Forest Department has started removing the crocodiles, the largest of them so far about 10 feet. There is no deadline as of now for finishing the operation.
Dr K Sasi Kumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Narmada, said, “We are rescuing the crocodiles from Ponds 3 and 4, which are close to the site. We have put 10 teams of officials for the exercise.” For about a week, the crocodiles were in the custody of the Forest Department. Then, after considering the possibility of releasing them in their natural habitat, it was decided to let them out into the reservoir of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam. “That’s where most of them will be released,” Kumar said.
Questioning this, a top official of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), who refused to be named, said, “For many years now, the Forest Department has been releasing crocodiles into the reservoir of the dam, apart from the main canal, the Ajwa reservoir and other canals. This particular exercise involves hundreds of crocodiles. It may not be possible to release all into the reservoir in one go. They will have to be distributed in other places as well. It is most likely that a lot of these crocodiles could end up going back closer to the human habitats from where they were once rescued and brought to the Narmada.”
Crocodiles captured from human settlements during the monsoon are released into the Narmada dam ponds as a practice. Ajwa reservoir closer to Vadodara is already home to hundreds of crocodiles.
Dr Jitendra Gavali, Director, Community Science Centre, Vadodara, called the transfer of reptiles in such large numbers for making a seaplane terminal “against the principles of the Wildlife Protection Act”. Warning that the crocodiles may be harmed, he pointed out that firstly officials can’t be sure of their exact number in the ponds. “Moreover releasing them into the dam reservoir would mean that the female crocodiles may not be able to nest if the slope of the dam is more than about 40 degrees. Crocodiles need space on land to nest and also to come out of the waters during winters… If the government has spent crores of rupees making the Statue of Unity, it should spend some more money to make an artificial pond for landing the seaplanes without disturbing the ecological balance and natural habitat of crocodiles.”
A feasibility report on the seaplane service had been prepared in the run-up to the inauguration of the Statue of Unity, in October last year, by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Department of Civil Aviation. The Centre had promised this service in the state, with Prime Minister Narendra travelling in a seaplane from Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad to Dharoi Dam in Ambaji in December 2017, marking the end of his campaign for the Gujarat Assembly polls.
Eventually, the rocky-bed Pond 3, officially called Panchmuli lake, had been identified as ideal to build the seaplane terminal. An SSNNL official said, “Pond 3 has a vast body, making it perfect. The Civil Aviation team also liked the site. It will take care of the operations.” A seaplane requires a water body of minimum 900-metres width and 6-feet depth to land.
Incidentally, Pond 3, which is the biggest of the four lakes around the Sardar Sarovar Dam and boasts of a scenic view, was once open to boating. But this ended in 2013, when a boat with about 60 tourists got stranded in the waters and was surrounded by crocodiles, spreading much panic. It took a couple of hours to rescue the tourists.
The other sites shortlisted for development of water aerodromes in Gujarat are Palitana and Dharoi Dam. Officials said the Civil Aviation Ministry was also contemplating classifying the operations under the Udan initiative for regional connectivity.
An official of the Gujarat Tourism Department said, “Tourism in Narmada has received a big boost due to the Statue of Unity and aerodrome services will come as an added advantage.”"

‘High alert’ was sounded in Gujarat and security beefed up at several places, including Statue of Unity and Somnath Temple, on Tuesday as news broke of the pre-dawn strike on terror camps in Pakistan by the Indian Air Force (IAF).
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was also shot down near Nundhatal village in Abdasa taluka of border district Kutch on Tuesday.
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani chaired a high-level meeting to review the security situation as the state shares both land and sea border with the neighbouring country. “The Army, IAF, BSF, Coast Guard, local police and all security establishments are coordinating with each other. They are on vigil and all arrangements have been made (for security)… We are ready to counter any situation,” he said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Earlier in the day, Director General of Police Shivanand Jha cancelled a conference on crime-related issues scheduled at the Police Bhavan in Gandhinagar, and asked all officers, who reached here to attend it, to return to their respective headquarters in view of the alert sounded in the state. In an order issued by the police headquarters, all the district superintendents of police and inspector generals of different ranges were told to stay put at their respective headquarters.
“It was the most obvious thing to do since Pakistan would try to retaliate. Since we share land as well water borders, we have told our officers to be cautious,” said a senior officer in Gandhinagar.
The officer added that security was already been heightened in view of the attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama on February 14.
Meanwhile, police in Kutch said that a UAV was shot down by the IAF early Tuesday morning and its debris fell in an open field near Nundhata village which is under the jurisdiction of Kothara police station. While media reports suggested that the UAV was a Pakistani drone, local police said they had no such confirmation. “We can confirm that the incident has happened. My police team has visited the site. But the Air Force has removed the debris from the site. We cannot confirm what the object was and to whom it belonged,” D B Vaghela, Inspector General (Border Range), Gujarat Police, told The Indian Express.
The IG said that the debris fell in an open field and nobody was injured in the incident."

(Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)
Clad in grey trousers, waist coat and a pink shirt and kurta, a group of 60 young guides were scattered across the integrated complex of the Statue of Unity (SoU) to help the tourists understand the engineering behind the world’s tallest statue and the life of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. With just two days since the inauguration, they are yet to be assigned specific locations, but yet they ensure they remain available to the crowd flocking the site.
The 60 young guides are a mixed group from the districts of Narmada (37), Chhota Udepur (14), Bharuch (4), Vadodara (2), Surendranagar (1), Kheda (1) and Dahod (1), of whom 46 are men and 14 women. In the group are 11 post graduates, 15 undergraduates and 34 graduates.
Many gave up other careers to become professional guides and will be paid a stipend of Rs 15,000 per month for six months.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Mayursinh Raul, 33, was formerly working as a customer service executive with HDFC financial services and is now a guide at SoU. The one anecdote that stuck from Sardar Patel’s life from their training session, says Raul, “is when it was time to choose the first Prime Minister of the nation, Sardar Patel could have become the first Prime Minister as he had the maximum votes in his name. However the (Congress) working committee pushed the name of Jawahar Lal Nehru. At that time, Mahatma Gandhi had given a chit to Sardar Patel and after reading it he decided to opt out of the race. We don’t know what the chit had, but for someone who could have become independent India’s first Prime Minister he chose not to, simply out of respect for the Mahatma. This shows that for him his principles mattered and not power.”
The guides will tell you how “The auditorium is built at a height of 25 m and a museum has been built within the auditorium. There are lifts to take you to the viewing gallery from where you can see the Sardar Sarovar Dam. Between the dam and the Garudeshwar weir is a distance of 12 km which will be filled with water…”
When The Indian Express team went up to the viewing gallery at 157 metres from the ground level, there were no guides there. A sculpture of Sardar Patel’s face welcomes you as one enters the auditorium. The actual face of the statue is five times this prototype. Before one boards the lift that takes, one passes through a gallery featuring photographs of major moments Sardar Patel’s life. Two lifts take the tourists to the viewing gallery with a capacity of 26 people. The first stop is on the fourth floor, which can be accessed by a flight of stairs and escalators, where the feet of the statue begins.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The guides were recruited in a two-step selection process – shortlisting of candidates based on applications and an interview, which was conducted on September 12. After a month-long training, they undertook a test to check their efficiency."

His “disclosure” comes at a time when the BJP is making extra attempts to shed its image of a north Indian party for Hindi-speaking people in the state. Attempts to connect with the Tamil language and culture is a significant part of its campaign strategy in Tamil Nadu, where it is fighting the assembly elections in alliance with ruling AIADMK. While party president J P Nadda during his last visit urged his state cadre to see that all party literature is made in Tamil, Union minister Rajnath Singh recently surprised his crowd with Tamil dialogues in his speech in Salem. In his Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, Modi not only expressed regret for not learning Tamil, he said he has been told by many about the depth and vivaciousness of its literature.
The Guide
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS Minister S Jaishankar, who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, on Sunday recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi — while speaking on languages in Mann Ki Baat — shared an interesting audio clip. A tour guide at Statue of Unity in Gujarat was talking about the tallest statue of Sardar Patel in the world – in Sanskrit. “Happy to know that there are over 15 Sanskrit guides in Kevadiya,” he said.
Fresh Faces
ON A day the leaders of the G 23, the group of leaders who are seeking reforms in the Congress, appeared on one stage in Jammu in what is being seen as a show of strength, the Congress made an interesting appointment. It made R S Bali, the son of veteran Himachal Pradesh Congress leader G S Bali, an AICC secretary. Bali is one of the prominent Brahmin faces of the Congress from Himachal and so is Anand Sharma, who is one of the prominent faces among the G 23 leaders. The party had earlier made another Brahmin leader Sudhir Sharma an AICC secretary. Sudhir is close to former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. Many of the party leaders are now reading between the lines on the elevation of yet another Brahmin leader from Himachal Pradesh. They are wondering whether the party is creating a new Brahmin leadership in the state."

(Express )
BJP leaders on Wednesday put up a united face as Geeta Rathwa filed her nomination for the Chhota Udepur Lok Sabha seat, despite several of them being disgruntled at the party picking her over leaders such as sitting MP Ramsinh Rathwa and district president Jashu Rathwa as well as Jetpur MLA Jayanti Rathwa, who had also deemed himself a strong candidate.
Sources said that state BJP president Jitu Vaghani reprimanded Ramsinh Rathwa, who had openly made his displeasure known at having been dropped for the upcoming polls, as well as Jayanti Rathwa, who had made anti-party statements and announced earlier that he would file his nomination as an independent candidate.
Falling in line, Ramsinh Rathwa and Jayanti Rathwa in fact flanked the candidate as she filed her nomination at the office of the District Electoral Officer (DEO).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who was to have kicked off a road show in support of Geeta enroute to the DEO’s office, however skipped the rally, making just a brief visit to address a public gathering.
Major preparations had been made for the chief minister’s presence at the rally, which was deemed crucial in the constituency where the Statue of Unity stands in Nandod taluka. However, it was Vaghani who led the road show and accompanied Geeta to the DEO’s office to file her nomination.
Rupani, whose speech was expected to boost the sagging morale of cadres that are disappointed by the party’s choice of candidate, stuck to his recent comparison of the election to a war with Pakistan.
Rupani mentioned Pakistan nine times in his 24-minute long speech and said, “This election is between India and Pakistan because it is Narendrabhai Modi who has given a fitting reply to Pakistan
after all these years of suffering terrorism. This is an election between chowkidars and chors, who are in connivance
with Pakistan.”
Vaghani in his address to a crowd of mostly party workers stressed on the need for them to be united and not pay heed to the reports of division among cadres. “We have to win this seat and gift it to Narendra bhai (Modi), who is going to become the PM for the second term and change the fortunes of India,” he said.
Geeta, who has been a member of the District Panchayat of Chhota Udepur for the past five terms (including when the district was part of Vadodara until 2013), is the first fresh face fielded by the BJP for the seat since 1991.
In her affidavit, Geeta has identified herself as a homemaker without any monthly income. She has declared that she possesses cash of Rs 18,000, jewellery worth Rs 6 lakh, including Rs 4.9 lakh gold and Rs 90,000, given by her parents at the time of her wedding.
Geeta, who is the wife of BJP district Vice President Vajesinh Rathwa, however, has declared that her husband has assets worth Rs 80 lakh, including immovable property worth Rs 42 lakh.
Educated till the higher secondary level of schooling, Geeta joined the party in 1995 and went to become the president of BJP Mahila Morcha of Kawant in 1998, a post to which she was re-elected repeatedly till 2004. From 2004 to 2007 she served as vice president of the Mahila Morcha. She has served as chairman of the district panchayat of Vadodara in 2013-14, of the district panchayat health committee in 2011-13 and of the child development department of the district in 2014-15."

Last month, BTP had ended its alliance with Congress in two district panchayats in the state after the latter ditched it and supported BJP in the recently concluded panchayat elections in Rajasthan.
Mahesh Vasava, national president of BTP, had called up AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi and proposed to form a coalition with the party in Gujarat for the upcoming local body polls.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Addressing media persons after the meeting, Chhotu Vasava said, “Our country got independence, but SC, St and OBC communities have not got independence till date. We have earlier made alliance with Congress and BJP, but none of them had done any work for the development of tribals. Owaisi is fighting for the constitutional rights in the country. So we have decided to support them.”
“The land of tribals in 17 villages was snatched away by BJP in Statue of Unity project. Our slogans for upcoming elections will be BJP and Congress-free Gujarat. We will carry out discussion with the AIMIM president regarding seats sharing,” Vasava added.
AIMIM MP from Aurangabad Saiyed Imtiyaz Jaleel said, “It was an age-old demand of the people, especially youths, of Gujarat that AIMIM should come to state politics. Time has come and we have reached here to meet BTP for alliance. Both the party chiefs have decided to fight upcoming local polls together.”

He added that the party is “not limited to one caste or religion.” “We will share friendly relations with all castes and religions, especially tribals, Muslims and SC/ST and OBC communities who are left behind in politics,” Jaleel said."

The last time Modi and Advani were together,after the former was named the PM candidate,was on October 16 at the inauguration of the Sabarmati Riverfront garden. 
Incidentally,the name missing from the invitation card for the grand event in the tribal district of Narmada is that of Cabinet minister for agriculture and water supply Babu Bokhiria,who has recently faced injunctions from the Gujarat High Court over encroachments.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi is expected to address a gathering of over 20,000 people at a school campus in Kevadia at 11 am,following which he will go to a spot on the bank of the Narmada river near Sadhu Tekri where he will perform the groundbreaking puja at an auspicious time of 12.39 pm. October 31 is the 138th birth anniversary of Indias first Home Minister Sardar Patel.
The other invitees to the event  Nitin Patel,Anandi Patel,Saurabh Patel,Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Ganpat Vasava  will also accompany him to the puja ceremony. Tribal MP Mansukh Vasava has been invited as a special guest.
Modi will also inaugurate the work to build the Garudeshwar Weir which will ensure water around the Sadhu Bet where the Sardar Patel statue is expected to come up. This will support boating and other tourism-related activity.
Police said tight security arrangements had been made for the event,but refused to divulge more details. After the Patna incident,we have taken all precautionary measures, Narmada SP Pravin Mall said. 
Statue of Unity now named Statue of Honour
GANDHINAGAR: The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET),formed to execute the Rs 2,500-crore Statue of Unity project under the chairmanship of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi,has decided to call the project Statue of Honour.  The declaration came on the SVPRETs revamped official website just a day before Modi was to share the dais with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who inaugurated the Sardar Patel museum in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. The homepage had a Google map image showing the exact location of the proposed statue with an added name tag that said Statue of Honour.

Modi handed out an exercise to the officers, who could not visit Kevadia this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, asking them to prepare a list of items of their personal use and check for foreign brand of products. Urging them to take it as a “personal challenge”, Modi asked the aspiring officers to check if they could substitute foreign brands with Made in India products to push the “Vocal for Local” campaign initiated by the government.
“…I have an assignment for you all. In the next few days, make a list of the things that you use every day and see how many items are Made in India or locally – right from your shoes to your phones and whatever personal use items you own. Make a list of those which are of foreign brands. Check how many of these foreign brands can you do without for your personal use or if you can substitute with local Indian products. You will find that a lot of products you use are made in other countries. You may have never known about their origin or thought about it before you purchased it,” Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The PM further urged the officers to look around the LBSNAA campus for products that are manufactured in other countries and suggest what could be replaced with Made in India products. “Also check your campus which is named after Lal Bahadur Shastri and is the place which generates officers like you, who will now make decisions for the nation. So, look around the campus and make a list of things that are not made in India. Check if it can be replaced with local items…”
Laying emphasis on the upcoming quarter of the century of India’s independence, Modi told the probationary officers that their decisions for their allotted jurisdictions should be in the larger interest of the nation and not for earning praise. He invoked the words of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said that Patel, who addressed the first ever batch of the civil services in India in April 1947, had referred to the bureaucracy as a “steel frame”.
Modi said, “Whatever be the frame, it cannot function without sound principles. So write down your own thoughts and goals in your diary and use it when you take up your responsibilities…”
Stating that he has directed elected representatives of the BJP to maintain a low profile in media, Modi said, “Media and social media will distract and lure you. But there is a difference in being in the media for good work and in doing work only to be in the media. You must follow role models who worked anonymously for the country with much discipline. There have been many bureaucrats before you who have left behind a legacy of good work but no one even knows about them…”
Modi urged the officers to promote local arts and culture of districts and areas that will be eventually allotted to them. He said, “Civil servants are identified by what they do differently from routines. Get out of your files and think differently. When you work in district blocks, you will find global potential in local arts and products. You have to support them with all your strength and vision to help them go global.”
Urging the trainees to resist the temptation of choosing the “easy road”, Modi said, “When you come out of this training, there will be two roads. Ek rasta aasan hoga, ek rasta kathin hoga. You will fall in trouble if you choose the easy road. Accidents happen on straight roads. On roads with bends and curves, drivers are alert. I will advise you to connect with people when you go for your field training. Don’t let the ‘babu’ get into your head. Remember the roots, earth and culture you come from. The society will be your strength. This is Jan Shakti.” Modi also urged the trainee officers to develop team spirit so as to ‘include successors’ and pass on incomplete projects to the next generation to carry forward. “You should not be identified by your name plate but by your works,” Modi said.
Adding that the government has “democratised the training for civil servants”, Modi said that the government had begun assigning the roles and responsibilities to bureaucrats based on their aptitudes to help them be “content and work better”."

Singh is to inaugurate the renovated Sardar Vallabhabhai Patel National Museum at Moti Mahal in Shahibaug October 29.
Sharing this detail,Patel said that when he went to  invite the PM,he told him that the person heading the state must also be invited to the function,and his (Gujarat CMs) name should be there on the invitation card.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Patel said the PM specifically called him up and instructed him to ensure that Modi was invited and his name printed on the invitation card.
He even called me up when I was in Nadiad to find out me if I had invited Modi and printed his name on the card, Patel said,adding This shows the greatness of the man(PM).
He said that when he went to meet the PM again,with the invitation card,and briefed him about the details of the programme,Singh once again asked him if Narendra Modi had been invited. It was only after I confirmed that it has been done did he agree to attend the function,  Patel told mediapersons.
The Union minister said he had spoken to Modi over the phone and he has confirmed that he would be coming to the function. He said that Modi would also be asked to speak at the function.
When asked if he expected some adverse political remarks from Modi at the function,he replied: I dont expect any adverse remarks from anybody. Those invited are good people and they will all speak good.
Asked if he had himself been invited to the foundation laying function of the Statue of Unity at Sardar Sarovar dam at Kevadia Colony on October 31,he said : I received the invitation at my residence at Nadiad yesterday. 
Many central ministers have also been invited,he added,but refused to confirm if he would be attending the Kevadia Colony event.
In response to a question on whether he has plans to join the BJP,a rumour that was triggered by his meeting Modi some months ago,Patel said, I am committed to the Congress and will always remain with the Congress. He added that he was a Central minister and so was free to meet Modi. I went to meet Modi in connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Memorial Society,of which I am chairman, he said,adding that all of the Rs 17 crore spent on the renovation of the Patel museum came from the Centre. 
According to him,some money for the memorial was given by the state government during the chief ministership of Chimanbhai Patel,during whose tenure he (Dinsha Patel) was the PWD Minister. Over Rs 1 crore was also given to the society by the government of Keshubhai Patel.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Trying to avoid giving a direct answer to a question on whether Modi was playing politics over the name of Sardar Patel,by mobilising the farmers across the country to be partners in making the statue of the Iron Man of India,he said,It is self-evident. And all of you know what he is doing. But I cant comment on it."

Architect Bimal Patel is the man behind most urban planning projects of note in the country, including redevelopment of the Central Vista in New Delhi now. In 2011, his firm HCP Design, Planning & Management designed the new office space, Swarnim Sankul, for Gujarat CM (then or Narendra Modi) and his Cabinet. More recently, the Padma Shri awardee has been associated with the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, expected to be ready by 2021, and the Mumbai Port Trust development, aimed at revamping the eastern seafront of the city. He started his architectural career in the mid-’80s and made his mark with revamp of the Kankaria Lake Waterfront (2006) and the Sabarmati Riverfront (2002)
NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN: The Central Vista is part of our national architectural history and iconography. Does it really need to change? In the way that you are planning it — tearing down some buildings, replacing it with other buildings — will we lose some of our history with such a change?
As we go around making this major change, we will try to do it in a way that it is not a rupture with the past. What we are trying to do is to respect history, perhaps even strengthen the original intent by using architecture to strengthen the original diagram… There’s nothing we are doing that doesn’t say, listen, this is exactly what (Sir Edwin) Lutyens would have done. It might be a radical change but certainly not something that breaks with the past — it’s taking the past and working with it.

On whether facilities need to be modernised or not, my personal views are not that important… One big motivation for Parliament’s modernisation is the expansion needs. Milan Vaishnav did a nice article on the crisis of representation, on how the number of people MPs are representing is rising with rising population. Second, there are imbalances country-wide due to population changes. All these issues will have to be tackled, which will need expansion. If you need expansion, you are going to have to make a new facility. That’s what our conclusion was.

To move people from the ministry, from North and South Blocks… gladdens my heart as an individual,” says Dr Bimal Patel. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)
Anybody who’s trying to make administration work more efficiently will see the need for having appropriate infrastructure. Personally, if you ask me, I’m not surprised by the government’s or the Prime Minister’s decision to do it. The way he used to work in Gandhinagar, where you have the Central Secretariat with everybody sitting… the kind of synergies that you get from everybody being in one place, from having a standardised infrastructure… anybody who has run large organisations knows that you need the infrastructure. I see it very much as a part of modernising administration. This is not to build new buildings; the buildings are the means of modernising administration and making it more efficient. The government’s objective is to synergise functioning. That is driving the whole idea.
As for the Central Vista, the avenue would have been refurbished… in any case… and there’s no radical change here. To move people from the ministry, from North and South Blocks… gladdens my heart as an individual. When I go there, I can gape at the buildings, at the mysterious things that go on inside… Essentially, even when Lutyens and (Herbert) Baker built them, these were meant to be architectural instruments of intimidation. They were going to be on a high hill and government was going to be up there… It’s about time, I would say, that we truly appropriated these buildings. These are just personal views.
Sometimes, hesitation paralyses us. I operate in the public realm in different places, and I see that paralysis everywhere because people are so worried about unthoughtful development that they want to see no change at all. I think we have to be cheerful about how we make the change. Change is inevitable because things change, technology changes, population changes, and life changes.
RAVISH TIWARI: But why are we trying to create something, that took two decades to build, in five-seven years. Why the rush?
The first building I did in my life was the Gujarat High Court, measuring 1 lakh sq ft. This (the Central Vista) is 100 lakh sq ft. It took seven years to build at the time. That was India then with 2% growth, flyovers and infrastructure took forever to be built… If it can be done faster, then why not do it? It saves money, time of disruption etc. Everywhere we go, all of us Indians say why do we take so long to build our infrastructure? I have read many articles which talk about why our infrastructure takes so long to be built. So could it be done faster? Can we do it in three shifts? Many people come back with stories on how in China, they build one floor a day… Maybe you could see this is as a symbol, a desire to do things fast?… I have worked with many industrialists who have wanted their factories to be up and running by a certain day… If you are going to do it at the expense of quality, then I would say hold on… I think there’s a very clear message to us saying minimise the disruption in whatever way you can; not just in terms of construction or moving offices… I would rather see it this way.
SOMYA LAKHANI: How will you ensure that Lutyens’s symmetry — with no building interrupting another building’s view — is maintained?
You cannot come to Central Vista, design something and not be respectful of the symmetry that exists. I believe that if someone looks at it, they will not complain about at least that dimension. I’m being very careful in wanting to continuously reinforce the essential diagram of Lutyens, rather than work against it… When you are doing additions, you have to be respectful. You don’t have to mimic it completely — there are new requirements, new technology… You find me one building where I have not been respectful.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: What kind of expenses will be involved?
The numbers are being worked on. I still have no idea of the facilities the PMO etc will have. Parliament is a very special building, but the office buildings are at office building costs. I can’t give you a full number because it doesn’t exist. These figures will be available in a couple of months. The office buildings will be a picture of rationality and efficiency. As Parliament has a more significant function, we might do a little more there. (But) the office buildings are the big chunk of it. Refurbishment costs, pavings, I doubt it will be anything more than what paving work costs in Delhi at the moment… Maybe we will spend on better light fittings, signages. Every time you make an expense, the real question is what are you making it for. Is it to increase the life or functionality of the structure, to improve its look and feel? I’m from Ahmedabad where clients are very demanding. So that becomes part of the DNA of any Ahmedabad architect, I’m not special in that regard… I think we are careful about costs here also.
KRISHN KAUSHIK: While you say that if things can move faster, let them, the 2024 deadline seems to be politically motivated — it’s the election year.
You are asking the wrong person. I have no way of answering that question. I am a professional and we get these sort of demands — sometimes they are doable, sometimes they are not. If it is doable, I will help them do it. If it isn’t doable, I will respectfully say it can’t be done. I can’t blame that person for wanting it.
NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN: Your client is the government of India. Who are you actually building for? Are you making this in the image of the individual or individuals who occupy the offices of the Government of India right now, or are you building it for all time, for all the people?
I don’t think there is a question in this. Public projects of this sort are successful if they meet the needs of various people. It’s not one person, and they’re fun because there are multiple people and dimensions to their needs. Is it for the tourists who come? Sure, I want tourists to come. Is it for civic users who want to go to the garden on Sunday with their families? Yes, it’s for them too. Is it for the national spectacle that we have, the (Republic Day) parade? Yes, it is for that too. Is it for the office-goers who work there? It is for them too. Is it for the Speaker, the President? Yes, it is for everybody. To say it is for this person or that is out of the question when you’re doing public projects. Also, in public projects these days, the real challenge is to find that common ground as there are such opposing views about things. I am hoping our common sense will make this project work.

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN: Has the Prime Minister seen this presentation? Did he have any particular inputs or demands?
Yes, certainly, and he had demands. One of them was how fast can we finish the project. That was certainly a demand that came from him. I wasn’t surprised as I have worked with him in the past and this is how he operates. He said let’s do this, but let us make sure it’s not an endless immune project. I had a drawing of three halls, joint session hall. He looked at it and said, ‘Do we really need this hall, it’s used only twice a year. Can’t you figure out a way to double the Lok Sabha hall for this?’ That was a specific request… I’m a professional, people make requests to me. I tell them what is and isn’t possible. Sometimes I say this is simply not possible.

KRISHN KAUSHIK: After the public tendering process starts, how will you ensure that both quality and deadlines are met because that is not in your hands at all times?
Yes, it’s certainly not in my hands — project management issues become important at some stage. I can do things now that will help the project go further. We are discussing the designs with contractors, not with the ones who will bid for this, but the ones I’m familiar and have worked with. We do this for many projects. I tell them this is what I’m designing and ask if they see any problems. They may tell me not to use stone, it could create problems as it takes too much time to polish a stone floor… So lots of inputs can be taken at this stage… Otherwise, the problem with the traditional tendering process is that the architect sits in a black box, produces the design and shows it to a contractor, who looks at it and says some things are going to be very costly and some things are going to take a lot of time. Then you are forced to revise the design. So we are trying to crunch all of that.
AMRITH LAL: Was there any discussion about having a smaller place for the President?
No. I think everybody is proud of the fact that that is the President’s House, and that gives meaning to the place… I am quite proud of the fact that something that was constructed at the time has been so fully taken over by us, made part of our bloodstream — it is really heartening to see. I do run into a few stray people who call it a colonial symbol or a vestige but, by and large, everybody looks at it proudly. Therefore, the reasons to keep it the way it is, to strengthen and cherish it, that’s really the objective.
DEVYANI ONIAL: In the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, there has been criticism over the demolition of lanes and homes that are characteristic of Banaras. What were the challenges?
People have a lot of views about Banaras and very little information. Once I do that presentation maybe people will think it’s not as problematic as they thought it was, because they will see the logic behind it… This temple gets a hundred thousand people… you must have visited the place, it’s a security and safety risk. There’s a 1916 speech by Gandhiji at Banaras Hindu University, in which he says, ‘I went to Kashi Vishwanath temple last evening, and I speak as a Hindu. Can’t our temples be more spacious? Can’t they be clean? Why do they have to be like this?’ That’s what Gandhiji had to say. And in some ways these improvements around temples… it’s about saying, listen, there are common pilgrims getting fleeced… The (new) project is a big improvement. They are building toilets, a shaded area in which 3,000 pilgrims can line up, there is a place where they can put their chappals and not get fleeced, it’s a place that can be kept clean and you don’t have to look at the ground while walking. Why do we have open running gutters as part of romantic India? I will show you places where these galis you are talking about are actually encroachment, built on top of heritage structures, on top of temples.

AAKASH JOSHI: Why did you not go in for broader political consultation on the Central Vista project and made your job easy?
I have worked on public projects for the last 25 years. It’s important to have consultation, indeed, and it is at various levels. It is a process. In such a complex process where do you start from and where do you end… My experience with all these projects is that, sadly, one never gets it right, and that is for two reasons. As a society we don’t have that much expertise, and nobody seems to be ready for a mature discussion. As we do more and more projects, I think we will get better. But I agree, we could do the consultation project much better.
SOMYA LAKHANI: One of the concerns about the project is the pollution that its construction would cause. Do you have a plan regarding that?
This vision of one project suddenly engulfing Delhi in a fog of pollution is to be examined. It already has a fog of pollution and it doesn’t come from here… The maximum amount of dust in the air is because of unpaved streets… The vehicles are plying and throwing up dust… Streets constitute at least 20% of the land area of the city. Once we examine the issues, these fears turn out to be false. Everybody is looking at a city growing and is worried about a concrete jungle covering entire India. That is a scare. If all Indians were to be urbanised and they were to consume land, how much of India would be covered by cities? One billion Indians in city, all concrete-paved. How much of India would be concrete?… This fear that you will be engulfed in pollution with one more construction site is a little bit exaggerated.
Read | What does a nation’s architecture say about its aspirations, politics and drawbacks?
Nonetheless, we will constantly humidify the site. Most construction sites are wet. Humidifying sites during demolition is easily possible and can be built into the contract. One idea is to house construction workers at the end of the metro line so that they take the metro and come to work like others. The contractor doesn’t have to be given separate land for housing construction workers. Perhaps you need to stagger timings, so that construction workers come like that. We could have noise barriers, like noise protectors. Another thing you could do is crunch construction time before elections.
KRISHN KAUSHIK: How is it that almost all the pet projects of the Prime Minister are bagged by one architect?
Do you think these are the only projects that he is doing? I am not doing the Prime Ministers’ museum. I did not do Statue of Unity. Perhaps, I am a good architect.
It was an open competition. I speak at the risk of being self-interested in this… A project of this scale, size and complexity requires capacity. You look for somebody who has in the past done something equivalent."

Stressing on the reach of the social media,Modi set a target for the BJP workers of getting 50,000 followers per Lok Sabha seat into the social media. Calling 2014 a challenge,Modi said he was not interested in the 26 polling booth target,but in winning 90 per cent of the booths.
Truth is screaming from the rooftops,the people have instilled immense faith in BJP and are looking at the extraordinary atmosphere in our favour,our responsibility has only increased,said Modi at the first of the four Vijay Vishwas Sneh Milan (Get together for Victory) on Saturday,targeted at six Lok Sabha seats.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He sought dedicated workers who would motivate others for the next 200 days on every booth. Modi said,Lets have one Vijay Vrati (worker pledged to victory) for each booth. For the next 200 days from today,this Vijay Vrati will work round the clock to spread the message.
Earlier,he had addressed workers in Bihar through teleconferencing. On a number of occasions,he had held video talks with Non Resident Indians in the US. But in his 12-year-old tenure,this was the first time that Modi hosted a virtual Sneh Milan  for zone-wise party workers. 
By Tuesday,Modi will cover all of the 26 Lok Sabha constituencies. For the six Lok Sabha seats covered on Saturday,hundreds of senior workers had gathered in one centre,where arrangements for listening to Modi on an LED screen were made at scheduled venues. 
At Valsad,they had gathered at Pratapnagar Park in Dharampur,Bardoli workers at Tradkuva in Vyara,Chhota Udepur workers at Shirohiwala High School in Badoli,Dahod workers at Dahod city ground,Panchmahal workers at New Era school in Godhra and  Bharuch workers at Hostel Ground in Bharuch. 
I had never imagined that people from every corner of the country will have bank on the BJP to save them from trouble times. Response in Bahraich,where I was yesterday,was overwhelming. There is illiteracy and poverty. But they rest their hope on the BJP. When India has so much hope on us,Gujarat will have to set an example. The next election is a challenge. Not just the 26 constituencies,our target should be to win 90 per cent of the booths. Gujarat has over 40,000 booths.
In the 2004 LS polls,BJP had won only 14 seats and in the following election in 2009,its tally was increased only by one seat,irrespective a remarkable performance in assembly elections.

The stage is set for a grand birthday celebration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday at Kevadia Colony, where he is scheduled to participate in Namami Narmade Mahotsava, an event organised by the state government to mark the occasion of the Sardar Sarovar Dam crossing its Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 138.68 metres.
On Monday, dog squads and security agencies continued to sanitise the “A” frame of the dam where Modi will offer obeisance to Goddess Narmada under the guidance of Viranchiprasad Shastri, a priest from Nareshwar who had also presided over the 2017 event of the inaugural puja.
According to officials, as many as 100 priests will chant prayers along the riverbank of Narmada, while Modi will offer a coconut and chunri to the river.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A platform has been erected at the ‘View Point-3’ of the dam under a waterproof dome from where Modi will address a gathering.
Narmada District Collector I K Patel said while tourists are advised to arrive after noon, there will be no restrictions in place for visitors to the dam and the Statue of Unity.
According to the data of the Narmada Control Authority, the water level in the dam has reduced to 138.61 metres Monday, after the much-celebrated feat of the reservoir touching 138.68 metres or its FRL. The current live storage in the reservoir is 5,737 MCM with the inflow of water from MP reducing to about 4 lakh cusec.
The Sardar Sarovar Dam is also releasing a commensurate amount of water downstream through its gates as well as the Riverbed Powerhouse (RBPH) which has been operational since August 11.
The RBPH, as well as the Canal Head Power House (CHPH) have generated a total of 4,11,186 MW of electricity in September so far, and a total of 10,18,000 MW since mid August this year.
Following Modi’s landslide victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Narmada Control Authority granted permission to raise the height of Sardar Sarovar Dam from 121.92 metre to 138.68 metre. With a length of 1.2 kilometre and depth of 163 metre, the project is supposed to be the third largest dams in India.
The maximum water level of the dam is 140.21 metres, which means that the authorities will be able to fill up the reservoir to 140.21 metres beyond 138.68 metres.
According to the dam records, the submergence of lands at FRL amounts to 37,690 ha (hectares), which comprises 11,279 ha agricultural land, 13,542 ha forests and 12,869 ha river bed and waste land. In all 245 villages in three states — 193 in Madhya Pradesh, 33 in Maharashtra and 19 in Gujarat — are affected.
The project website states, “Only three villages in Gujarat are fully affected, while the remaining 242 villages are partly affected. In Madhya Pradesh, out of 193 villages, more than 10% agricultural land will be submerged in 79 villages. In 89 villages, less than 10% agricultural land or only houses will be submerged under FRL. In the remaining 25 villages, only government waste land will be submerged.”"

Patel, a freedom fighter who became India’s first home minister and deputy prime minister, is credited with unifying hundreds of princely states with the Union of India following independence through a mix of persuasion, dialogue and even use of force when required.

Inaugurating the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said no other project in the world had faced so many “hurdles”. He said many people had “conspired to stop” the project and launched a “massive misinformation campaign”, and the World Bank had refused to fund it.
Returning to Gujarat on his 67th birthday, two days after he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in his home state, Modi also reached out to farmers and the Patidar community ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections due later this year. He inaugurated a new yard of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and milk processing and cattle-feed plants of the Amreli District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited (ADCMPUL) in Amreli, where the BJP is facing a challenge from the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) led by Hardik Patel.
Flanked by two Patidars — former Gujarat minister Dilip Sanghani and Surat-based diamond merchant Savji Dholakia — Modi urged farmers to launch a “sweet revolution” and “blue revolution” by taking up beekeeping and optimising use of waterways for transportation respectively.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Earlier in the day, Modi addressed a rally about 55 kilometres from the Sardar Sarovar Dam site in Dabhoi town of Vadodara district. “No other project in the world has faced such hurdles as the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river. But we were determined to complete the project,” he said.
“Many false allegations were hurled on us. Many people conspired to stop this project. But we were determined not to make it a political battle,” he said. “There is a list (‘kachcha chittha’) of people who conspired against the project and wanted it stalled… I will not name them as I do not want to go down that road,” he said.

“A massive misinformation campaign was launched against the project. The World Bank, which had earlier agreed to fund the project, refused to give loan for it, raising environmental concerns… I decided that with or without the World Bank, we would go ahead with the project,” Modi said. “In the obstructions created by forces against the project, Ma Narmada has suffered the most,” he added.
“When the World Bank refused to give funds, the temples of Gujarat donated money… This project, therefore, is not of any particular party or government. It is the project of each and every person,” he said.
The “same World Bank was compelled to give the state a Green Award” following the Gujarat government’s rehabilitation work after the 2001 earthquake in Kutch, said Modi.

He said that the dam, conceptualised nearly six decades ago, would become a symbol of the country’s growing prowess and boost growth in the region. “Sardar Sarovar will become a symbol of India’s new and emerging power and propel growth in the region…the project is an engineering miracle,” he said.
Paying tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and B R Ambedkar, he said: “It is the country’s misfortune that we could not be blessed by the presence of Sardar Saab and Babasaheb for a few more years. Had they lived longer, India would have achieved new heights in development. If Sardar Saab had lived longer, the Narmada dam would have been ready in the 1970s… Today, after the inauguration of the Narmada dam, the soul of Sardar Patel must be jubilant, blessing us all. He had envisioned the dam 75 years ago, even before independence. Imagine the great vision of the man who could dream so big for the sake of farmers.”
Thanking the tribal families who were displaced by the project, Modi said, “India will remember and honour their sacrifice for development of the country.”
“Nothing is a bigger impediment to development than water,” said Modi. “When the water of Narmada Dam reached Rajasthan, Vasundharaji (Raje), Jaswant Singhji and other leaders told me that the significance of this water coming from Gujarat was great. In history, wars have been fought and swords have been drawn over water-sharing issues.”
“As Gujarat Chief Minister, I visited a BSF post and saw they had no drinking water. I resolved that I would bring Narmada’s water to my country’s jawan at the Pakistan border in Gujarat, 700 kilometres away… Today, I can see the smile and satisfaction on the faces of the jawans,” he said.
“I will leave no stone unturned to achieve a New India, like Mahatma Gandhi achieved a New India earlier. I am living for your dreams, I will also exhaust myself for your dreams, for New India,” he said. “You know me, I can’t do small things. I don’t think small, don’t do small things. With 1.25 billion people with me, I can’t dream small,” he said.
The Sardar Sarovar dam is intended to provide drinking water to 131 urban centres and 9,633 villages (53 per cent of total 18,144 villages of Gujarat) and irrigation facilities for 18.54 hectares of land covering 3,112 villages under 73 talukas in 15 districts.
Besides Gujarat, the Narmada canal will also irrigate 2,46,000 hectares of land in the desert districts of Barmer and Jalore of Rajasthan.
Among those present at the event today were Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Gujarat Governor O P Kohli, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel and former Chief Minister Anandiben Patel."

Meanwhile,the district administration and the SSNNL are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the grand ceremony passes off without any eventuality,particularly since the tribal villagers around the hillock made vocal their opposition to the plan to set up the statue.
The government in mid-June deployed three jawans of the specially created Narmada Battalion,a special task force carved out of the State Reserve Police Force (SRP),to secure the dam site,following a rally taken out recently by the local tribals against land acquisition by the Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) for tourism infrastructure around the statue. The neighbouring villages laid claim on the Tekri,which according to the tribals is of religious importance. Villagers maintained that the hillock,located 3.2 km from the Narmada dam,is originally called Varata Bawa Tekri,named after a local deity,and hence is a site of religious importance. Now the district administration fears that villagers may walk up to the hillock and place a religious flag on it.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Chief Minister Narendra Modi plans to take out a rally on Sadhu Island,located 3.5 km from the construction site,to mobilise farmers to donate iron pieces for building the statue,which will be placed right in front of Sadhu Bet,facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river at Kevadia in Narmada district. The crowd is likely to be restricted up to 20,000 to 30,000,given the relatively small size of the island,sources said.
The SSNNL,on behalf of Sardar Patel Rashtriya Ekta Manch,will begin construction of a exhibition hall,a bridge connecting the statue site with mainland at Kevadia,a memorial garden,administrative complex plus hotel and a visitors gallery simultaneously in December. The state government has already started the process of awarding the construction work of Rs 2,063 crore to build the Sardar Patel statue,a 182-feet structure set to be the tallest in the world. The technical bids are scheduled to be held on December 6.
The iron collection drive is being seen as a rural mobilisation campaign of the BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections. The construction of the statue is likely to begin in December and is expected to be completed within 42 months.
On Wednesday,the cabinet meeting was followed by a meeting of the core committee,which was attended by Finance Minister Nitin Patel,Revenue Minister Anandi Patel and Energy and Petrochemical Minister Saurabh Patel.

In a notification, dated November 7, the Garudeshwar mamlatdar included the entire Gora village, located near the Statue of Unity and the Shoolpaneshwar sanctuary, under eco-sensitive zone and added the state government as a “co-holder” on the land survey numbers. Close to 120 land owners in Gora have, so far, filed their objection before the mamlatdar on November 10.
The letter issued by the mamlatdar said: “As per the letter of the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), Narmada, dated January 28, 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has published a final notification declaring eco-sensitive zone around Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Narmada on May 5, 2016. Accordingly, as per the provisions of the said notification of the Central government, several activities will now stand prohibited in the eco-sensitive zone. The land in the eco-sensitive zone — including that of the forest department, horticulture department, for agricultural use, plots reserved for parks — will not be allowed to be transferred for non-agricultural use for commercial, industrial or residential purposes. Any land that need to be transferred for non-agricultural use will be allowed to do so only after a mandatory approval for such a transfer is sought from the state government, based on an application of the Monitoring Committee.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The notification further states the area in the periphery of the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary has been included under the eco-sensitive zone and the entire Gora village has been included in this list. “Since the area is now under the notification of eco-sensitive zone, the process has been initiated to include the state government as the second owner of the land in the villages as per their revenue survey numbers. The inclusion of this entry of the government in the Record of Rights, prescribed under Village Form VII of the Land Revenue Records, has been made as per the above-mentioned notification of the central government,” it stated.
The Village Form VII of the land revenue records includes detailed information about the owner of land and rights and liabilities of the landholder. It also includes details of the cultivable area of the agricultural land as well as the boundary of survey marks, and the survey number of the land. It reflects the changes in ownership of the land, including those passed down through generations as well as the mutation numbers. Also called the ‘7/12 Utara’, the document has to be produced at the sub-registrar’s office when a sale transaction of land is done.
Villagers say the notification was pasted on the office of the Gora panchayat on November 7 evening, a Saturday, thus not allowing the owners to raise immediate objection the next day. “We have handed over our objection letter (vanda arji) to the addition of the state government as a co-owner of our lands. We are close to 120 landowners and this step has been taken without our consent,” Gora village sarpanch Shanti Tadvi said.
According to Tadvi, although the move of the mamlatdar came as a “surprise, without prior warning”, the village had seen surveys been conducted by various government departments. Tadvi said, “The plan is to include close to 121 villages around this sanctuary as part of the eco-sensitive zone. They have begun with Gora. We are not sure what the intention is, but given the history of the land acquisitions for tourism in the area, we are sceptical.”
In their objection letters, the villagers have cited “complete hold” on their lands, as guaranteed by the Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 or PESA — a law enacted by the Government of India for ensuring self-governance through traditional gram sabhas for people living in the Scheduled Areas of India.
“We will now have to seek permission from the government to be able to do anything on the lands we own. They say that they want to protect it from us, but we are the original owners. Who else can protect us better than we?” Tadvi asked.
Rumours of imminent tourism projects in the area have left most villagers on the edge about the possibility of an ouster from their lands. While the district administration officers deny any knowledge of projects planned, forest officials said the reason was to only “protect the sanctuary”.
A forest department officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “Many of the villages have been protected under The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), which recognises the three rights of forest-dwelling tribals: their individual rights to occupation and cultivation; community rights for grazing, collection of firewood; and selling of permitted forest produce. The only issue here is that they do tend to encroach on forest land. We have had such issues at Dediapada taluka area of the district where encroachments have become an issue. Having a law in place will help us safeguard the ecology.” The officer denied that any tourism project has been planned in the area.
Shooplaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary has many species of animals namely sloth bear, leopard, rhesus macaque, chousingha, barking deer, pangolin, chital, Indian civet, palm civet, wild dogs, leopards, Indian porcupine among others, the official added. The total protected area is 60770.78 hectares. Of this, 3184.13 hectare was diverted for Sardar Sarovar Project dam in 1987.
In 2017, the executive engineer, Roads & Building (Panchayat) Rajpipla proposed a change of surface of Zarwani-Mathasar road on 1.88 hectare of land in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, citing that it would ensure road access to remote villages inhabited by poor tribals. The proposal stated that is was necessary to have, “black topping (tarring) of WBM (kachcha) road to convert it into concrete (pakka) road. The sanctuary has 105 villages inhabited predominantly by tribes who are poor and deprived of basic civic amenities. The remote villages are connected by WBM kachcha road and during monsoon the vehicular movement becomes very difficult and often people suffer due to lack of connectivity, especially during medical emergencies and commuting of school children”.
The proposal was approved by the Chief Wildlife Warden with conditions that the wildlife should not be disturbed and the material required for the work would be prepared outside the sanctuary. Later, as the Statue of Unity was completed in 2018, the state government created a simultaneous tourist spot in Zarwani — 28 kilometres from the district head Rajpipla and eight kilometres from Gora village — calling it the Zarwani Eco Campsite. The site is functional for tourists visiting Kevadia colony, which has now been christened as Kevadia Tourism Circuit after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a total of 17 new projects around the SoU on October 31.
The website of the Zarwani Eco Campsite describes it as a “day picnics or trek with the help of the forest department, with the forest, waterfalls and other natural beauty within easy reach”. Other sightseeing areas nearby include the Zarwani waterfalls, the Shoolpaneshwar Temple, the Gheer Khadi. The facilities inside the sanctuary for the campsite includes cottages with attached bath and toilet facilities, tented accommodations, dormitory for 10 people at one time, kitchen and dining place as well as a campfire area but prohibits smoking, pets and flashlight photography.
Tadvi says, “We are not sure if this is the first step in turning this pristine forest into something else. They have not taken us into confidence. We know that the development of Kevadia for tourism happened against the will of the locals with the government departments arm twisting their way. The Ekta Nursery (one of the ancillary tourist sites around SoU) and other government lands in our village also belonged to our forefathers and were acquired by processes that illiterate villagers of those days could not understand. We are planning to move courts citing PESA Act, but we are poor tribals who feel we will be defeated.”
It is in Gora village that the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) has decided to construct the ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ relocation settlement for the beneficiaries from six villages — Limbdi, Kevadia, Vagadiya, Navagam, Kothi and Gora, who had been protesting the acquisition of their lands in 1961 for the Narmada Dam — over 16 hectares of its land. The SSNNL has also invited tenders for a ropeway to connect the two banks of the Narmada River, across the 1.2 km length of Narmada dam so that tourists visiting Kevadia can reach the allied projects on the other side across the river within a matter of minutes. The drive around the river through the Gora bridge is about 30 minutes long.
Resident Additional Collector, Rajpipla, HK Vyas told The Sunday Express, “The entire process is executed on behalf of the forest department, which has sent the application. The district administration has no role or part in the ownership of the land or the addition of title for ownership,” Vyas said."

While many of the Modi followers were amazed that even on his birthday the Prime Minister is looking forward in serving the nation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday unveiled the world’s tallest statue — Statue of Unity — as a tribute to freedom fighter and India’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The 182-metre statue of Patel is an “answer to those who question India’s existence”, PM Modi said at the inaugural ceremony in Gujarat’s Kevadiya district. “It shows that India was, is and always will be eternal,” he said.
Air Force planes showered flowers on the statue as the prime minister dedicated it to the nation, on the birth anniversary of Iron man of India – Sardar Patel. The statue, twice the size of the Statue of Liberty, is built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore. Apart from the statue itself, there are five other related sites that are constructed along with the world’s tallest statue. These include the walkway, the ticket counter, the food court, the four-lane approach highway, and the ‘Shrestha Bharat Bhavan’- a 52-room three-star lodging facility for the visitors coming to see the monument.

Crediting Sardar Patel for a “united India,” Modi said, “Had Sardar Patel not united the country, we would need visas to see lions or pay homage at Somnath or view the Charminar in Hyderabad. Patel converted India’s diversity into its biggest strength. The country is today following the path shown by Patel and is moving towards becoming the world’s greatest economic and strategic power.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also said that the statue will promote the livelihood of the people in the area. “This is the tallest statue in the world. People across the world will visit this site and remember it. The contribution of the tribals, farmers and villagers, who helped to make the Statue of Unity cannot be ignored. The statue will bring prosperity to the tribals, farmers and villagers in this region. It will lead to job creation and promote tourism in the area,” Modi said.
“The world’s tallest statue would remind the entire world, the future generations about the courage, capabilities and resolution of the person who did this holy work of thwarting the conspiracy to disintegrate Mother India into pieces,” the prime minister said addressing a gathering after inaugurating the monument. This (statue) is a source of unity…with this sentiment we should march…and march with a dream to make the country ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ (One India, Superior India),” he added.
“Like Sardar Patel united the country geographically by merging erstwhile princely states, we have united the country economically by bringing in GST,” the PM said. “We are expanding Sardar Patel’s resolve of uniting the country by introducing various schemes, such as One Nation One Grid, eNAM and Bharatmala. Through such schemes of connecting the country, we are committed to make Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat(One India Best India)” he said.

The statue was conceptualised by Modi when he was Gujarat Chief Minister. The foundation stone was laid in October 2013. “It is my honour that I got a chance to pay the tribute to the great man. It is Patel’s efforts that have led our country to what it is today. Today is a day that will be remembered in the history of India. No Indian will ever forget this day.”
Also present at the venue were Gujarat Governor O P Kohli, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel, BJP chief Amit Shah, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala and Madhya Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel.

The statue stands on Sadhu island on the Narmada, 3.2 km downstream of Sardar Sarovar Dam. The statue is designed by Padma Bhushan-winning sculptor Ram V Sutar and has been built by Larsen and Toubro and the state-run Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. It shows Patel wearing a traditional dhoti and shawl, towering over the Narmada River. The height was picked as ‘182’ metre to match the total Assembly constituencies in Gujarat.

The Statue of Unity has, however, drawn flak from tribals and farmers living in the region who called it a “mass destruction” of natural resources. They had also called for a boycott of the event. Launching an attack on those opposing the Statue of Unity, PM Modi said he is “amazed” that protesters are giving it a “political colour.” “The statue is a symbol of country’s respect to this great man. Praising great icons like Patel has also brought us criticism. It seems like we have committed a big crime,” he said.

The government also organised a ‘Run for Unity’ to mark Patel’s anniversary. Flagging off the run in New Delhi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh called Patel “symbol of India’s unity.” “He had brought the country’s 562 principalities under the fold of the union and had achieved this task within a very short span of 70 days through a bloodless revolution,” Singh said.
Read | PM Modi writes: Sardar Patel worked with astonishing speed to dismantle the legacy of imperialism and create the geography of unity with the spirit of nationalism.
Singh said it was Patel who had ensured that the country remains united with its uniqueness of diversity in religion, language and culture. “Patel had dreamt of an India which is always strong and united. Our prime minister is working in that direction by taking everyone along,” Singh said.
Union ministers Harsh Vardhan, R K Singh, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Hardeep Puri, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba, boxer and Rajya Sabha member MC Mary Kom, gymnast Dipa Karmakar, hockey legend Zafar Iqbal and weightlifter Karnam Malleswari participated the event held at Major Dhyan Chand national stadium in the national capital."

There are many similarities between Harsh Srivastav and Sarfaraz Ali. They both graduated from Uttar Pradesh’s Awadh University, they have both been working in the telecom sector for four years, and they are both colleagues at the newly opened Xiaomi store in Ayodhya’s Hanuman Garhi area, barely a kilometre from the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site.
They know it better as ‘RJB’.


	ExplainedThe final countdown

As countdown begins in the case that will finally decide the fate of the disputed site, and days ahead of arguments drawing to a close in the Supreme Court on October 17, many roads are making their way to Ayodhya. But here in the temple town, in the midst of the festive season, more buzz is around a newly opened store and a mall.

Srivastav, 24, and Ali, 21, part of Ayodhya’s post-Babri Masjid demolition generation, explain why. Thankful for the air-conditioner in their store — whose neon orange board and glitzy walls stand out among the old ‘Shri Ram’ shops selling conch shells, kalash, incense stick holders, coconuts, and jerry cans to hold river Sarayu’s water — Srivastav says, “The youth in Ayodhya are like youth in any part of the country, glued to phones and in search of better opportunities.”
Like others in Ayodhya, both believe that for this, they need to make their way out of the town.
Nearby preparations are on for a grand Diwali, with the Yogi Adityanath government promising a bigger event than the previous two times. Last year, South Korea’s First Lady Kim Jung-Sook was the chief guest, and the Chief Minister had renamed Faizabad district under which the holy town falls as Ayodhya district.
Those who suffered in the aftermath of the Babri demolition on both sides in Ayodhya are preparing too, for the verdict to give them “justice”, hoping it will help them put behind the violence of those days.
The hope shared by all is for the town to “move on”. Saying that religion is important, but “in our daily life, none of this matters”, Srivastav says that while he would be very happy if the verdict was in favour of a temple, “whatever it is, the issue should end with the Supreme Court judgment. We will all accept it. Ayodhya must look beyond Hindu-Muslim, mandir-masjid. That’s all we have heard since we were born.”

Adds Ali, scrolling through songs on his phone, “As a Muslim, I want a mosque at the RJB site. But if a temple is made, there will be more tourism in Ayodhya, and in turn more jobs. So, I am fine with a temple too.”

With Ayodhya centric to the BJP’s political agenda, the Adityanath government has unveiled a series of projects for the town with a population of close to 60,000. These include plans to make Ayodhya a ‘Smart City’, Rs 174 crore for a medical college (to add to Ayodhya’s three government colleges), Rs 400 crore for an airport, a 221-metre Lord Ram Statue, to be highest in the world and taller than the Statue of Unity in Gujarat (its budget has not yet been revealed), and a Rs 31-crore revamp of the area along Sarayu. The medical college is almost complete.
Says Ayodhya District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha, “We are still deciding on a place for the Ram statue. As for the airport, two villages have agreed to give up their land. We are negotiating with two others as well.”
Adds Jitendra Kane, the Chief Engineer at the Ayodhya Nagar Nigam, “When work begins on the Smart City project, there will be smart cards for buses, wi-fi, e-Challan system for traffic etc.”

It doesn’t take much to shatter their illusions, laughs Shivam Yadav, 18, a B.Sc first-year student at the government K S Saket P G College. With college on autumn break, a few students have come to collect scholarship forms and deposit submissions. “FB dekh kar hamein hamari aukaat pata chal jaati hai (Facebook shows us our place in the country),” says the eldest of three children of a teacher. “My friend who is pursuing B.Tech in Greater Noida says it is so much better… We have nothing, no malls, hotels, non-vegetarian food… Sirf vivaad (only conflict)… Politicians have sown seeds of distrust.”
Paint is chipping off the walls of the college building while its basketball court is filled with water from the previous day’s rain. Pointing to the infrastructure, Rajat Srivastav, 17, a first-year student, says he hopes to clear the NEET medical entrance, “move out from here”. “Hindu or Muslim, the new generation wants education,” he asserts.
Abdul Razaq, 18, who is also preparing for NEET, accuses politicians of using religion to divert attention from these “real issues”. “If one raises questions about education and development, all they say is ‘Mandir yahin banayenge (The temple will be built here)’.”

Amrita Verma, 22, a first-year D Pharma student, says women figure even lower among the government’s priorities. Rushing for a special class, Verma, the daughter of a lawyer, fears the verdict wouldn’t be the end of the discord. Asking the government to pay some of that attention to women’s security, she says, “We hear of schemes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, but on the ground, women don’t feel safe. We all want to take up jobs after college… But how does our opinion matter? Women are not a part of the conversation anyway.”
Her friend Kanti Yadav, 17, adds that most women she knows are not even allowed phones. As others laugh, she suggests, “The court should order that a college be made at the RJB site, which will have both Hindu and Muslim students.”
Three kilometres away, around 4 pm, to the sound of the evening aarti from Hanuman Garhi, a crowd builds up around coaching centres near the market, offering classes for a range of competitive exams, from entry to the IAS and Army to teacher training. Photographs of those who topped the exams last year dot the town.
Ajay Chaudhary, 25, teaches ‘General Studies’ at Sankalp Academy, which has over 100 students taking classes in turns in a cramped room. “If you just walk into galis off the main road, like this one, you will see that dharm (religion) doesn’t really matter. You will also see the problems of Ayodhya — the open drains, crumbling homes, broken pathways.”
He admits that all students and teachers at the centre, born after 1992, want a Ram Mandir, but adds that there is little enthusiasm about it. “How will it help us? All the students here are working hard to land jobs outside.”
Shivam Yadav has a more immediate concern. “We have heard a large number of troops will be coming in before the judgment and will stay at our college. So that’s another two months lost.”
Says DM Jha, “We have to be ready for all outcomes. We will ensure there is no breakdown of law and order.”

There are no accurate figures of the death toll in the violence before and after the Babri demolition. While nobody remembers any Hindu-Muslim riots in the town, the memory of those days, changing the country’s politics, lingers.
Gayatri Pandey, 50, lost her husband Ramesh Pandey when police fired on karsevaks trying to storm Babri Masjid in 1990. Sitting on the floor of her dingy home in Rani Bazaar, she smiles as her five-year-old grandson Athar, sitting in her lap, quips, “Mandir ka nirmaan hoga (The temple will be built).”
The family, including Ramesh’s four children, got Rs 2 lakh after his death. Gayatri says the real tribute to her husband would be a temple. “I have waited for too long, 27 years… Everyone forgot about us. When the verdict comes, I hope my husband’s sacrifice will be remembered. At least my sons should be given government jobs.” Her older son works at the VHP’s Ram Mandir Karyashala.
Sandeep Kumar Gupta (30) and sister Seema Gupta (35), whose father died in the 1990 firing too, barely make ends meet running a small clothes shop. Insisting a temple should be built, Sandeep says, “Ram is our identity. What Mecca is to Muslims, Ramjanmabhoomi is for us.”
In another part of town, Mohd Naeem is hoping his 16-year-old nephew Sadiq’s death in the violence following the Babri demolition, among the 15 Muslims reportedly killed, doesn’t turn out to be in vain. “Our homes were burnt. Sadiq was pulled out and beaten to death,” says the 51-year-old driver and father of six.

(Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)
Brushing aside his 18-year-old son’s attempts to hush him, Naeem says, “Kyon nahin bolein (Why shouldn’t we speak)?. The new generation is unaware of those times, they just want to study and get jobs. But we are waiting for the judgment. Abhi tak hamari koi sunwai nahin hui hai, ab ummeed hai ki hamein insaaf milega (No one has heard our pleas so far. I hope we get justice now).”
Tarannum, 30, who lost her father Shaukatullah in the post-Babri violence, is reluctant to talk. Speaking from behind a door, she says, “Bas masla sulajh jaye (The matter should just be resolved). It’s been going on for too long.”
Sharad Sharma is the Ayodhya spokesperson of the VHP, the Sangh Parivar outfit that played a prominent role in the temple movement. While he admits that passion for the temple is dwindling, he says technology makes up for it. “Earlier, the Bajrang Dal (the VHP’s youth wing) had 25 lakh members, now we have over 70 lakh. With Twitter, Facebook, this generation will take the movement forward. And now we see youngsters celebrating Durga Puja, Ganesh Puja. They know our history.”
Work has been on at the VHP’s Ram Janmabhoomi Karyashala at ‘Karsevak-
puram’, over a kilometre away from the disputed site, since 1990, on stones to be used in the proposed temple. But since the lone artisan passed away recently, work is at a halt. Many of the stones have gathered moss. Says Sharma, “Around 65% of the work is complete… We are waiting for the judgment.”
Like several others, Deepak Kumar Saini, 25, has come to offer his services at the Karsevakpuram this time of the year, taking a break from his regular job, at a mobile repair shop. Distributing food at a ‘Dussehra bhandara’, he says, “Mandir aur vikas saath aayenge (Temple and development will come together). Already, roads are being widened, loose hanging wires are underground… Ayodhya has no problems now.”

A few metres away, at a school run by the VHP, 35 students between the ages of 12 and 17, from Ayodhya and nearby areas, recite verses from the Yajur Veda. Asked by their teacher Narad Bhattarai, 30, if they want a temple, they respond with a loud “haan (yes)”.
The students have a packed schedule, starting 4 am, studying the Vedas and English, Maths, Social Science. The school, from Class 5 onwards, accepts them after an entrance test, and they go on to clear Class 10 and 12 through open board. Bhattarai, one of five teachers at the school, says most go on to pursue higher studies at institutions such as Banaras Hindu University.
Gyanendra Mishra, 15, a Class 10 student, says he wants to become a “Ram Kathavachak (story-teller)”. As other children tease him, he hits back, “No, not a sadhu (priest)! Kathavachak.”
Ten kilometres away, on the Ayodhya-Faizabad border, is located Muslim Yateem Khaana Madrasa. One of the biggest madrasas in the region, it has around 50 students, with as packed a schedule. Asked about the coming judgment, most are wary of speaking.
Teacher Mohd Haseeb, who points out that his students study the Quran as well as Maths, English and Urdu, asserts, “Religion has nothing to do with education at this madrasa.” He adds, “Whatever the verdict is, we will accept it. Bas dhokha nahin hona chahiye (Only, we should not be cheated). We saw how the Babri Masjid was felled…”
Most Muslims, Haseeb adds, are driven by a sense of fatigue and resignation. With little political representation and dwindling space to express their views, the community has learnt to keep to itself, he says. “A verdict in our favour will bring some closure.”
Around 20 students gathered around him nod. Refusing to be named, one of them says, “It is important to put the issue to rest. We want a mosque.”

Mohd Shehzad, a local meat-seller, who is visiting the madrasa, says while he too agrees that “the (RJB) land is ours”, he is scared about what will follow the judgment, “because of the way the media has been portraying our community”. “I saw what happened in 1992, I don’t want it to happen again,” says the father of three.
Around this time of the year, the echo of any tension, anywhere outside is the loudest in Ayodhya. Shehzad has opened his shop today after nine days of Navratras. “Now we hear even meat shops on the outskirts of the town will be shut down. It’s my only source of income,” he worries.
So, like the others, the 50-year-old has decided what’s best for his children. “I didn’t let them join my shop. They are all studying and will hopefully get jobs outside.”

Till then, Xiaomi, the Big Bazaar store at Ayodhya and the Reliance Trends Mall at Faizabad will have to do.
At the Xiaomi store, Srivastav says they sell about 180 handsets every month, mostly for Rs 8,000-10,000, to mainly youngsters. For now happy with the Rs 20,000 a month he earns at the store, he hopes to eventually join the Uttar Pradesh Police. “After working from 11 am to 8 pm, I study till 2 am, then go for coaching in the morning. I want a government job, it will give me stability… I wouldn’t think twice before leaving town,” says Srivastav, the eldest of three siblings of a farming family.

His colleague Ali, whose father runs a hair saloon nearby, wants to set up his own business after gaining enough “experience”. “I started working at 17. I searched job sites, but there were no Ayodhya-based posts. I was too young to leave. But now, if something comes up, I will leave,” he says, adding he earns Rs 15,000 every month.
Shivangi Kanojia, 18, started working at the Big Bazaar outlet, located on the outskirts of Ayodhya, last month. The daughter of a daily wager, she says, “I have three brothers, but they are no good. Since I passed out of Class 12, all I have been worried about is getting a job.”
The only thing she knew about the Big Bazaar job was that “it would be an air-conditioned office with a good salary”. She grabbed it, seeing it as a step up from her hospital job helping nursing staff. Now she cycles 6 km from home, for a shift of 9 am to 9 pm with one day off, working in the security department of the three-storey store.
A day after Dussehra, the store that opened a month ago is buzzing, including with customers wearing the saffron garb of sadhus. The bestsellers, the staff of over 70 say, are face wash, almonds and women’s kurtas.
Dressed in a bottle-green uniform, Kanojia says she earns Rs 8,000 a month. “I check bills, bags, and guard the offices. This job has been very helpful for my family.” She has no time to worry about the Ram Mandir agitation, she adds. “But if it brings better jobs, I am for it.”
The Reliance Trends Mall in Faizabad came up in February. Aditya Yadav, 29, its assistant store manager, says the sales have been “awesome”. “People outside Ayodhya have a certain perception, that this town is all about Ram Mandir… But in Ayodhya we are moving forward,” says the local resident, who earlier had a job with Vodafone.

Guiding customers around the Indian wear sections, he says the store gets around 500 customers daily, going up to 1,300 at times. “We are already in the process of opening a new store… Most of our customers are families, and many are from the Army’s Dogra Regiment stationed nearby. Not many youngsters….”
Store manager Shyam Singh says the Ayodhya posting has been an “eye-opener”. “Last year when I was doing market research before the outlet’s opening, I found that most homes had grilles around their windows. I presumed it was precautionary, for a clash or curfew… Later, I found it was to keep monkeys away,” he laughs. “We have heard there will be Ola service here soon.”

Change has also breached another religion frontier: the Ramlilas. On Dussehra day, towards the evening, most streets are deserted, with only a few men heading to the Ayodhya Ramlila Mahotsav Samiti’s Ramlila at Rajendra Niwas — one of the three in town, and the oldest. The groups of young men who have been gyrating to racy Bhojpuri tunes through the day, accompanying Durga Puja idols headed for visarjan, have dissipated.
The crowds are not what they used to be, laments the Rajendra Niwas Ramlila owner, Awadh Kishore Pathak. The few gathered around the small make-shift stage today, mostly women and children, are complaining about the insects drawn to the lights. In one corner, stands a large bamboo Ravan, surrounded by a few boys taking selfies.
Pathak believes phones are to blame for the lack of audience. “The youth watch everything on their phone, even Ramayan. Why would they come for the show?”

Ratnesh Shukla, the 26-year-old father of two who plays Ram, Laxman as well as Sita at the Ramlila, getting Rs 20,000 for 10 days of performance, insists things will change. “Jaldi sab clear ho jayega (Soon, everything will be clear). You should come for the Ramlila next year. The place will be full. Now we are all just waiting.”
But who says the Ayodhya show has to end?
In Aasif Baag on Ayodhya’s outskirts, Raju Prajapati is at work at his potter’s wheel, to churn out “10,000 diyas” by Diwali, for “Rs 100 per 70 diyas” — an order from the state government. “Like Ram and Sita lived in Hanuman’s heart, Ayodhya lives in the heart of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogiji,” the 25-year-old graduate, who joined the family profession after trying his hand at “everything”, beams. “We have to make four lakh diyas this time. Yogiji se direct baat hui hamari (I spoke directly to the CM).”

‘Run for unity’ is being organised in various parts of the country Wednesday to commemorate the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, even as the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, was unveiled in Gujarat.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh flagged off the run in the national capital. His colleagues Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Sports and I&B Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore participated in the run in different states.

In Tamil Nadu, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, participating in the run, said it’s only fair to remember Sardar Patel today, who worked hard to make India one post independence.
“Post our freedom movement, Sardar Patel worked hard to get more than 550 princely states together to make India one. It’s only right that we remember him today,” ANI quoted her as saying.

 

In Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda flagged off the run, while Rajyavardhan Rathore participated in the national capital. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar will flag-off a “Run for Unity” programme in Sirsa."

Gordhan Zadaphia, who was Gujarat Minister of State for Home in 2002 when the state witnessed the worst communal riots, wants to “put the past behind” as he gears up for his new political assignment as the BJP man in-charge of the party’s electioneering in Uttar Pradesh for the next Lok Sabha elections, due in few months.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Zadaphia, who had returned to the BJP just ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after spending nearly a decade out of the party, said that the new assignment reflects the party leadership’s trust in him. “It is their (party leadership) trust in me. Nothing else…My job is that of a party worker, and achieve success for the party.”
Zadaphia, a Leuva Patel, said the decision to appoint him in-charge of UP along with two others, was made “by Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the (BJP) high command”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The crucial political assignment to Zadaphia by BJP chief Amit Shah comes at a time when the RSS has sidelined former VHP leader Pravin Togadia who he was close to; and former CM Keshubhai Patel, in whose party Zadaphia was general secretary, has retired from active politics.
Zadaphia, who had launch Maha Gujarat Janata  Parishad in 2007 to challenge the leadership of the then chief minister Narendra Modi on the ground that “Patidars were being sidelined”, however, asserted that as prime minister, Modi has fulfilled all the promises that he had made in the run-up to the last Lok Sabha elections, and pointed to the completion of the Statue of Unity project to buttress his claim. He also praised Modi for Swachh Bharat, the cleanliness campaign, and “including the poor into the banking system”.
In 2010, Zadaphia was called for testifying before the Supreme Court-appointed SIT, which was probing nine riot cases and the complaint filed by Zakia Jafri, the wife of MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre. Zakia had named 62 persons, including Modi and Zadaphia, for omission and commission during the riots.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Since his return to the BJP four years ago, Zadaphia was made general secretary of BJP kisan morcha, and was assigned responsibility in Jharkhand Assembly elections. He is at present vice-president of Gujarat unit of the BJP.

The rehabilitation of Zadaphia, who belongs to Bhavnagar, in the BJP was clear when he was given the responsibility of organising the second edition of the Gaurav Yatra ahead of the last year’s Assembly elections in Gujarat. “The organisation is my mother, and I will safeguard it,” he said, refusing to spell out his plan for the BJP in UP."

In fact,the Vadodara International Marathon 2013, which was scheduled to be held on December 1,has now been postponed to December 15. The decision was taken by the Vadodara Marathon directors late on Monday,citing clearance issues. However,the presence of Modi at the event seems to be the prime reason for the change of date.
Apart from the approval for a full marathon by the Association of International Marathons,the managing committee also wanted to ensure the presence of Ethiopian runners who were facing a hurdle in getting visas to India during the first week of December. The runners are an important part of Vadodara Marathon. If they are not present,the flair will be gone. The change of date will ensure their presence, says a member. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

The Vadodara Marathon was launched by ace athlete P T Usha.  
An official of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust said,Run for Unity,involving various local organisations,will be held at every taluka and city in Gujarat. The trust is building the Statue of Unity at Sadhu Island,3.2 km from Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia Colony. The efforts are also on to organise it outside the state on the same day on December 15, he added.

During the event,Modi also reiterated his appeal to the farmers to contribute iron to build the Statue of Unity in memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Hitting out at the Centre for failing to control inflation,Modi said,The Delhi government does not think about rise of inflation in the country. Two and half years ago,Prime Minister had requested all the states to give suggestions on how to eradicate inflation in the country. We have also submitted report of 64 points and opinions in which action could be taken. But till now,nothing has been done.

CM dedicates VMC projects to Barodians
Amidst the chant of Vote for PM, Chief Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday dedicated several projects of the civic body,including two flyovers,to the Barodians.  
Modi,who is back from the BJPs national executive meet in Goa,where he was selected by the party as its election campaign chairman,was greeted by his supporters as he reached here. Supporters came out on the road in large number,shouting slogans like Dekho Dekho Kaun Aaya,Bharat Ka CM Aaya, and Vote for PM.
Young supporters followed Modis cavalcade on motorcycles from the airport to the venue where he addressed the public. In between,he inaugurated a flyover built at the cost of Rs 31 crore from Swarnim Jayanti CM Urban Development Project fund. His supporters shouted PM,PM incessantly as he entered the venue where he was to deliver his address.
This enthusiasm is an indication of what is to follow in 2014, he said amid loud cheer. Before addressing the public,he inaugurate several projects of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC),including a yet another flyover,a public health laboratory,municipal ward offices,call centre,smart classes,Anganwadi Kendras,Kaushalya Talim Kendra (for training),and a hydraulic elevated platform.
In his speech,he reverted to Congress bashing,highlighting its TV commercial,saying that the disease called Congress will have to go for the actual Bharat Nirman. Common man has lost his faith in the Congress-led Central government,with something or the other happening everyday that breaks the peoples faith in the government. This disease named Congress will have to go, he said.
He then elaborated on how the facilities given to the government will help uplift urban poverty. 
The CM said Gujarat government was trying to equip municipal corporations across  state with modern facilities.

Statue of Unity inauguration LIVE Updates
The Rs 2,989 crore project took 42 months, and round-the-clock work by 3,400 labourers and 250 engineers to complete. The foundation stone of the statue was laid in October 2013 by Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at that time. The Statue of Unity beats China’s ‘Spring Temple Buddha’ as the world’s tallest statue.

The statue, however, has drawn flak from tribals and farmers living in the region who were against the enormous cost of the project as well as land acquisition by the government.

Former Gujarat minister Gordhan Zadaphia, who had fallen out with Narendra Modi and launched a party in 2007, was last week handpicked by BJP president Amit Shah as one the three leaders in-charge for the party’s electioneering in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, where it is facing a tough challenge from the Samajawadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party that are likely to forge an alliance. With Zadaphia getting the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh, many see it as the political resurrection of a former VHP leader who had quit the BJP after being sidelined by the party following the 2002 riots when he was the Minister of State for Home, only to return to the party fold in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, five years ago. The Indian Express speaks to him about his new assignment and his plans for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.
Your task for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh will be that of party president Amit Shah’s role in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when BJP saw a resounding victory, winning 71 of 80 seats in the state. How do you see it?
There is a team of people, and we will work together. I cannot compare myself with Amitbhai (Shah). He has succeeded in expanding the party’s base across the country, including the Northeast. I have never compared myself with the organisational skills of Amitbhai. We have worked together, and definitely one would like to achieve success… Amitbhai’s ability is proven, while we are yet to prove ourselves.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The decision of the BJP arouses curiosity, considering your background. Your comments?
Forget it. Those days are over… Ups and downs are always there in life.




	Also Read: ‘Putting past behind’, Gordhan Zadaphia gears up for poll assignment in UP



What is your plan for Uttar Pradesh? What would be your priority there?
I will know the plan when I go there (UP). First, I will be going to Delhi. I have not been to Uttar Pradesh on political assignments in the past. But I have been there on many occasions to attend social and personal programmes… I have been to villages of BJP workers there when I was general secretary (of the BJP). I have visited their homes, attended weddings. The people of Gujarat and UP are well connected.
Were you associated with the Ram temple movement in the 1990s?
No No… Everyone knows I was with the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) prior to 1990s. There is nothing to hide. I was its secretary. Thereafter, I have been in the BJP where I worked with (former Gujarat minister) Ashok Bhatt as general secretary of party’s Ahmedabad city unit, Gujarat unit general secretary when I was an MLA… Most of my life was spent in the organisation.
So, the highest position for you was being the Minister of State for Home in Gujarat during 2002?
Organisational post is the highest. Getting ministerial position is outcome of the organisation.
Why do you think you have been given the assignment of UP by the BJP leadership?
I don’t know. It is their trust in me. Nothing else.
Do you think it is also because the Ram temple movement is building up again in the country, particularly UP?
No no… just trust in me as a (BJP) worker — nothing more, and nothing else.
But are you going to give a push to Ram temple movement ahead of the Lok Sabha elections?
See, this is not my job. My job is that of a party worker, and achieve success for the party.
Would you have preferred to stay in Gujarat for the Lok Sabha elections?
We are soldiers. Soldiers have no choice. I am a party worker and will work wherever posted. Nothing personal about it.
There is a view that you were given the UP assignment to keep you out of Gujarat.
I don’t believe it. Whatever task is given is as important, and I accept it. The organisation is my mother, and I will safeguard it.
How will you put behind those years when you fought the BJP? Your statement before the SIT (which was probing the 2002 riot cases. Zadaphia’s name was in the list of the accused in the petition of Zakia Jafri in Gulberg Society massacre ) and so on?
I have already forgotten the past. I don’t want to remember it. I don’t want to comment anything. Let me work for the party till I am alive.
There would be many who stayed loyal to the party and may have aspired for this assignment.
Our honourable Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and our national BJP president Amit bhai (Shah) and the high command… they choose the people for assignments. This is an opportunity and challenge for us.
Minorities don’t feel secure in UP today.
You know the (triple talaq) Bill has been passed (in Lok Sabha). This is a landmark (law) for the women of minority community. This gives them self respect and safeguards their life. Now, no one can throw out a beloved member of the family. This is the greatest work done for the women of the minority community.
How will your presence in UP assuage the minorities?
We are inclusive. We don’t discriminate, by caste or community. Our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) always says Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
But the events that played out in UP don’t reflect that, like the lynchings.
These are all creations. This is all I can say. Certain things are happening, no doubt everywhere, but this does not mean that our party is supporting it. Our party never supported this kind of thing which is discriminatory.
You are seen close to former VHP leader Pravin Togadia, who has now been sidelined.
I don’t want to comment. I am with the party.
Which government programmes will you showcase to the people of UP?
Seventy years of Independence could not give the nation proper sanitation. That is one remarkable job done by Narendrabhai (Modi), the uplift of poor, including them in the banking system. And most importantly, what farmers will not realise today — the scientific calculation of the minimum support price (MSP) based on rate of inflation and expenditure by farmers, has been done for the first time since Independence, and it will play a great role in the future.
What value do you think the Statue of Unity added to the nation?
It is landmark for a man who united the nation, and it is the duty of the people to honour him. And the world has seen the achievement of Narendrabhai Modi. Whatever he promised in 2013, it has been fulfilled.
Will you contest Lok Sabha elections?
My party will decide on it."

On the second day of his roadshow, which passed through Patidar-dominated areas of Saurashtra in Gujarat, Congress vice-president tried to woo the community by directly addressing them in small gatherings and telling them that if the Congress copmes to power, the government will not fire on them. He was referring to the police firing on Patidar youths during their 2015 agitation for quota in jobs and educational institutions.
“We (Congress) work in an environment of love and fraternity. We take everybody along. It is our promise that we shall take everybody along and take Gujarat forward,” Rahul said at Dhrol town of Jamnagar.
While state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said it was time for “revenge for the atrocities on Patidars”, Rahul said, “You gave Sardar Patel to the country. Gujarat gave Sardar Patel to the country. (Now) you have to show a way to entire country. Only Gujarat, and no other state can do it.” Rahul criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel, saying that the PM was promoting “Make in India”, but had given out the work of building the statue to China. “This is a matter of shame,” the Connress leader said."

The structure was to be part of a dinosaur park to be inaugurated on October 31, apart from 30 more projects, to mark the one-year anniversary of the world’s tallest statue.

Forest Conservator Sasi Kumar claimed the dinosaur model that collapsed was being assembled “only to test its strength”. Dismissing allegations regarding its cost, he said, “The entire project, which includes a sound and light show as well as a nature trail, costs Rs 60 lakh. How can a 30-ft model of a dinosaur made of fibreglass cost Rs 2 crore?”
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) Managing Director Rajeev Kumar Gupta said they would now make changes in the steel reinforcement of the dinosaur statues in order to make them stronger. He ruled out any other design change.
Rajasaurus narmadensis is known to have walked this region around 65 million years ago. About 170 km from Kevadia is Raiyoli in Mahisagar district, known to be the world’s third largest fossil site and second largest dinosaur hatchery, from where thousands of dinosaur eggs were recovered."

Addressing a public meeting to mark the culmination of a padyatra taken out to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, at Sanasoara village in Bhavnagar district, Rupani said: “The PM (Modi) had paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, by unveiling projects related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, B R Ambedkar and Vir Savarkar.
Rupani also said that to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the state government was running a number of schemes for the poor and the downtrodden, along with taking up cleanliness drive.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
PM Modi, who also addressed the gathering at the concluding ceremony of the march organised by Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya through video conference, said that the sense of duty among people before Independence has now turned into a sense of entitlement.
Modi urged citizens as well as social and political leaders to draw inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi and take up the cause of cleanliness as a mass movement.
“Mahatma Gandhi always stressed on duty. However, after Independence, this sense of duty turned into a sense of entitlement. For the development of our country, we need both of them today,” the PM said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(Reuters)
The BJP’s iron collection programme for its Statue of Unity project has failed to meet deadline in the state’s 28 districts, owing mainly to “dereliction of party workers who were assigned the responsibility of collecting at least one kg of iron from each gram panchayat”.
The programme, launched by party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to build a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on an island along the Narmada river in Gujarat, began in UP on January 7 with February 10 being the deadline for six BJP regions comprising 68 districts and February 20 for two others regions comprising 22 districts.
Based on the figures so far, the iron was collected from only 268 villages of all 528 gram panchayats. No iron was collected from 172 villages in Jhansi and 235 villages in Rae Bareli.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Likewise, BJP workers also did not collect iron from 284 villages in Allahabad, followed by Jaunpur (264), Unnao (188), Lakhimpur Kheri (180), Pratapgarh (194), Bulandshahr (164), Sitapur (129), Moradabad (113), Rampur (80) and Meerut (59).
Meerut is BJP state president Laxmikant Bajpai’s home district. Among others, iron-collection drive was not carried out in 90 villages of Varanasi, senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi’s constituency, and in 49 villages of Pilibhit – party national general secretary Varun Gandhi’s constituency. The party has also left out 80 villages in Etawah.
State convener of iron collection coordination committee in UP, Om Prakash Singh said, “Iron was not collected because of laxity of workers.” He added that adequate efforts were not made to draw the support from people.
Singh, however, termed response from Farrukhabad, Kannuaj, Badaun, Faizabad, Mirzapur, Amethi, Sultanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Ghaziabad and Baghpat as satisfactory.
Citizen for Accountable Governance (CAG), a non-profit organisation, has been assigned the responsibility to deliver the collection kits (comprising the iron collected under the drive).Lucknow NewsVoting for UP panchayat polls beginsNames of BSP govt projects being changed due to casteist prejudice: MayawatiGovt working on Ambedkar’s principles to ensure benefits to all without discrimination: Yogi AdityanathClick here for more

However, top officials in the Secretariat say that the PM seems certain about visiting the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya Colony in Narmada on October 31.“The PM has declared to celebrate October 31 as Rashtriya Ekta Divas (RED). Last year, he had started the celebration with armed forces at SoU. This year, he looks certain to visit the SoU for the RED celebration to take it to a level of Republic Day celebrations,” said a senior IAS officer.

August 25 marked the fifth year of the Patidar reservation agitation. Garnering national attention in 2015, the agitation had catapulted Hardik Patel as a youth leader when he addressed a massive rally at GMDC ground in Ahmedabad. Violence had erupted and left 14 Patidars dead owing to police action. On Tuesday, Hardik greeted Patidar community members on social media for the “historic revolution”. Now the working president of Gujarat Congress, Hardik listed three benefits of the agitation: Mukhyamantri Swavlamban Yojana, 10% reservation on economic grounds and relaxation of five years in age limit for government jobs for communities without social reservation. On Wednesday, Hardik recollected August 26, 2015 as “Patidar Shahid Din” even as tree plantation programmes were held in Gandhinagar, Mehsana and Rajkot to pay homage to those killed."

State govt plans to acquire 25 hectares of land allotted to Somnath temple trust
AHMEDABAD: Criticising Chief Minister Narendra Modis comments that secularism of Sardar Patel did not come in his way of building Somnath Temple,former state Congress president Siddharth Patel said that while Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as Indias first Union Home Minister had allotted 250 hectares of land to the Somnath Temple Trust for development of the area on lease for a period of 999 years,The Modi government was taking back 25 hectares of it after creation of a new Gir-Somnath district.
Addressing mediapersons at the state party headquarters here on Thursday,he said that after annexing Junagadh state into Saurashtra on October 12,1947,the then Saurashtra state government on Sardar Patels orders had allotted the land to the temple trust.
But Modi government is demanding back 25 hectares of it and Gir-Somnath district collector had written a letter to the trust on October 8,2013 in this connection, he claimed.
Modi is doing politics in the name of Sardar Patel, the Congress leader said.
There is a vast difference in the words and the deeds of Modi and the Somnath temple trust land acquisition incident is an ample proof of this, he added.
He also displayed a copy of the letter which says that no land is available at Somnath for construction of offices for district collector,district police and district development officer.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The foundation stone of the project was laid by the then CM Narendra Modi on October 31, 2013, and a work order of Rs 2,979 crore was given to Larsen & Toubro in October last year. Work on the construction of the Rs 176 crore Shreshtha Bharat Bhawan, a part of the project, has begun and the construction of the statue is likely to begin soon.
Activists have written to the secretary of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, asking him to direct the state government and the agencies involved in the construction of the project — the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) and the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) — to stop construction work with “immediate effect” in the absence of clarity on environmental impact assessment of the project, or face legal action.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We will look forward to your urgent action and also point-wise response to all our letters. Thus we call on you to cease all Statue of Unity Project activities and not commence further work until the due process of environmental clearance is undertaken. If project activities are not immediately stopped, you will invite immediate legal action,” the activists wrote.
They have argued that the construction work on the project requires environmental clearance as it is situated in an ecologically and environmentally sensitive zone and have said that being situated on the boundary of the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, the project will put extra load on a geological fault line area and will affect the river and the biodiversity also by bringing in lakhs of tourists to the ecologically sensitive zone.
“This raises the issue of safety and stability of the project. The government claims to having conducted a seismic hazard study of the project by its in-house Institute of Seismological Research, but the study is not valid unless peer review is conducted. The study has not even been made public. We believe construction activity is illegal in the absence of environment clearance from the union ministry as it violates Environment Protection Act, 1986, and the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of September 2006, as well as orders of the NGT and various other courts. We will take legal recourse so that the government reveals its stand on an important aspect of the mega project,” said activist Trupti Shah, who is one of the 22 activists who have taken the fight against the statue to court.
“We wrote to various government departments concerned four times and filed RTI applications but did not get any clear information. So the only option left is legal recourse,” she said. A copy of the letter has also been marked to L&T. The SSNNL maintains that the project does not require environment clearance. Activists have maintained that the SSNNL is not the right authority to decide on the issue of environment clearance.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
The ongoing construction of Garudeshwar Weir downstream of the proposed site of the statue has already been challenged by environment activists in the NGT for not seeking environment clearance and next hearing is scheduled on February 4. The Union MoEF had in its previous affidavit before the NGT maintained that the project never came before it for clearance. It has again stated that the project does not require environment clearance as it is a part of the Sardar Sarovar Project."

As the opening ceremony of the 49th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) progressed, it seemed like a platform to promote India as a destination for filmmakers. In between entertainment acts and announcements related to the festival, pitches were made to draw tourists to Gujarat and Goa. Jharkhand was presented as a “film-friendly” state.
Held on Tuesday at Goa’s Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium, the ceremony focussed on the government’s initiative “Film in India”. Under this, India was projected as a perfect destination for foreign filmmakers, with a promise to “ease the process for those who come to film their projects in India”. The Gujarat tourism publicity featured the Statue of Unity as the main attraction, and a short film listed the incentives rolled out by Jharkhand.
The ceremony began with a tribute to period dramas in Indian cinema. A medley of songs played out, as dancers swayed under stobe lights, making it a spectacular show. Playback singer Shilpa Rao performed a number of songs, from Rabindranath Tagore’s Ogo Bideshini to Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s ghazal popularised by Farida Khanum, Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo.
Filmmaker Karan Johar, who is part of the IFFI steering committee, held a Koffee with Karan-style question-and-answer session with Rajyavardhan Rathore, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and actor Akshay Kumar. During the session, Kumar was quizzed about Rathore’s achievements and the minister was asked to recall the number of “Khiladi” movies the actor has featured in.

(File)
Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu while addressing an event at Anand in Gujarat on Saturday, said that Congress was primarily “a movement of people of different ideologies” which Mahatma Gandhi had suggested to be disbanded.
“Mahatma Gandhi gave two suggestions after independence. First, he asked for the closure of the Congress as a platform. I am telling you for your information that the Congress party was primarily a unit where people of different ideologies gathered under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhiji, Gopal Krishna Gokhaleji, Bal Gangadhar Tilakji and Dadabhai Naoroji with a goal to achieve freedom,” Naidu said at the 40th Foundation Day of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA). “They came together and fought for independence. When independence was achieved, the work was finished and there was no need for any discussion.”
He said the second suggestion of the Mahatma was asking people to “go back to villages.” “Unfortunately, we have shown our backs to the villages,” he said, adding that 60 per cent of the India still lives in villages.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The VP claimed that the Ayodhya verdict was being celebrated by people. “People are happy over a meaningful solution because we have put an end to these things behind and moved on. The solution has been welcomed by one and all,” he said about the November 9 verdict of the Supreme Court, which backed the construction of a Ram temple and gave a five-acre plot for a mosque to be built.
Commenting on the prices of onions prevailing in the country, he said, “Sometimes low price, tears in eyes. Sometimes high price, again tears in eyes.”
Naidu also visited the native home of the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, at Karmsad, a few kilometres from Anand.
He also recalled the contribution made by Verghese Kurien, who is known as the Father of White Revolution. “I salute his memory, foresight, and the initiatives he had taken. The regions where this Amul movement reached are developed and other areas are comparatively less developed. It’s not only a beautiful but also a dutiful place. It was here that white revolution was conceptualised and implemented. India is today the world’s largest producer of milk,” Naidu said.
Naidu remembered former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s initiative to build rural roads, and said that the next phase of the movement to provide clean drinking water and toilets was undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in addition to highlighting the need for water conservation.
“Water crisis is possible in the coming days. In fact it can be seen even now, but we are not paying much attention to it. Joining rivers, cleaning them, conserving lakes, and reducing, reusing and recycling water is a vital mantra,” he said.
The VP appealed to people to participate in projects undertaken by the government. “The country has this mentality that every work will be done by government and we can sit idle. This will not do. Whether it is Clean India Clean Water programme, or ‘Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao’, ‘Fitness India’, or Yoga, all these programmes should become people’s programmes, with people’s participation, and this is vital for their success,” he said.
“Proper training and mentoring is a pre-requisite to turn village farmers into successful entrepreneurs,” the VP said while highlighting the importance of institutes like IRMA. “White Revolution was achieved not by mass production, but production by masses. This helped small and marginal farmers to reap the benefits of the economy of scale.”
On Sunday, Naidu is scheduled to attend the convocation of Sardar Patel University at Vallabh Vidyanagar and also confer the President’s Police Colours to Gujarat police at the Police Academy at Karai, Gandhinagar. Later in the day, he is expect to proceed to Dhordo in Kutch district to participate in the Rann Utsav.
‘History has not done justice to Sardar Patel’
Naidu also spoke at the inauguration of Charutar Vidya Mandir (CVM) University near Karamsad, the native village of Sardar Patel in Anand district.
“Sardar Patel believed freedom without economic prosperity and social reform would rob India’s independence of its true meaning,” he said.
“Unfortunately, history has not done justice to the personality and contribution of this great son of this great country. But now, fortunately, we are recognising it,” Naidu said.
Patel wanted to bridge the urban-rural divide and he “re-focussed country’s attention on rural development” in line with Mahatma Gandhi’s ideal of ‘Ram Rajya’ (the perfect state), he said. Future generations must be taught to remember Sardar Patel “with respect and gratitude and understand his grand vision,” he added.
Talking about the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Narmada district of Gujarat, Naidu said, “I am told, and am happy to know, his statue is receiving double the number of visitors (as compared to) Statue of Liberty in America. Whoever visits India must visit Sardar Patel’s statue and know about his contribution.”
Naidu also said that the country needs to keep growing “to meet the growing expectations of people”.
Naidu presented an award to L&T group chairman A M Naik on behalf of CVM for being an illustrious alumnus of the institution. Naik, a Padma Vibhushan awardee, is also the chairman of the National Skill Development Corporation.
Naik, whose company built the Statue of Unity, termed it a “miracle”.
“Anyone who has not gone there must go. And take the elevator to the top and be on the top of the world,” he said.

Officials say Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to fly in the first 14-seater amphibian flight that will eventually be open to the public. The other spots are, Dharoi dam in Mehsana district, to connect Ambaji and Shatrunjay dam in Palitana of Bhavnagar district as well as Tapi in the next phase.
Construction of the terminals at both ends is almost complete with prefabricated structures and a complete glass facade. From the proposed terminal building, the passengers will use a 3-metre long aluminum gangway, hop on to the floating walkway and reach the docking pad of the sea plane.
What is India’s first seaplane project?
The first seaplane project of the country is part of a directive of the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation. As per the directive, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) requested state governments of Gujarat, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the administration of Andaman & Nicobar to propose potential locations for setting up water aerodromes to boost the tourism sector.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
A seaplane is a fixed-winged aeroplane designed for taking off and landing on water. It offers the public the speed of an aeroplane with the utility of a boat. There are two main types of seaplane: flying boats (often called hull seaplanes) and floatplanes. The bottom of a flying boat’s fuselage is its main landing gear. This is usually supplemented with smaller floats near the wingtips, called wing or tip floats. The hull of a flying boat holds the crew, passengers, and cargo; it has many eatures in common with the hull of a ship or a boat.

Where will the seaplane connect?
In Kevadia, the proposed Terminal will be spread over 0.51 acres in the premises of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd., located in the Panchmuli lake (Dyke 3) of the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Limdi village. It is approximately 90 kms from Vadodara, 150 kms from Surat and 200 kms from Ahmedabad — with an aerial distance of 74.6km from Vadodara airport. The Terminal building will have a plinth area of 340 m and will be equipped with provision of all modern amenities, including two check-in counters, one ticketing, facilitation and concessionaires counters on the land side. A daily inflow of 200 passengers is estimated as per the proposal.
How will the service function?
Officials say that SpiceJet will operate a 19-seater plane, which will be able to accommodate 14 passengers. SpiceJet said the company has entered into a contract with a French company, which overtook the original Japanese manufacturer of 10-14 seater seaplanes. Officials of SpiceJet, who did not want to be named, said that Spicejet has been conducting trials with different models of seaplanes in Mumbai since over a year and two seaplanes have already arrived in Mumbai from where they will be brought to Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad before the October 31 launch.
“There will be four flights a day between Ahmedabad and Kevadia on each side — which means four arrivals and four departures. The ticket price per person will be about Rs.4,800. Anyone wishing to cut down on their travel time between Ahmedabad and Kevadia which currently takes about four hours one way, can do so by turning it into a day’s trip. Return tickets can be booked on the seaplane to ensure that the passengers can return to Ahmedabad from Kevadia during the day. The journey by seaplane will be about one hour,” the official said. Fuelling and maintenance of the seaplanes will be carried out at the Ahmedabad airport.
What impact will it have on the environment?
The water aerodrome is not a listed project/activity in the Schedule to the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 and its amendments. However, the Expert Appraisal Committee was of the opinion that the activities proposed under the water aerodrome project may have a similar type of impact as that of an airport.
In Narmada, the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary is located at an approximate aerial distance of 2.1 km from the proposed project site in south-west direction while the nearest reserve forest is situated at a distance of 4.7 meters in east direction, which serves local sensitive species of fauna.
The bathymetric and hydrographic survey was conducted by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) before finalising Dyke 3, which is a rock-filled pond and popularly called the ‘Magar Talav’ as it is infested with crocodiles. Work on evacuating crocodiles from the lake has been on since January 2019, after which mesh fencing of the boundary was also completed to prevent crocodiles from re-entering from the connecting Dyke 1 and 2.
The site was finalised for the terminal as its dimensions suit the requirements of landing the seaplane, which requires a minimum width of 900 metres in a water body with a depth of at least six feet. Senior engineers of SSNNL added that while a seaplane does not require any construction of a runway, rubber buoys have been lined up to indicate the landing path for the seaplane.
In its proposal seeking environmental clearance, the Director of Aviation, Government of Gujarat, has allayed fears of environmental impact during the stage of construction. In terms of the long-term effects of the seaplane service, the government has said, “During seaplane operations, there will be turbulence created in the water while takeoff and landing of seaplanes. This will lead to more operation process i.e. mixing of oxygen in the water. This will have a positive impact on the aquatic ecosystem near seaplane operations increasing oxygen content and decreasing carbon content in this system.”

Where else do seaplanes operate?
Seaplanes by multiple airline carriers are operational in countries like the Philippines, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Maldives and Hongkong.
In India, Jal Hans, a commercial seaplane service based in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was launched as a pilot project on 30 December 2010 by the then Indian Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel with a capacity of 10 passengers."

The farmers,from 29 states and two Union Territories across the country,were hosted as state guests for three days. Lodged in two-three star hotels for what the Narendra Modi government claimed was the first such event in the country,the farmers couldnt have hoped for a better paid-for retreat.
For 38-year-old Mrinal Das,a farmer from Kurivill village in Barpeta district of Assam,a trip to Gandhinagar to attend the summit turned into a journey of his lifetime. I had never stepped outside my district. In fact,I boarded a train for the first time to come here. I got Rs 51,000 cash reward for my progressive work and attended international seminars. For the first time in my life,I stayed in an air-conditioned hotel room, said Das,who boarded the train to Howrah on Wednesday,along with eight other farmers from Assam. We stayed in a two-star hotel in Gandhinagar. The facilities were very good,said Shadul Islam,another farmer from Assam.
A group of 28 farmers from Chhattisgarh stayed at a three-star hotel. The state government had engaged both private and GSRTC buses to transport farmers from their respective hotels in Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar. In Shadul and Das,Modi has found new ambassadors. Hum to unme doob  gaye. Bahut  achcha kaam karte hain  (We are quite impressed by him/Modi. He is doing very good work), said Shadul.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Our entire expense,including to-and-fro train tickets,boarding and lodging,and local conveyance were not borne by us. We did not have to spend a single penny. We were told that the Gujarat government was funding our trip, said Ravindra Thakur,a farmer from Semalyachau village near Indore in Madhya Pradesh (MP),who was put up at a newly-built Formula One hotel for the two-day event.
Everything at the two-day summit  and the four-day-long International Exhibition (from September 8) on farming innovation and technologies was taken care of. Buses picked the farmers from their villages,bringing them to the nearest railway stations. At the summit,they had exposure to international experts and companies. There were cash rewards for 543 of them. In the end,they were treated with a trip to Ahmedabad and the Sardar Sarovar Dam site where the Statue of Unity is proposed to be built. Hundreds of farmers,who had put up stalls at Agri Tech Asia exhibition,were given space free of cost and the government also helped them put up multimedia presentations.
Some of us have already left while some of us are being taken to the dam site. Though the river originates in our state,we have never seen the Sardar Sarvovar dam, said V K Sharma,one of the farmers accompanying the delegation of farmers from MP.
The expense was shared by the government,sponsors of the events and seeds companies which are closely working with the government. Sreeram Bioseeds,Monsanto,Mahyco,Nuziveedu Seeds,Western Agri Seeds brought in farmers from Andhra Pradesh,Punjab,West Bengal,Orissa,Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. State PSUs like GNFC and GGRC also brought in farmers,sources said.
A special provision of Rs 15 crore was made in the 2013-2014 budget for the event. For the participating farmers,everything was sponsored, said a top-level officer from the Agriculture Department. All the 2-3 star hotels in Gandhinagar,Ahmedabad and on SG Highway were booked for the three days.
The Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) that was one of the organisers of the event,along with state-run Industrial Extension Bureau (iNDEXTb) and Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation Ltd,identified and invited the speakers for the summit. It also took care of food and refreshments to farmers and other participants during the two-day event. Our role was restricted to bringing farmers to the event. We spent Rs 4,500-5,000 per farmer, said an official of a multinational seed-company (that participated in the summit) on conditions of anonymity.
The farmers who were chosen were progressive farmers who are leaders or are respected figures with considerable following in their villages. This was done purposefully to ensure that the message from the event in Gandhinagar reaches the grassroots, the official added.
Farmers are the footsoldiers taking Modis message to the grassroots.
Modi credits Centre
The state government approached the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) which helped shortlist progressive farmers from each of the 671 districts in India. A special panel,comprising agriculture experts and former central government officials,was set up to choose a farmer from each district for the Rs 51,000 cheque award from this list. Modi gave credit to the Centre in helping to choose progressive farmers at the valedictory function on Tuesday.

Modi said,(To build Statue of Unity),I need the help of farmers. You may think Modi is asking for money but I am asking for emotional attachment,an attachment that will last years.
Sardar Patel was Loh Purush (Iron Man) and we want iron pieces (tools) used by farmers. From 31st October,which is Sardar Jayanti,till 26th January we will go to villages and collect iron blocks.

(File)
The Gujarat High Court (HC) on Friday dismissed a 2019 public interest litigation (PIL), moved by members of civil society, that had sought protection of livelihoods of tribals from five villages of Narmada district near the Statue of Unity at Kevadia colony.
The court observed that this could not be treated as a PIL since the right of possession that was being claimed was an individual right. It would be for the individual to establish that compensation was not paid to them and that they continued to be in possession of the land, the HC noted.
The division bench, headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath, relied largely on an apex court constitutional bench judgment that had interpreted section 24 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (2013) in March this year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The PIL was moved by activists Mahesh Pandya, Anand Mazgaonkar, Ashok Naik and Jatin Sheth in July 2019, on behalf of residents, villagers and tribals from the villages of Kevadia, Vagadia, Navagam, Limdi and Gora. The PIL had contended that while the state government acquired the land parcels in the five villages as long back as 1960, 1961 and 1962, the villagers continued to be in possession of the land and cultivate there. Citing Section 24 (2) of the act, it was submitted that if an acquired land remains unoccupied for five years, the acquisition lapses.
Prima facie, the HC held that every resident of the said villages claiming occupation and possession of the land will have to independently and individually claim any right of compensation that was not paid and the state government not having taken possession of their land all these years.
“Such rights are individual rights attached with each of the present residents who are claiming possession. Thus also, the petition on behalf of such 1,800 persons (295 families) cannot be entertained as a Public Interest Litigation,” observed the caveat judgment, noting third parties cannot act as representatives of such aggrieved individuals.
The HC further noted, “…Such claimants would have to establish and pass both the tests of compensation not being paid to them and also that they are continuing in possession.”
Another point raised in the PIL was that though compensation may have been awarded by the state government, it was not paid to the respective landowners. To this, the division bench noted that the SC Constitution Bench had held that compensation offered and not received by the claimant would amount to compensation being paid.
While dismissing the petition, however, the division bench reserved the rights of the individual residents to claim benefit of Section­ 24 (2) of the Act."

On Tuesday,when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh shared the stage with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi at the inauguration of the renovated national museum on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Shahibaug area,the tension between the two national parties,which these respective leaders represent,was palpable in the air over the issue of claiming the legacy of Sardar Patel. This tension surfaced several times during the course of the function. On one such instance,president of Sardar Patel Memorial Committee,senior Congress leader and Union minister  Dinsha Patel  was acknowledging some of the donors who contributed to the renovation of the memorial. As soon as Dinsha finished his speech,Congress MP from Patan Jagdish Thakor,who was sitting on the front row of the VVIP section of the audience,stood up and asked Dinsha to inform the audience about the contribution of the Narendra Modi-led government towards the museum. Thakor was,in most probability,trying to make a point that the state government did not take any interest in the renovation.
Clash of the Titans
As people started leaving the venue at the end of the inaugural function of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel museum on Thursday,several attendees,mostly Congress workers,were heard making remarks on Modi meeting his match in senior Congress leader and Minister of State for Mines Dinsha Patel. Patel kept prompting him,in a way to correct him,on facts related to a resolution on womens reservation that Sardar Patel got passed in Ahmedabad Municipality. A group of youths were heard cracking jokes on Modi being caught red handed. Apart from winning accolades from Congress workers for his jibe at Modi,Patel also quelled rumours of him joining BJP that sparked a while ago when he met the latter with reference to the Sardar Patel Memorial.
Aiding whathttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Even as Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation kept eluding questions on why Maninagar Assembly Constituency was chosen to build a hostel for working women in Ghodasar ward on the southern outskirts of Ahmedabad,its Standing Committee Chairman Bhupendra Patel said,Tame samji jav ne (Draw your own conclusion). The Centre is contributing 75 per cent of the funds required for setting up of the hostel. In the absence of a convincing reply,the local media seems to have concluded that this is because Maninagar Assembly Constituency is represented by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. The civic body also refuses to make clear if its decision to select the location was preceded by a survey to assess the demand or justifiability.

While BJP party workers and security personnel at the foundation laying ceremony of the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony on Thursday were to ensure that no protesters disrupted the event,protests did seem to take place. Or at least some day. During the course of his speech,as Modi was heaping praises on Sardar Patel for being the tallest leader India has ever seen,some security personnel were seen struggling to push back a rebellious man,masked in white. While sources said claimed he was one of the protesters from Kanda,who was there to voice the concerns of the people of that village who fear the consequences of the Statue of Unity,officials,who managed to push him out of the venue unheard,denied any such connection. An officer on duty at the venue said,He was just a passer-by who wanted to create a scene; he was mentally unstable."

The complaint, filed by the manager of a Vadodara branch of HDFC bank, states that the money was allegedly siphoned off during the period between October 2018 and March 2020.
The Kevadia police station, which has registered the complaint, has started an investigation into the financial transactions of SoU.
The complaint filed late on Monday states that the bank has engaged Writer Business for offering doorstep cash collection facility to the Statue of Unity, which had offline ticket counters before the Covid-19 lockdown for entry to various projects of the tourist spot as well as the regular parking charges.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official of SoU said, “The HDFC bank has been providing services for the cash collected daily by the SoU administration at various counters for offline ticketing and parking fees, and depositing it in the Statue of Unity bank account in its Vadodara branch. The receipt of the cash received is issued to the SoU administration and it is periodically reconciled with the cash deposit entries made in the bank account.”
During the reconciliation carried out with the HDFC after the easing of Covid-19 curbs, the auditors of SoU noticed that the receipts submitted by executives of Writer Business on behalf of the bank did not match with the actual entries into the account.
“An amount of Rs 5.25 crore was missing although the receipts in our record showed that the agent of the HDFC bank had been handed over the amount. The agents provide SoU with a receipt on the letterhead of HDFC. The issue was raised with the bank, which proactively initiated a probe, the official said.”
Narmada District Collector DA Shah, who is also the CEO of the Statue of Unity said that following the discovery of the alleged theft, a committee was formed which included officials of the district administration, HDFC bank, Statue of Unity as well as the agent of HDFC bank.
Shah said, “For collection of cash from the SoU administration and for its deposition in the bank Account, HDFC bank has engaged Writer Safeguard Private Limited. This is purely their internal arrangement and SoU Administration has nothing to do with it. So, HDFC bank is solely responsible for this transaction process. The committee met and scrutinised the records and it was established that the cash was indeed handed over to the bank. So, as per the agreement, the bank has credited the amount to the SoU account by along with the interest, while they will resolve their dispute with their agent on their own.”
Vani Doodhat, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kevadia, said, ” The SoU has provided us with a huge number of daily receipts and transaction slips, which we are examining. We will call in the staff of the agency to question them after identifying the employees who handled the money during the said period.”
“Staff of Writers Business Services Private Ltd.”, mentioned as the accused in the complaint, has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) 407 (criminal breach of trust by carrier), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy)."

(Express: Bhupendra Rana)
On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Statue of Unity to address the annual DGP conference, farmers in nearby villages continued their protest against the land acquisition for the second day Thursday.
Markets in Kevadiya Colony and Garudeshwar remained closed in protest. Black flags, made out of cloth and polythene bags, were also seen hoisted on the roofs of many houses. The protesting tribals said that they would continue their protest till the last day of the conference on Saturday.
The farmers said that their land was first acquired for the Sardar Sarovar dam and now they fear that the remaining land will be acquired for infrastructural projects near the Statue of Unity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrival, police officials were instructed to take down the black flags from the houses visible from the main road. However, many houses inside the village continued to hoist the flags.
“Our only source of income, our lands, were taken while we kept waiting for compensation. They promised us jobs when the statue was under construction. Now, my children are called to the site for work but that is only once a week. We will not accept this. They should first tend to our grievances and then host such extravagant events. We are protesting because we want them to know that we are unhappy,” said Jassiben Tadvi, 52, who hoisted a black flag on her roof on Thursday to protest the arrival of dignitaries, including the Prime Minister, in Kevadiya Colony.
A week before the unveiling of the Statue of Unity in October, in view of the protests, the state government had announced a compensation for the affected villages. The compensation included either Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare of land lost or land at some other location for the lost land.
The villagers, however, refused the package and demanded that their acquired lands be returned. They also reiterated that they will not give up any further land for tourism projects or expansion of infrastructure around the statue, including the state bhavans.
“We don’t want land elsewhere. We want it here where we belong. They will build bhavans and other projects on our land. Why not give it back to us rather than giving us land more than 40-50 kms from here. What use will that land be when our families stay here. We will not give away even an inch of our land any more and we don’t want any monetary packages,” said Sanjay Tadvi, another protesting farmer.
Meanwhile, speaking with The Indian Express, officials of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) said that all further projects, including the state bhavans, will be built on land already acquired by the SSNNL in 1960s and 1970s, when the foundation stone of the dam was laid.
“The SSNNL had acquired land from these villages in 1960s and 1970s for the Sardar Sarovar Dam project and a compensation was also announced back then. But the protests began as many of them wanted equal area of land in compensation for the land being acquired. Recently, a resolution offering ‘land for land’ compensation was issued, which gave an option for monetary compensation. We have also started the process of showing government lands which can be allotted to these people in various places like Chhota Udepur, Dediapada, Narmada, etc. But if still they protest we do not know what to say,” an official from SSNNL said.
Heavy police force was deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incidents. Additional force was deployed near Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s helicopter."

The country’s first seaplane route was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. “Prime minister Narendra Modiji encouraged us a lot to begin this flight and today he not only inaugurated the flight, but he was also our first passenger. This the country’s first scheduled sea plane service that will connect Statue of Unity to Ahmedabad,” Singh told media persons after returning from Kevadiya Colony on the 18 seater aircraft which can accommodate 15 passengers, two pilots and an attendant.
“We will be trying to connect Statue of Unity with other cities. Our first attempt will be to connect Surat. The existing (one-way) fares will be between Rs 1500-5000… It is not like any other common flight. It is a special experience as it would fly at low altitudes from where the surrounding beauty can be seen near Statue of Unity. People who have a habit of uploading pictures of social media will be able to capture very good pictures on this flight,” he added.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to Singh, only 30 percent of the seats will be priced at Rs 1500 under the UDAN scheme. “The rest of the seats will be priced as per the market demand,” he added. Spice Jet began taking bookings on http://www.spiceshuttle.com for the sea plane service between Ahmedabad and Statue of Unity on Friday. “There were too many bookings and so we have now started making a list of people who are interested. We will be intimating them. From tomorrow there will be regular commercial flights… The demand seems to be pretty overwhelming. We have received 3000 requests so far. We had started bookings last night,” Singh said adding the first commercial flight “already happened” on Saturday.
Airline officials said that the airline was still fine tuning the booking system which has already received 3000 bookings, most of which are from the Gujarat region. A message on the spice shuttle website read: “We are experiencing heavy traffic and there is limited inventory on our flights. We will try out best to accommodate your request. Please wait for our confirmation.” The website is currently only taking requests from interest passengers for the four flights on the route.
He said the airline was negotiating for more sea planes which will be taken in lease. “We will add two more planes to this service soon. This is a commercial project, but the interest of the country will also be served, as we will connect tourist spots,” Singh remarked.
The water aerodrome at Sabarmati riverfront is located in a highly populated zone near the Vasna barrage on the river Sabarmati. During the initial flights, the sea plane has been facing issues of birds flying in and around the water body that also has a large slum at the opposite side of the water aerodrome. “Yes, we are forced to take a bigger circle to reach (the Sabarmati waterfront) due to the birds. We are also placing bird diverters,” he added.
On Saturday, the slums at Khodiyar Nagar, which lie bang opposite the water aerodrome at the Sabarmati riverfront were barricaded with white cloth. “These barricades that covers the front portion of our houses were not there till yesterday night. It seems the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) put it up at night,” said Sahil Parmar who had steeped out a hole in the barricade to watch the seaplane land with Prime Minister Modi. “When we objected, the people who were setting up these barricades, told us that it was to stop our children from accidentally entering the riverfront road which will be closed for traffic when Modiji arrives,” said Dinesh Parmar, a resident of the slum. When contacted on the issue, the AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar did not respond.
Apart from beginning seaplane services to Surat, SpiceJet also plans to introduce seaplane services between Port Blair and Havelock in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kaziranga in Assam, Delhi to Naini lake, Haridwar, Rishikesh and Tehri Dam. Similar operations are also planned in Srinagar, Ladakh, Udaipur, Sunderbans in West Bengal and backwaters of Kerala."

(Source: File photo)
Selfies are suddenly back in news. In a tragic accident in Amritsar, a collective of people stood on train tracks, surrounded by the festive fire and the ferocious fireworks of Dussehra, taking selfies, and so involved in this immersive environment of self-gratified feedback loops that they did not see or hear a fast train hurtling at them in the dark. In the aftermath, as video footage and people’s testimonies stitched the gruesome picture together, selfies have emerged as a part of the problem. Apparently, there is something that goes off in our brains, when we see ourselves, glittery, lit, filtered, and modified on the flickering light of our cellphones – in that brief long moment of us watching ourselves, everything else seems to disappear. All that is left is that hungry moment where we consume the self, and the world can literally collapse around us.
These incidents of selfie-love leading to danger and death of the self has been globally reported, and reported often. Each time, over the grief and pain of the families and friend who lament these deaths which looked like just fun and games till they were not, we hear the warning signs that selfies can be dangerous for health. We don’t yet know enough about why we become completely oblivious to everything and everyone around us, in this minute of peak narcissism, when we see ourselves in an image of our own. However, one thing is certain, lately, every time we hear news of public accidents and private tragedies, selfies seem to be implicated.
India leads the way in selfie-related deaths in the world, accounting for 60 per cent of all such deaths around the globe. Selfies are the reason behind fatal accidents on the road as people, whether driving, or walking, seem to lose all sense of self and crash to death. Selfies seem to be lurking in stories of people going on holidays and falling down cliffs, losing themselves in watery depths, or even being mauled by wild animals in their quest for snapping their own images. Selfies seem to be just around the corner in stories of household accidents, street-corner collisions, and even personal fights.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Selfies, like cigarettes, are soon going to come with statutory warnings and images of all the ridiculous ways in which people have harmed themselves in the pursuit of a selfie. I have spent the last two weeks, engaging with the good folks at the online group, Selfie Research Network, and one of the things that has stood out is that selfies are no longer just describing our reality, they are defining it. Selfies used to be a way of capturing some moments of our lives — they now seem to be the only way by which our life can be defined. Selfies are not about our relationship with ourselves — but about our relationship with the world out there, that is no longer accessible but mediated only through the algorithmic platforms of selfie-interaction.
Or to put it other way, we used to think that selfies are the occasional manifestations of our inner narcissus, surfacing in performative moments, to capture an exceptional state of affairs. From there, we have come to a straight-forward internet maxim “pic or it didn’t happen”. We have learned to externalise ourselves, and, in the process, created selfies that stand as a beacon of hope, joy, celebration, attention — superficial, flat, caricatures of life, and trapped in the minutes of their posting, hoping that life will be an endless loop of that endless happiness. Even as we post selfies, we are aware of the hollowness that surrounds them, and desperately hope that if we perform enough happiness, distributing our pearlies on display, maybe things will change. Selfies are now how we live.
And this is not just a personal phenomenon any more. The erection of the Statue of Unity, on a river-island, overlooking an artificial lake, facing the Narmada Dam is a great example of the selfie times we live in. A look at the statue, in its gargantuan stature, smiling benignly for the whole world to look at, and we can now forget the reality that it hides in its concrete steadfastness. It stands on a site that witnessed enormous agitations over people’s rights to their lands. It stands in a state where 25 per cent of its population face hunger and malnutrition, according to International Food Policy Research Institute (Ifpri). It celebrates the man who organised peasants in Gujarat for non-violent civil disobedience, and was inaugurated by a leader whose party has preached and practised communal hatred and violence. It is a selfie of the country that hides the self, and the state of the state where people are struggling to eat, drink, and breathe.

Stating a technical reason, the tribunal said that the case was brought before it more than six months after the construction had commenced and was thus “barred by limitation” of time period. Following the judgment, the petitioners have said that they would now move the Supreme Court.
The NGT stated in its judgment that the application was not filed within six months from the day the work was allotted to M/s Ritwick Construction Pvt.

Limited in 2012. The counsel of the applicants had argued that the limitation in the case was five years and not six months, which was rejected by the Tribunal while citing the provisions of the NGT Act, 2010.
A group of environmental activists had approached the NGT on January 16, 2014, demanding an immediate stay on the ongoing construction of the weir, which will be a part of the larger Statue of Unity project, because no environmental clearance was sought from the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEFC).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The weir is to come up around 12 kilometres downstream of the Narmada dam. It will have a storage capacity of 1 million acre feet of water that will be pumped back to the dam and sent through turbines for production of extra electricity. It will also serve as a tourist attraction as part of the ambitious Statue of Unity project.
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), Gujarat government, MoEFC, Chairman of Environment Sub-Group of Narmada Control Authority (NCA), Union Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment and Ministry of Water Resources were made respondents in the case.
“The applicants have come out with a case that they were alarmed when the construction activity was noticed by them somewhere in September, 2013. They categorically stated in the application. It further appears that around March 2012, it was decided to award the contract to M/s Ritwik Project Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad for an amount of Rs 299.43 crore for Garudeshwar Weir.”
The Tribunal held that the applicant was aware of the fact that the project work was to commence and contract awarded to the private construction company in March 2012, adding that “the date of knowledge regarding the alleged illegal activity, is imaginary and carved out to fit the application within socket of section 14 of the NGT Act, 2010, somehow.”
One of the applicants, Rohit Prajapati said the matter was rejected by the Tribunal only on technical grounds. He said the state reason was that it was not filed within the time limit prescribed by the NGT Act, 2010 but most other contentions of the applicants were accepted.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
”We approached the court only after receiving all the documents, including one from an official of the MoEFC that stated that environmental clearance for the project was not sought. The court has accepted all our major arguments and we have decided to move the SC,” Prajapati said."

Dalit youth leader and independent MLA from Vadgam constituency, Jignesh Mevani, on Tuesday called the proposed The Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Bill “anti-tribal” and burned its copy outside the Assembly complex. The state government is likely to table the Bill in the Gujarat Assembly Wednesday.
“Had I been inside the Assembly, I would have torn this Bill. But since I am not there, I am burning this Bill here and expressing my opposition to it,” he said.
Mevani was expelled from the Assembly for the entire three-day session on Monday for “indiscipline” and “disrespecting” the Chair after he, despite warning from the Speaker, told the treasury benches, “you all believe in Manusmriti (an ancient Hindu religious legal text), not the Constitution”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“On the pretext of Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel, constructed in Kevadiya against wishes of tribals living in the area, the government plans to snatch land and displace tribals from 70 more villages there against provisions of Schedule 5 of the Constitution,” Mevani said and called upon 27 tribal MLAs and 13 Dalit MLAs in the Assembly to join him in opposing the Bill.
He added that the “constitutional rights of tribals are being violated” in Gujarat. He also alleged that the Statue of Unity (SoU) has been built at the site in Kevadiya of Narmada district against the wishes of the tribals and now the government is planning to take away the land of tribals of 70 villages nearby.
The Bill “provides for development of the area and management of tourism in and around the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya by providing necessary infrastructure through effective planning and administration”.
“With ever increasing number of tourists from all over the country and abroad, the state government has felt an imminent need for developing the area,” the government said while explaining the objective of forming a “Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority”.
In reply to a starred question by Congress MLA Chandrika Bariya, the government said that a total 29.38 lakh tourists have visited SoU between November 1, 2018 and November 16, 2019. And this has resulted in the state government earning Rs 82.51 crore, the reply added.
In the past one year, the Gujarat government brought 114 animals from various states and countries to set up a Jungle Safari near the Statue of Unity at the cost of Rs 2.64 crore. Forest Minister provided this information while replying to a question raised by Congress MLA from Dhari constituency, JV Kakadiya."

Two MLAs of Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) — Chhotu Vasava from Jhagadia constituency in Bharuch and his son Mahesh from Dediapada constituency in Narmada — abstained from voting in the Rajya Sabha polls on Friday, thus paving the way for BJP’s victory on three of the four seats as well as Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil’s win on one.
Chhotu, who has been backing the tribal protests in Kevadia against the land acquisition made by the government owned company Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL), said that the party was left with no choice but to abstain from the crucial vote.
Both Chhotu and Mahesh arrived in Gandhinagar on Friday morning but announced that they would abstain from voting unless they get an assurance from the contesting parties — Congress and BJP– about the implementation of Schedule 5 of the Constitution of India and also the Panchayats Extensions to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act to protect tribal rights across the country.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
While veteran Congress leaders were in touch with the BTP leaders to request support in order to forge an outside path for the victory of the party’s second candidate Bharatsinh Solanki, the BJP appointed Bharatsinh Parmar to hold closed doors meeting with the father and son duo to either have them vote for the BJP or abstain. The latter happened.
Chhotu said, “Our demand from both the parties is to implement the Schedule V of the Constitution and also the PESA Act to protect the interests of the tribals but unfortunately, both of them have shown no interest in the issue… My letters to both Narendra Modi from BJP and Sonia Gandhi from Congress regarding tribal rights have been unheeded.”
While Gujarat has implemented the Schedule 5 of the Constitution as well as PESA, the tribal leader says the law is only on paper. “What they (Gujarat government) are doing in Kevadia by snatching away lands from tribals against their will and labelling them as encroachers is against the spirit of the law. They want to exploit tribals for their commercial gains. If they want to make hotels on tribal lands in Kevadia around Statue of Unity, they can do so and make the tribal landholder the owner of the hotel. Why sell the land off to industrial millionaires?” Chhotu said.
The 73-year-old veteran tribal leader is also bitter about the “backstabbing” by the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the Congress fielded a candidate against Chhotu from the Bharuch parliamentary constituency.
“The Lok Sabha wound is still fresh. The Congress did not support me despite knowing that in 2017 Rajya Sabha polls, Congress and Ahmed Patel won the election only because of my vote. This time the stakes were higher for them but they backstabbed me during Lok Sabha instead of backing me to return the 2017 favour.” The Congress had fielded a 34-year-old youth Congress leader to take on sitting BJP MP Mansukh Vasava and Chhotu Vasava in Bharuch in the general polls of 2019.
When asked about the direct benefit the abstinence would bring to the BJP, Vasava said, “I don’t think it would have changed anything. The Congress is in doldrums anyway with just 65 MLAs. Their own people don’t want to vote for them. The BJP was going to win three seats with or without our vote to the Congress. So, our abstinence has not helped the BJP win. It is our way of showing our protest and displeasure at the politics that these two parties play with poor landholders of tribal communities.”
This morning, with 172 MLAs set to vote — until the Vasavas announced abstinence — each of the four candidates needed 35.5votes to win their seats.
The BJP has been in a comfortable position with 103 MLAs and the backing from NCP’s lone MLA Kandhal Jadeja, who had earlier announced his support to the BJP despite the NCP whip for Congress.
The Congress on the other hand with 65 MLAs and one vote from Independent MLA Jignesh Mevani would still only be assured of one seat — of the first preferential candidate Shaktisinh Gohil.
What is Schedule 5 of the Constitution?
The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution pertains to the special powers and provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas as well as of Scheduled Tribes in the states of the country, but excluding Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

A mighty statue of Sardar Patel stands on the edge of the Narmada. So huge is this statue of this Congress leader who is deeply admired by the BJP, that when the Prime Minister inaugurated it and stood for a photo-op beside one of its gigantic feet, he looked like a tiny white speck. Rude comments were made about this by a Congress spokesperson that I shall not repeat. Plans have been announced to build a mighty statue of Ram on the edge of the Saryu river. And, pressure is building from the RSS and Hindu religious sects to begin construction on that temple in Ayodhya before next year’s general election. Plans are also afoot to build a statue of Shivaji on land reclaimed from the sea near Mumbai.
Meanwhile, the chief ministers of our leading Hindutva political party have been busy renaming towns and railway stations that have in them the smallest hint of Islamic rule. Mughalsarai used to be a junction I remember from childhood train journeys because the trains always stopped there late at night and the name had in it such a romantic ring. It saddened me to see this grand old junction renamed after a leader who those who do not belong to the BJP have barely heard of.
Will all these efforts at promoting the causes of Hindutva win Narendra Modi a second term next year? That really is the question we should be asking because that really is what all these exercises are about. Modi has been a polarising Prime Minister from the day he was elected. Now there seems to be an attempt by the BJP’s strategists to use this to his advantage. Will they succeed?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Having spent several days in the past month talking to people in rural Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, I can report that not a single person I talked to — Hindu or Muslim — mentioned Ayodhya, Ram or Sardar Patel. In Rajasthan they talked of the failed rains that have caused a terrible drought in western parts of the state as their main concern. They said they were disappointed with the usual careless manner in which drought relief is being provided. Muslims said they had heard of the killings by vigilantes in Alwar and Ajmer and did not like what they heard. But, their main concern was the grim scarcity of water.
In Madhya Pradesh, I visited villages in which Modi’s government has made strenuous efforts to build pucca homes for those who lived in homes of mud and thatch. I saw some homes that have truly transformed the lives of some of our poorest citizens. They had electricity and gas connections and toilets and in some cases even a certain aesthetic appeal compared to the concrete boxes that were built under earlier housing schemes. The reason why this housing scheme is working well is because money for the houses is being transferred directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. I also saw roads being built where none had existed before. And schools that had real classrooms with desks and chairs and separate toilets for girls and boys.
So will these things win Modi a second term? The answer is complicated. Because although people living in desperate poverty are happy that welfare schemes are working well, what seems to worry them most is the complete absence of new jobs. They said they thought Modi was a good man but did not believe that he had succeeded in bringing the ‘parivartan’ and ‘vikas’ that he had promised. When I asked what exactly they meant by this, everyone said what they needed were jobs. The one issue that crosses the lines between rural and urban India is jobs. And, their absence is being defined as an absence of ‘parivartan’. It has always been my contention that it was economic reasons that got Modi elected Prime Minister with the first full majority in 30 years. Not Hindutva. It will now be economic reasons that could cause him to be defeated, or returned to office with a reduced majority. It was not about Hindutva then and it is not about Hindutva now. But, Modi has been a Prime Minister who has functioned in such total isolation that he could have lost touch with the populist pulse. Lutyens’ Delhi is an evil cocoon but even in that cocoon Modi has built his own little cocoon in which feedback comes only from digital sources and bureaucrats.
There seems to be no other explanation for why in these last months of his first term in office he is encouraging temples and statues instead of finding ways to create new jobs. The Finance Minister made a valiant defence of demonetisation last week, but has anyone told him that the jobs lost because of it have not come back yet? And, no new ones have come."

Reacting sharply to the controversy over the Statue of Unity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that “some saw Sardar Patel as Gujarati, some saw him as belonging to a particular community”, while the project to build the world’s tallest statue was in line with his ideology of respecting all the leaders who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Without naming anyone, the PM said he was not bound to any one family and respected all leaders like Dr B R Ambedkar, Madanlal Dhingra, Abdul Kalam and Mahatma Gandhi equally.
He was hitting out at the Opposition Congress that has been calling the project ‘Made in China’, contrary to the government’s “Make in India” slogan, since the statue’s cladding has been made in China.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Modi’s comment, about people associating Sardar Patel to one community, was aimed at Patidar quota leader Hardik Patel, whose outfit Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) has Sardar Patel as its mascot.
Modi was addressing a gathering in Rajkot, before inaugurating the Mahatma Gandhi Museum at the erstwhile Alfred High School where Gandhi studied.The Rajkot Municipal Corporation undertook the task of converting the school into a museum at a cost of Rs 26 crore. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel and many other BJP leaders were present at the inauguration.
“Every great man inspires future generations. And therefore we are making a memorial of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Why should we make it small? Sardar’s personality is unmatchable. But as a symbol, when we make a statue for him, it should be double the height of any other statue in the world. It was my resolve to build such a statue,” he said.
Without naming Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Modi said: “Those whose minds are obsessed with election, should think why Sardar Patel was made to be forgotten. Instead, people who find fault with everything, people with limited vision, they see election (gimmick) even in his statue. Some started seeing Sardar as Gujarati. Some started seeing him as belonging to a particular community. Sardar is a world personality and we have done him injustice by making him small. It is our responsibility that the world recognises Sardar Patel’s huge avatar and the mammoth task he did for the unity of India.”
People were finding it difficult to accept that they had forgotten Sardar, but now a ‘Chai-wala’ (tea-man) has started reviving him, he added.
He then went on to remind the gathering of how his party had made memorials for other leaders like Ambedkar, Dhingra, Kalam, Gandhi etc.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

“If Sardar Saheb had been the first Prime Minister,things would have been quite different in this country,” Modi said,addressing a gathering at Swaminarayan temple here. Today is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel,the first Home Minister of the country,who hailed from Gujarat. Modi’s followers in BJP often call him “Chhote (Junior) Sardar”.
“Had Patel been the PM,the problems like Kashmir,terrorism,communalism,problems of farmers,would not have cropped up,or would have been dealt with and sorted out,” Modi said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“People still ask what would have been the situation if Sardar Patel was alive today,how would he have reacted to present crisis in the nation. This remembrance by the people is one of the greatest tribute to the iron man of India,” Modi said.
Hailing Patel’s role in unifying the country after independence,Modi said,”Every Gujarati’s heart is filled with pride when he remembers Sardar Saheb.” Modi also talked about his government’s plans to put up Patel’s statue,which would be the tallest statue in the world,to be called ‘statue of unity’,in Narmada district. Referring to decision of Maruti Suzuki India to establish a plant in Mehasana district,he also said that Gujarat was emerging as a auto hub of Asia."

Defined by the BJP as those who have risen from the category of the poor but are yet to stabilise in the middle class, the “neo middle class” figured prominently in Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s maiden Budget speech on Thursday.
Another visible shift was the decision to name various schemes and programmes after RSS ideologues — the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission and Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. The New Teachers Training Programme was named after Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, who used to shuttle between the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha.
Jaitley, who was imprisoned during Emergency, also proposed a Jai Prakash Narayan National Centre for Excellence in Humanities in Madhya Pradesh, thus paying tribute to a leader who spearheaded the mass movement that led to Indira Gandhi’s ouster. An allocation of Rs 200 crore has been set aside for the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The replacement of the “aam aadmi” by the “neo middle class” marks a definite shift in the NDA government’s approach. Even as Jaitley announced a slew of measures targeted at poverty reduction, the acknowledgement of the new aspirational class, a product of the post-liberalisation era, indicated that the politics of freebies, hailed as welfare schemes by the previous governments, may have come to an end.
It was in December 2012 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, first coined this term in the BJP’s manifesto for the Assembly elections. In its 2014 manifesto, the BJP pledged to “meet the aspirations” of this “neo middle class”, saying they need “proactive hand-holding”. They formed a vital part of Modi’s social media strategy to reach out to the youth.
“Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves from the curse of poverty. Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from the difficult challenges have become aspirational. They now want to be a part of the neo middle class,” said Jaitley in his Budget speech.
Announcing the allocation of Rs 7,060 crore for Modi’s vision of 100 smart cities, Jaitley noted that the “neo middle class” has aspirations of better living standards. While setting aside Rs 200 crore for credit enhancement facility for young start-up entrepreneurs belonging to the Scheduled Castes, he again referred to their aspiration “to be a part of the neo middle class”.
While Modi has never given any specific estimates of the numerical strength of this “neo middle class”, the BJP, conscious of the section’s electoral clout, seeks to engage them through policy prescriptions to address their aspirations."

In a setback to the Congress in Gujarat, the Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) of Chhotu Vasava on Wednesday said that it would contest six Lok Sabha seats in the state on its own and ruled out any tie-up with the main opposition party.
At the state level meeting of the BTP, held in Jhagadia in Bharuch district, party’s national president Mahesh Vasava told district unit chiefs that there would be no alliance with the Congress, and asked them to shortlist the candidates.

“We have decided to contest the Lok Sabha polls independently without the support of the Congress. At the meeting, we decided to contest on six seats — Valsad, Bardoli in Surat, Bharuch, Chhota Udepur, Dahod and Sabarkantha. We have also decided to field our candidate from Silvassa in the Union Territory of Daman & Diu. We have told our unit presidents of these districts to come up with a list of probable candidates in the next couple of days. We will decide on the names of the candidates at the party’s working committee meeting which will be held later,” Mahesh Vasava told The Indian Express.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are also planning to field our candidates in some seats in Saurashtra region, Anand and Navsari districts. For that, our leaders are working on it,” he added.

The announcement comes a day after the Congress Working Committee met in Ahmedabad.


	ExplainedWhy the tribal party countsAfter making electoral entry in Rajasthan Assembly with two seats last year, the BTP has been on a strong wicket and in a better bargaining position since its formation post the splitting of the JD(U) in Gujarat. By challenging the Congress, with which it had allied in the 2017 Assembly polls, the BTP, which has a strong hold in the tribal belt of the state, could be looking at a post-poll alliance to stay on the side of power.

The BTP, which has a considerable influence in the tribal belt of south Gujarat, had an electoral alliance with the Congress during the 2017 Assembly polls, and won two of the five Assembly seats which it had contested then.
Sources in the BTP, however, said that the party leaders were miffed with the Congress after they were not invited to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders on Tuesday. “Our leader Mahesh Vasava or his father Chhotu Vasava should have been invited to meet central Congress leadership for seat-sharing talks. But it was not done. This has angered BTP leadership,” said a party source.
Moreover, sources said that Bharuch seat has been the sticky issue for the two parties. While BTP wants to field Chhotu Vasava from Bharuch on its party symbol, the Congress wants him to contest on their symbol.
BTP president Mahesh Vasava, however, said that the decision to not have any alliance with the Congress was taken as it had failed to raise issues concerning tribals at its CWC meeting.
“The reason we are not forging an alliance with the Congress is that at the Adalaj rally of the party, not a single leader raised the issues of the displacement of lakhs of tribals from forest land following the Supreme Court’s order. If they (Congress) don’t take up the issues of tribals at their public meetings, then we are not there to support them. We will not tolerate if they neglect us. Many tribals lost their land in the Statue of Unity project. Congress leaders should have protested, but they were inactive,” Mahesh Vasava said.
In the recently concluded Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, BTS had fielded its candidates in all the three states — four in Madhya Pradesh, five in Chhattisgarh and 11 in Rajasthan — despite having no alliance with the Congress. While the Congress won all the three states, BTP won two Assembly seats in Rajasthan – the tribal dominated seats of Chorasi and Sagwara along the border with Gujarat."

(Representational)
The 64th four-day national conference of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) will be held on Sabarmati Riverfront in the city from December 27 on the theme ‘Bharat Gaurav’. The conference will deliberate and pass resolution over the issue of ‘uban Naxalism’.
Claiming that ‘urban Naxalism’ is widely spreading across educational institutions, the RSS student wing’s national general secretary Ashish Chauhan stated that ABVP is the only student organisation that has taken up the issue and will continue to do so in future as well.
“If you look at the issue of urban Naxalism, ABVP has been the organisation that has emerged as the only one that has been working in campuses, institutions, and society. Even when you talk about incidents, right from the incident of Sheetal Sathe to the issue of its continuous spread within campuses, ABVP has come forward with these issues,” said Chauhan while addressing the media here.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
When asked to elaborate the context under which the issue of urban Naxalism would be discussed, Chauhan told The Indian Express, “It would not be about its awareness among students and in campuses as we believe that students are well aware about its existence on campuses. It would be on ways to deal with the issue and how to stop it from spreading.”


	The rationale behind holding the conventionEven though it has not been able to sweep elections in universities in Gujarat in the way its parent party has at the state level, the ABVP is trying to flex its muscle ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Following the controversies at the Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, and the privately-run Ahmedabad University, ABVP has frequently been seen as a trouble-maker. The last time ABVP held its national convention in Ahmedabad was in 2003, when Gujarat had fewer private universities and existing campuses had elected student bodies.

The ABVP claimed to have coined the word ‘safedposh naxli’ (white-collared naxalites) during its 2017 national convention in Ranchi and passed a resolution against it. “In 2017 national convention, the word ‘safedposh naxli’ (white-collared naxalites) on academic campuses was used and added in the resolution passed after the convention. So this time too, ABVP will do an elaborate discussion on this (urban Naxalism) through deliberations and then resolution will be passed,” added Chauhan.
During recent meeting for the event, the resolution committee also deliberated on issues such as education, women welfare, 100 per cent voting, among others. “In the coming days, after more discussions over these issues and taking suggestions from representatives of national executive, social media, resolutions will be passed in the convention,” as per an ABVP statement.
Recently, the ABVP had cited the reason of ‘urban Naxalism’ for protesting against the appointment of historian and biographer Ramachandra Guha as the Shrenik Lalbhai Chair Professor of Humanities and director of the Gandhi Winter School at Ahmedabad University’s School of Arts and Sciences. The ABVP had submitted a memorandum before university registrar B M Shah, quoting Guha’s writings and terming them anti-national.
Chauhan further stated that 4,000 students and teaching faculty who will participate in the national convention will be taken to the Statue of Unity, which the organisers claimed, have garnered maximum queries and suggestions. “The recently inaugurated Statue of Unity has emerged as a new attraction (for people) on which the organisation has received maximum queries and suggestions. It has been decided to make special arrangements for students’ visit to the statue,” said Chauhan.
Pointing at the logo of the convention that says in Hindi — ABVP 64th Rashtiya Adhiveshan, 27 to 30 December 2018, Karnavati, Gujarat — Chauhan said ABVP very much supports the idea of changing Ahmedabad’s name to Karnavati.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
In April this year, the Central University of Gujarat had issued showcause notices to nine faculty members based on a complaint allegedly by the ABVP that they canvassed for anti-BJP candidates, including Independent MLA Jignesh Mevani and Patidar leader Hardik Patel, during the Assembly elections last year."

Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that the Statue of Unity is a way of rectifying historical wrongs.
Visiting the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat’s Narmada district, Naidu said, “Post-Independence, unfortunately, a distorted narrative of our freedom struggle and the subsequent nation building efforts has been presented in a deliberately distorted manner to the younger generations of our country. The role and contributions of many leaders like Sardar Patel in freedom struggle and later was not presented, giving only partial account of their contributions.”
He added, “This Statue of Unity is a firm reminder of the vision, courage, capabilities and contributions of Sardar Patel to the making of modern India… This historic statue also stands as a reminder for all times to come about the struggle Sardar had undergone in unifying India and the need to uphold the unity and integration of our country.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Naidu said that given the significance of the structure, “the amount spent on erecting it was worth it and it is a priceless investment”.
Known as the “Iron Man of India”, Patel was the country’s first deputy prime minister and home minister. Citing a letter written by Patel to Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister, in which he cautioned about the threat that China posed, Naidu said, “We all know that one of our neighbours waged war against us in 1962 and its result. Had Sardar’s concerns been taken seriously, the situation could have been different. All other issues raised by Sardar Patel still remain relevant.”"

Police rushed to Kevadiya Colony on Monday after angry tribals locked the office of executive engineer of Sardar Sarovar Punarvasvat Agency to protest against lack of jobs for local villagers at the Statue of Unity site. They also complained of lack of facilities for those displaced by the project.
“We immediately reached the sport after getting information that tribals had locked the executive engineer. The situation was brought under control quickly after we dispersed the crowd,” said Ajay Damor, Inspector at Kevadiya Colony. No one was detained and now FIR has been lodged.

	Explained Why tribals oppose land acquisitionThe tribal belt around the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Narmada district has been in a ferment since the inauguration of Statue of Unity on October 31 — stemming from the central issue of loss of land, compensation, jobs and access to water from Narmada Canal. The government’s attempt to pacify villagers by hiring them as guides at statue site has not proved productive. Despite several measures announced by the government, the tribal agitations is showing no sign of waning. The tribals’ opposition to land acquisition stems from their past experience when people from 19 villages were displaced by the Narmada dam project. According to the Centre, 4,763 project affected families in Gujarat were rehabilitated, while the construction of the dam had left over 32,000 families affected in the three states of Gujarat, MP and Maharashtra. However, large number of tribals believe that rehabilitation was done in a shoddy manner.

Notably, the incident took place two days ahead of a planned protest march by tribal outfits against acquisition of land by the government. On Wednesday, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the Statue of Unity to preside over the two-day annual DGP conference, tribals are set to march from Kevadiya Colony — the site of the Statue of Unity and Sardar Sarovar Dam — to the Collector’s office in Rajpipla.
Over 1,000 people, under the banner, ‘Zameen Bachao, Adivasi Bachao andolan’ (Save Land, Save Tribals Movement), are expected to take part in the march. The main demand of the movement is to stop any further land acquisition in view of new projects like government buildings, state guest houses and railway station being planned to be built in and around the Statue of Unity.
“Our demands still remain intact. Our fight is against the rampant development that has been taking place in this area at the cost of the nature. For us, our land is most important, that is our source of income. And our lands are being acquired for projects that have no direct benefit for us. After repeatedly protesting and seeking jobs a few people were hired, but on temporary basis, either as cleaners or to sell bottles. But the contract ends within six months. So, what after that,” asked tribal leader Praful Vasava, who lives in Rajpipla. In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Vasava had contested from Chhota Udepur seat on a JD(U) ticket and lost. At present, he is not associated with any political party, and heads a social outfit called the ‘Indigenous Army of India’.
Apart from villagers around the site, including Navagaam, Waghadia and Mukhudi, people from across Narmada district are expected to join the march. The villagers have been demanding an undertaking from the government promising not to acquire any more land from the tribal belt for developmental projects. They have also been demanding that local tribals should be recruited at the Statue of Unity site and they should be trained in skill development. They had been also demanding that water from the Narmada Dam for irrigation should be first provided to local farmers.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Discounting the recent sops offered by the state government for the tribals, including conversion of 196 forest villages to revenue villages, as “election gimmick”, Vasava said, “Promises are made every time just ahead of the elections. After elections we will still be on the suffering end. We want them to stop exploiting our land any further,” he added."

Addressing an election meeting organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Swaminarayan Chowk in Rajkot, Irani claimed that had Patel been given the opportunity to lead the country, Article 370 would not have been there in the Indian Constitution and that the country would have progressed more. Patel was the man who united the country under one flag and dedicated his entire life to the nation, she said.
“When a statue dedicated to him was proposed, Gujarat was surprised as the Gandhi family raised protest and the Congress asked why waste money. They did not have problem when airports were named after the family. They had no objection when a college constructed at the taxpayers’ cost was named after the family…,” said Irani, Union Minister for Textiles, and Women and Child Development.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Irani said that Congress kept on objecting to the SoU even when not only Gujarat but India in general had responded to Modi’s call for building the grant statue downstream the Narmada dam. She said that while it was in power at the Centre, Congress left no stone unturned to “try and stop development of Gujarat”.

(file)
With the fresh list of candidates announced by the BJP for Gujarat, Bharuch Parliamentary Constituency is turning out to be a keen contest, with tribal heavyweight and Jhagadia MLA Chhotu Vasava all set to contest on the symbol of the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP), a party floated by his son Mahesh ahead of the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls. Chhotu’s plunge into the fray has ensured that the BJP refrains from disturbing its four-time winner MP Mansukh Vasava, despite his “rebellion” ever since he was made MoS for tribal development in 2016.
The BTP is in the middle of a hectic bargain for an alliance, with Congress. Sources say the Congress is keen that Chhotu contest Bharuch on its party symbol. This is not acceptable to the tribal leader, who has also announced his decision to field BTP candidates from six other seats in Gujarat. The Congress says it would not be feasible to let go of all the tribal seats to accommodate the BTP. Gujarat has four parliamentary seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes, and Bharuch is not among them. However, Bharuch has always voted for tribal leaders.
The Congress has meanwhole already announced the candidature of MLA Mohansinh Rathwa’s son Ranjitsinh from the Chhota Udepur parliamentary constituency.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
For Chhotu Vasava, however, how Congress responds to his demands will be a test of its ‘gratitude’ to him, a former JD(U) leader for having voted in favour of Congress leader Ahmed Patel during the high stakes 2017 Rajya Sabha polls. “There is no question of my candidature on any other party symbol except the BTP. It should not matter to them (Congress) so long as we are in an honest alliance,” he said. “Even when I was with JD(U), I voted for Congress’ Ahmed bhai Patel (during the Rajya Sabha polls). It is time for them to repay the debt they owe me.” Meanwhile, Ahmed Patel’s son Faisal Patel said on Twitter that he would not be contesting from Bharuch.
Chhotu Vasava says he is aware that Bharuch has been a BJP stronghold since 1989, and victory has eluded him four times, including a bypoll in 1996 when he lost by a margin of 11,000 votes. However, he expressed the hope that the tribal people would vote for change. “Times have changed but the lives of tribals haven’t,” he said. “They (tribal people) have been taken for a ride, and with the exposure to facts they are also aware about it now. It is time for them to make a change to improve their own conditions.”
Chhotu, who along with son Mahesh, is all set to campaign across the tribal belt of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, held anti-government rallies across the Narmada and Bharuch over the past two months, mainly targeting the government over its land acquisition policies. “The Statue of Unity is a big scam to fool tribals into giving away land for commercial private use,” he said. “The tribals were the owners of these very lands. Now, the government has taken away our ownership and is enticing us to become labourers to someone else in the name of employment.”
He said there was also a “conspiracy to dislodge tribal communities from their homes in forest areas”.
BTP Convenor and Spokes-person Ambalal Jadav says that with Chhotu in the race and a tie-up with the Congress party in the pipeline, the alliance will have a good chance of thwarting the BJP. “So far, the problem has been the 21% vote share comprising of Patels and Rajputs,” he said. “The Congress has minority votes on its side and tribals vote in fair numbers for parties other than the BJP too, but so far the other communities haven’t taken to the Congress.” He explained: “This time, there are four Assembly Constituencies, namely Jhagadia, Karjan, Jambusar and Dediapada that are with Congress-BTP combine. It will make a lot of difference this time. However if the Congress BTP alliance does not work out, the BJP will certainly win again.”
In fact, the Congress had fielded a candidate, Jayesh Patel, from the Patel community in 2014 but lost the seat by about 1.5 lakh votes. It has however been a feature of Bharuch constituency that despite being a general seat, it has elected ST candidates since 1989.
Sources in the Congress party say that Bharuch is not the actual bone of contention. Talks about alliance have not fructified due to Chhotu Vasava’s “ambitious” demands. “Chhotu Vasava is demanding a tie-up for seven seats, which is impossible,” a Congress leader, who did not want to be identified, said. “We are most willing to field Chhotu in Bharuch and give him a free hand. This is also because Congress lacks a tribal face that can match up to Mansukh Vasava, who has won the seat four times…But the alliance can materialise only if Chhotu becomes a bit practical.”
The leader said that Ahmed Patel is in talks with Chhotu to finalise the alliance. The party has its list of candidates for the seat too, including Chhotu’s right-hand man Anil Bhagat, who contested the 2017 Assembly polls from Ankleshwar and lost.
Sources within the BJP say that the party is aware that a direct alliance between the Congress and BTP could make the contest an extremely close one. A BJP leader admitted that like the Congress, the BJP too has an issue with fielding a person who can match of the popularity of Chhotu and Mansukh. “In a way, Bharuch has been a BJP seat since 1989 and it should be called a safe seat, but we know we cannot use that term here because it can sway any which way depending on the alliances,” the BJP leader who requested anonymity said."

Around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity in Kevadiya, Gujarat, on Wednesday morning, in Borivali, nearly 400 km away, 28-year-old Harshal Chheda was picking up the day’s newspapers that had full-length advertisements on the front pages celebrating the opening of the world’s tallest statue.
By afternoon, Chheda had stuck two stamps each depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the front pages and he headed to the General Post Office in south Mumbai to get the papers emblazoned with a black cancellation stamp that would set the seal on a valuable addition to

his collection.
Professional stamp collectors started streaming in to the Philately room at the GPO Wednesday morning with uniquely crafted tributes to the leader credited with piecing together the Union of India.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Shailesh Kadam, a marketing executive in the Philately section, said at least 20 collectors from all over Mumbai and Thane and also from Pune, Nagpur and Bengaluru had poured in. “The round cancellation stamp adds value to the collection and signifies it is as a collector’s item. It increases the value of an item during exhibitions,” he said.
As the day progressed, veterans showed off their creations and gaped at Chheda’s stack of papers. “I’ve got newspapers in seven different languages and I stuck a regularly available Vallabhbhai Patel stamp and a commemorative one issued on October 31, 2016, to mark his 141st birth anniversary,” he said. That stamp also features an image of the statue, whose construction was in progress then.
As philatelists are required to go the extra mile to make each piece stand out, the pride of Chheda’s collection was an advertisement that L&T, the firm that constructed the statue, had placed in a leading financial daily. The second-generation stock broker had pasted a limited edition stamp issued in 2008 commemorating Henning Holck-Larsen, the Danish co-founder of the engineering firm, on top of it.
Considerably younger than his fellow philatelists who reached the GPO on Wednesday, Chheda, who began collecting stamps in his teens, taking after his father Hasmukh, can be counted as a veteran with an enviable collection.
Other philatelists, like Thane resident Nilesh Gala, came to the GPO with a less bulky collection. His work included A4 sheets filled with a short bio of the country’s first home minister, along with an image of the statue, two stamps and a flattened ICON matchbox. The brand, which is manufactured in Sattur, Tamil Nadu, also features a reproduction of the statue and the words “Statue of Unity”.
“I doubt anyone else in the world has a collection like this,” beamed the 48-year-old who works with a weigh bridge manufacturer. Although it took two months of searching and persuasion before Gala could acquire the matchbox cover, he said the work is not yet complete. “I am looking for a Rs 10 note that includes today’s date in the serial number. But it won’t be easy to find one. Every collector in the country will be looking for such a note,” he said.
Gala’s collaborator, who is also a rival collector, Jigar Desai, brought in the same A4 sheets and similarly designed envelopes. “I was looking for the ICON matchbox also. But lost out on it. But if I can find it, I’ll put together an A4 sheet for Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary next year and hope to get it autographed by Modi. If I can manage that, I will never part with it,” he said.

In spite of having Amitabh Bachchan’s signature and concocting a curious combination of stamps, pictures and matchbox covers to mark birthdays of actors Shahrukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Raveena Tandon among others, Desai insists that Wednesday’s cancellation stamp holds a special place for him. “India has built the world’s tallest statue. For a philatelist, this is a mix of history and a world record,” he said."

Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Shipping, Chemicals and Fertilizers, on Saturday said that foreigners who come to India now visit Akshardham and the Statue of Unity instead of Taj Mahal and Sidi Saiyyed’s mosque.
“Earlier when people used to come to Delhi, they were shown the Taj Mahal. Hindustan did not recognise its own strength. We ourselves never recognised it… When the foreigners come to India now they first to go see Akshardham. They do not go to see the Taj Mahal,” said the minister.

The Union minister also compared Modi’s mass popularity with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, “whose lives became a message” for the nation. “Whatever Modiji says the nation does. Why does Modiji take up a subject and the nation works on it? It is because of his commitment towards the nation,” Mandaviya said."

In May this year, several months before he began his Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat, Congress president Rahul Gandhi held a public meeting in Dediapada, a tribal-dominated Assembly constituency, in Narmada district. Before addressing tribals who had gathered in large numbers to hear him, Rahul paid a visit to Goddess Panduri temple in Dev Mogra, about 25 km from Dediapada, where in the visitor’s book he wrote, “Thank you for a wonderful visit. I look forward to coming back here soon. May Yahamogi Panduri Mataji bless Gujarat and all of us to bring happiness and prosperity to the state.” Sources in the temple said that the head priest of the temple blessed Rahul and prayed for him to become “the Prime Minister in 2019.”
On Monday, Congress workers in Dediapada broke into celebrations after Bhartiya Tribal Party president Mahesh Vasava won by a margin of 21,700 votes against sitting MLA Motisinh Vasava. The Congress had entered into a pre-poll alliance with the BTP, which initially had irked the party’s local cadre. But in the end, they got together to campaign against the BJP in the end.

“Initially, there was resentment as the party cadre had worked very hard for the seat. So, they also wrote to the central Congress leaders to reconsider the decision to share the seat with the BTP. But as the election approached and due to intervention by senior leaders, the local unit campaigned for Vasava,” a Congress leader said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

It was not only in Dediapada, but also in Nandod Assembly segment in the district where the BJP suffered a big upset, losing its hold in the tribal district completely. The BJP’s high-pitched appeal that the Statue of Unity — Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project of erecting the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — would change the fortunes of the tribals here brought no dividends. The BJP’s defeat in Nandod has put the party’s leaders in an embarrassing spot.
Sitting MLA and State Minister for Forest and Tribal Development Shabdasharan Tadvi lost to Congress’s Premsinh Vasava. Tadvi, who contested for the first time in 2012, had the advantage of the constituency with a substantial Tadvi population following the delimitation. However the poll results indicate that even in the 14 polling booths surrounding the Statue of Unity, the Congress won by a margin of 5,157 votes.
The BJP’s wipeout from Narmada district, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived on September 17 to inaugurate the Narmada Dam after the work of installation of 30 flood gates was complete, has certainly come as a jolt to the BJP.
“It has certainly come as a bolt from the blue. Losing Narmada was not part of our calculations, although we knew that many factors would lower the tally in the state. We were aiming for 150 and Narmada was a crucial factor. However, this defeat does not mean that the idea of Statue of Unity has been rejected by the people. In fact, the BJP has consolidated its position in Dabhoi and other seats in Vadodara district as well as Bharuch —all places that will directly benefit from the tourism that Statue of Unity will bring,” a senior BJP leader said.
Many BJP leaders, however, said that resentment among the tribals against the government for recognising many communities that are not native tribals as Scheduled Tribes has cost the party dearly in Narmada.
In September, BJP MP from Bharuch Mansukh Vasava had sent a letter to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes urging that certain communities from North Gujarat, identified by the Gujarat government as Scheduled Tribes, must be immediately “dropped”. The letter was aimed at communities such as the Bharwads, Rabaris and Siddi Muslim. During poll campaign, Vasava used to speak about “real tribals” of Gujarat being “kept away from employment opportunities by groups with vested interests, who have included other communities as tribals”."

(Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)
Kevadia, home to Gujarat’s largest dam named after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, on the Narmada river, was a sleepy village till the construction of the 182-metre Statue of Unity (SoU) began in 2014. Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the statue in October 2018, and more than 29 lakh tourists visited the site within a year.
However, now Kevadia is among the six villages protesting against the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) a Gujarat government-owned public limited company incorporated in March 1989 to execute and manage the Sardar Sarovar project. The SSNNL that executed the Rs 3,000-crore SoU project now needs the land for ancillary tourism infrastructure projects.
On June 2, Natwar Tadvi, a 65-year-old farmer of Kevadia was stopped from immolating himself to save his 16-acre land acquired in 1961, and fenced by the SSNNL in May this year after the Gujarat High Court dismissed a PIL filed by affected families of six villages protesting the acquisition and “meagre” compensation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The villagers say that the land was originally acquired for the Narmada dam but was left unutilised as the location of the dam changed. The original intent of acquisition doesn’t exist anymore and so the landholders should be allowed to continue living there and SSNNL’s claim on the land be invalidated.
On June 15, Dinesh Tadvi of Gora village and his tractor driver Chetan Tadvi were booked for trespassing when they tried ploughing the land now occupied by SSNNL. Now there are five teams for surveillance of the villages — Kevadia, Vaghadia, Limdi, Gora, Navagam and Kothi — where warning of prosecution have also come up.
General Manager (Technical & Co-ordination) of SSNNL, MB Joshi, said that as per the Narmada Waters Dispute Tribunal (NWDT) Award of 1979, the six villages had 238 landholders, of which about 105 original landholders are yet to agree upon the compensation package. “There were 241 major sons of the original landholders counted as beneficiaries. Of these, about 120 second generations of original landholders are yet to accept the compensation,” he says.
Natwar, who worked as a mason for SSNNL’s construction projects, says, “They (government) took away nearly five acres of my cultivable land for a railway project almost two years ago. Till date, they have not given me a single penny or land as compensation as I don’t have the ancillary property documents. Our family land of 16 acres was fenced for acquisition in 1961. We are a family of 60, surviving on the produce from the land. How will I feed the family without land?”
Natwar who lost all his land says the current market value is about Rs 35 lakh per hectare, against which SSNNL is offering Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare (2.4 acres), which is not enough to buy the equivalent of what he lost.
Joshi, said, “A significant time has passed and the younger generation may not even know facts of the compensation awarded to their forefathers. Moreover, we cannot consider the third or fourth generations of the landholders as beneficiaries… They are being misguided by people with political interests.”
In its reply to the High Court, the SSNNL said that the government completed physical possession of 1814.65 acres of land in five villages and paid compensation. But since the lands were not utilised, the villagers returned to their lands and subsequently the original landholders died.
As per the guidelines of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA), male heirs of a landholder displaced due to the project, who are 18 years of age as of November 1 1989, were to be given land measuring two hectares or the original size of their land — whichever is bigger — as well as a 250 square feet plot for animal husbandry. The villagers have the option to choose monetary cash compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh per hectare of land acquired.
Villagers like Bhangi Tadvi whose house stands between two plots of fenced land fears eviction as his house might be an “eyesore”.
Political opponents of the BJP-run state government –the Congress and the Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) — have backed the protesting villagers. BTP supremo and tribal MLA from Jhagadia, Chhotu Vasava, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the land acquisition be stopped.
Vasava, who calls it the “Statue of Displacement”, told The Indian Express, “The land was acquired in 1961-62 from tribals for the construction of the Narmada Dam but the location of the dam was changed and the government wants to sell the land to millionaire businessmen for building a hotel industry… Across the country, they are using their power to leave tribals landless and sell land to their industrialist friends. There should be a judicial inquiry into the police violence and torture on the tribal families.”
As many as 250 original landholders and their heirs are yet to accept the compensation offered by the SSNNL.
Joshi says, “We are willing to hear their suggestions and also include those on the list of beneficiaries where we are not able to draw up a proof of the compensation paid earlier from our records.”
SSNNL has proposed resettlement of 1,000 families to an ‘Adarsh Vasahat’ project, to be constructed on 16 hectares of land belonging to SSNNL in Gora village. It has also offered to allot shops in a shopping complex to be built in the SoU parking area for those whose shops were razed during acquisition. SSNNL officials say this would include even those affected families who were not part of the original list of beneficiaries."

The statue of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, to come up in the Arabian Sea, will be the tallest in the world, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said in the state Assembly. The height of the statue along with the pedestal will be 210 metres. The height of the statue will be 121.2 metres and it will be mounted on a pedestal 88.8 metres tall. His statement followed Congress-NCP allegations that the government had reduced the height of the statue.
Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan (Congress) said, “When the original proposal of Shivaji statue was mooted during the Congress-NCP regime, the height proposed was 160 metres and pedestal was 32 metres. The height of the statue along with pedestal, which was discussed and approved, was 192 metres.” Giving reasons for altering the height, the Chief Minister said, “The expert committee that mooted the proposal for structural design has recommended 60:40 ratio for the height of Shivaji statue and pedestal. The government had approved the design recommended by the panel of experts including the JJ School of Arts and Architecture.”
Chavan said, “The Fadnavis government altered the design where it reduced the height of the statue from 160 metres to 121.2 metres. And instead it raised the pedestal height from 32 metres to 88.8 metres.” Although overall height of the project increased from 192 metres to 210 metres, the actual height of the statue has been reduced, he said. Chavan said, “After the design change, the state government has not received environmental clearance from the Environment Appraisal Committee, which is mandatory.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Indicating that he was raising the basic questions to know whether the design change was to save on expenditure, Chavan said, “The technical reason cited by the state government was not convincing.” Drawing a parallel with the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, showing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Congress leader pointed out that the statue was 157 metres tall and the pedestal was only 25 metres taking the total to 182 metres.
The government dismissed Chavan’s comparison as technically faulty. “There is a difference between statue in the river and in the deep sea,” Fadnavis said, adding, “In the last 15 years, Congress-NCP government could not install a single brick for the Shivaji memorial project. During their tenure they could not even get the approval from the ministry of environment.”
Last week, the government handed over the letter of acceptance to L&T for the project. The project would cost Rs 2,500 crore. Apart from the tallest statue of Shivaji mounted on a horse, there would be a state-of-the-art auditorium where a light and sound show would depic the life and work of Shivaji."

Union Minister for Shipping Mansukh Mandviya has directed the Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) and Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to jointly start seaplane operations on the Sabarmati River and Statue of Unity route by October 2020, a government release stated on Tuesday. As many as 16 seaplane routes could be functional in due course of time, the release said.
Mandviya who held a meeting with the officials of SDCL, IWAI, Ministry of Shipping as well as aviation officials, said in the release, “The seaplane project will provide a fast and convenient travel option for remote and mountainous regions. Sixteen seaplane routes have been identified under regional connectivity routes. The Sabarmati and Sardar Sarovar-Statue of Unity routes have been included in this 16 seaplane route and the hydrographic survey of this route has been completed.”
The Batherymetric and Hydrographic survey will be conducted by IWAI on behalf of the Airports Authority of India by September 2020 for all routes. Mandviya said that the Sabarmati and Narmada Valley-Statue of Unity seaplane route will save time and boost tourism as it will provide an opportunity for an overview of the Narmada Valley and the Statue of Unity.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Mandvia has also entrusted officers to prepare a model for the water aerodrome terminal that will be constructed, after conducting a thorough research of terminals across the world where seaplanes are operational.
In September 2019, the District Collector of Narmada issued orders to restrict traffic movement within the premises of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam, temporarily closing the exit road along the three natural ponds that also served as a scenic drive for tourists. The administration has begun the work of isolating pond 3, also known as Dyke 3, which was chosen as the location for seaplane terminal in July 2018. Officials are working on keeping crocodiles at bay before the work of building the terminal starts.
The rock-filled pond is officially named Panchmuli Lake and popularly called the ‘Magar Talav’ as it is infested with crocodiles. The site was finalised for terminal as its dimensions suit the requirements of landing the seaplane, which requires a minimum width of 900 metres in a water body with a depth of at least six feet. This is not the first time that Panchmuli lake has been chosen for tourist activity. The lake was a boating spot until 2013 when a stranded boat with about 60 tourists was surrounded by crocodiles, causing much panic among authorities."

(Representational Image)
NITI Aayog member Vinod Paul on Saturday suggested that the health sector shift priorities to non-communicable diseases, palliative care and mental health, “not simply areas which we have delivered in a significant way.”
Paul was speaking at the 6th National Summit of Health in Gandhinagar on Saturday.
Hailing the primary healthcare set-up in the country, Paul said, “We are just beginning the second phase of transformation of our primary healthcare…We delivered well in maternal and child healthcare and communicable diseases.We have started screening of diabetes…screening is just the beginning… (we need innovation on) how can we have insulin delivery? We have to ultimately achieve reduction in non-communicable diseases-related premature mortality.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Paul also said that innovation was required in the “care of the elderly” and “mental health”.
Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who holds the health portfolio in the state, batted for unity in spending on healthcare irrespective of the political regime. “Our country has limited resources so we have to utilise it very efficiently…and tactfully focus on specific areas with due consideration” He also suggested emulating the best practices of other states. “In a country this wide, every state has its own problem areas…Success models of other states can be replicated,” he said.
Vinod Paul too spoke of utilisation of funds. Stressing how “money unspent is an opportunity lost,” he suggested ways to optimise value for money. “Efficient use of budget (is one way)…. How can we achieve that through engineering…system-level transformation and innovation… (it is) an interesting area to look at,” he said
Paul also touched upon managerial efficiency. “How can we improve the working of our district and sub-district hospitals and take them to the level of managerial efficiency and performance with the very best private (hospitals)…. Night surgeries, infection control, patient safety (are some areas of improvement)…,” he said.
Another area ripe for innovation was urban healthcare. “It (a city) is a finite geographical area. Communication and access is easier and yet I think we have a long way forward in terms of optimum urban healthcare.”
Deputy Chief Minister Patel in his address said innovation, technology and infrastructure is futile until trained staff is in place.
The Statue of Unity was frequently mentioned at the event. Deputy CM said a trip has been planned for delegates to the Statue of Unity after the three-day conference, while Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in his opening remarks said, “Gujarat has given the world our ‘rashtrapita’ Mahatma Gandhi and iron man Sardar Patel. It was my wish that this conference be held at the Statue of Unity but we were not fortunate enough..But we will try (to do so) in the times ahead…”
The 6th National Summit, on Good and Replicable Practice and Innovations in Public Healthcare System in India’, was held under the aegis of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and was inaugurated by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The report red-flags not just international NGOs like Greenpeace but select ones from Gujarat that have campaigned against the government: “A consortium of NGOs like Maldhari (herdsmen) Rural Action Group (MARAG), People’s Union for Civil Liberties, Movement for Secular Democracy, Gujarat Sarvodaya Mandal, etc are making efforts to debunk the Gujarat model of development.”
The report claims that these NGOs actively participated in a seminar on March 15 organised by one Gujarat Vikas Manch Lokadhikar Aandolan. At this seminar, the report says, “leaders (of the NGOs) criticised the (Gujarat) state government on issues of Statue of Unity, Special Investment Regions (SIRs), Mithi Virdi (Bhavnagar) nuclear power project, industrial development, employment, health, agriculture etc issues.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The 21-page secret report to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) names several foreign-funded NGOs and alleges that these were “stalling development projects”.
It identifies their future targets: campaign against palm oil imports from Indonesia, disposal of e-waste of Indian IT firms, organising construction workers in urban areas, protests against identified projects such as Gujarat’s SIRs, Par Tapi Narmada River Interlinking Project and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor.
The report says that MARAG director Laljibhai Desai, also president of Azad Vikas Sangathan, was instigating, managing and leading agitations against SIRs of Dholera and Mandal-Bechraji.
Desai, who joined Congress before the Lok Sabha elections and is its general secretary in Gujarat, said: “There is no question of any NGO steering the campaign against the government.This government has come to power through corporates and so they will safeguard their interests by targeting voluntary groups who support the people’s cause.”
Before initiating the public agitation against MB-SIR, Desai resigned from MARAG and handed it to his wife, Neeta Pandya. Desai’s protests ultimately forced Gujarat government to exclude 36 out of the 44 villages earmarked for the project.
The IB report says that MARAG received Rs 5.53 crore during 2006-12 with majority coming from Save The Children. Other fund providers were Bioversity, Child Relief & You, International Fund of Agricultural Development, Oxfam and Canada India Village Aid.
The report also names Movement for Secular Democracy, a voluntary organization based in Ahmedabad, which has been active in various cases being contested by victims of the 2002 riots.
MSD’s Convener and veteran Gandhian Prakash N Shah said that criticizing a policy of the establishment on grounds of principle was “not an act of treason”.
PUCL, another one of the organizations which played an active role in campaigning for 2002 riot victims and testified before the Gujarat Government-appointed MB Shah Commission that was probing into corruption allegations against the then Modi Government, has criticised the IB report.
Says its Gujarat general secretary Gautam Thaker: “We don’t get any foreign funds whatsoever. And if some organization is taking foreign funding, what’s the problem if they do it under the provisions of the law of the land? (Going after critical NGOs) would be an undeclared emergency and people need to wake up.”
The IB report marks out another Gujarat-linked project being under NGO attack, the Par Tapi Narmada River Interlinking Project with protests led by Parthi Purna Adivasi Sangathan (PPAS) against the construction of six dams in Gujarat and one in Maharashtra to move water from surplus Western Ghats to north Gujarat and Saurashtra/Kutch.
PPAS alleges 24 villages will be submerged and 51 will be partially affected, has mobilized tribal residents and managed to halt survey work being carried out by the National Water Development Authority.
“The government was initially not being vocal about the project fearing protest. We learnt about it only through the RTI, and now tribal leaders and residents are trying to halt it,” said Sujata Shah, who is working with the NGO.
She is also a member of Sarvodaya Parivar Trust, another NGO opposing the project. “Our primary support comes from donors most of whom are from India. We have over 1,200 donors, who offer small donations.”"

Vasava has urged the parliament to pass a majority decision to “revoke” the notification that has become a cause of a major uproar in the district.
Read |Gujarat: BJP tribal leader Mansukh Vasava resigns from party
This comes a over a month after the MP from Bharuch constituency had resigned from the party and then withdrawn the same the next day.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In his letter dated January 25, addressed to the Secretary General of the Lok Sabha, Vasava sought permission to “discuss” the issue of the classification of 121 villages of Narmada district into the eco-sensitive zone, as per the May 2016 notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), which is being implemented on ground since November last year.
In his letter, Vasava stated: “Countless tribal people reside in Narmada district, which falls under my parliamentary constituency of Bharuch. These people are dependent on the forest produce and animal husbandry for their livelihood. As per a notification of the Government of India, 121 villages of Narmada district have been included under the eco-sensitive zone. By way of this notification, government officials have begun intervening in matters related to the lands that are under the rightful ownership of the original villagers. It has given rise to apprehensions that the interference of the state government would be detrimental to the financial progress of the tribal communities as well as their social growth and livelihood. This marginalised community expects that the government will think of their development without tampering with their lands and forests. With the Statue of Unity and the adjoining area speedily turning into a commercial hub, there is urgent need to release these villages from the eco-sensitive zone notification. It is my request that for the peace and progress of the tribal-dominated district of Narmada, the notification classifying the villages as ‘eco-sensitive zone’ should be immediately revoked. I urge you to undertake a majority decision in this favour.”
Matters, which are not points of order or which cannot be raised under the rules relating to Questions, Short Notice Questions, Calling Attention, Motions in the Lok Sabha, can be raised under Rule 377. Notice for raising a matter under rule 377 is to be given in writing, addressed to the Secretary General specifying clearly and precisely the text of the matter to be raised.

Soon after Vasava had submitted his resignation to the party, the Gujarat government had withdrawn the revenue record entry highlighting the lands of 14 of the 121 villages as “eco-sensitive zone”, citing it as administrative error.
Following the resolution made by the government to “withdraw” the revenue record entry marking lands as ‘ESZ’ on the physical record, the respective revenue offices of the talukas now “physically verifying” the status of the lands on case-to-case basis, should any application be made by locals for any activity on the said lands. The villages continue to be under the eco-sensitive zone for all other purposes of administration and rules."

“It is very important to learn yoga and understand its significance in maintaining a healthy body and mind. I am going to ask all the state officers to take out time on every Sunday for yoga. They can contribute promoting yoga by learning it at their nearest public garden and community centre,” said Chief Minister Anandi Patel while congratulating the participants at GMDC ground on the International Yoga Day.

Amid the resonating sound of the Sanskrit shlokas at the Sama indoor sports complex, a group of Congress workers protested the use of the venue for “government functions only”. The Congress leaders demanded that the public sports complex, which was inaugurated by CM Anandi Patel last July, should be thrown open to people. Jitendra Solanki and Dev Patel who led the protest said, “The sports complex was constructed from the taxpayers money in order to benefit citizens, but for over a year, the guards do not let people enter inside as the sports complex is used only by students of schools who are benefactors of the ruling party. This is unfair,” Patel said. The group was detained by the local police to end the ruckus.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to kickstart his engagements on his birthday, falling on Sunday (September 17), by visiting his mother in Gandhinagar and receiving her blessings in the morning.
Similar to his birthday last year, the prime minister will spend the day in his home-state Gujarat attending a series of official events. The state is slated to go to polls later this year.
PM Modi will dedicate to the nation the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia, 56 years after the foundation was laid by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The 30 gates installed in it, closed on the directions of the Narmada Control Authority on June 17 this year, will be opened. The height of the dam was recently raised to 138.68 metres, facilitating a usable storage of 4.73 Million Acre feet (MAF) which will benefit the neighbouring states as well, a government release said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
CM Vijay Rupani told IANS that with the inauguration of the project, over 18 lakh hectares of land in the state would be benefitted with irrigation as Narmada water will flow to over 9,000 villages of Gujarat through a canal network.
The prime minister will then travel to Sadhu Bet, where the Statue of Unity, a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is currently under construction. PM Modi will be given an overview of the progress of work on the project. The project comprises a 182-metre tall statue, an exhibition hall, a memorial garden, and a visitor centre.
Post that, PM Modi will attend the closing ceremony of the Narmada Mahotsav and address a gathering at Dabhoi. He will lay the foundation stone for the National Tribal Freedom Fighters’ Museum during the event.
The prime minister is also scheduled to visit Amreli where he will inaugurate a new market yard of APMC along with throwing open plants of Amar Dairy and laying the foundation stone for a honey production centre. An address at the Sahakar Sammelan at Amreli is also planned."

Vijaya said the deployment of Vistadome coach on Bengaluru- Mangaluru route will be finalised only after SWR receives the coach.

It is close to 9pm. In the light beaming from the headlamp of his campaign car — a rented seven-seater covered in vinyl election posters — 36-year-old Rajesh Vasava, the Chhota Udepur candidate from Chhotu Vasava’s Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP), speaks to villagers seated on a mud path of Hanfeshwar in Kawant taluka of Chhota Udepur district. He urges them to vote for a candidate they think would address their problems – their right over the forest lands being snatched away from them, the unchecked sale of spurious liquor in tribal areas and the water crisis in the villages.
“Do you know that like some of you who lost your lands in the name of development, the government now has a good excuse to evict you from your homes because of a Supreme Court order?” he asked the crowd. “You cannot fetch wood, flowers or forest produce like before. Now, a forest officer can arrest you, shoot you and throw you out and no one will question him.”
He continued: “You all here may be thinking that the displacement of many of our tribal brothers has been done only in areas around the dam (on the Narmada) and statue (Statue of Unity) but soon you could be next.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He also told the crowd how those displaced from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have not been given adequate compensation till today. “So vote wisely no matter who you vote for,” he said.
Raj Vasava, as he is popularly known, says he wants to cover as many villages in the remotest places as possible and make the people aware of their rights, but his being a “poor, tribal party”, they don’t have funds. Unusually, therefore, Vasava began a crowdfunding campaign on his Facebook just a few days ago, urging his friends and supporters to help him raise money.
“I am probably the first candidate in Gujarat to start a crowdfunding for my election campaign. Kanhaiya Kumar has done it in Bihar,” he says. “The idea is to cover costs of travel as Chhota Udepur is a vast constituency with far flung villages even in jungle areas. I don’t have the funds but I want to make sure that I don’t leave out any village.”
He says the idea came from friends in Central University of Gujarat who are helping him make use of social media to the fullest. His crowdfunding appeal has received a positive response, and he has also shared details of his contributors. “I have already received contributions from wellwishers who are backing a change this time,” he says.
He hopes his campaign too will receive a positive response. However, he does not directly appeal for votes as he did for funds. Instead he reminds the people of the problems that are uniquely theirs and urges them to choose the right candidate to solve them.
“One group will come and tell you to vote for (Narendra) Modi, another will tell you to vote for Rahul (Gandhi) but it is up to you to think whether your problems on the ground affect Modi or Rahul. Will your distress affect the roti that they eat everyday?,” he asks the crowd gathered for the night meeting. “I am sure 99 of 100 children sitting here do not have chappals (slippers) on their feet. Look at the area around you, there is no electricity. But just a few days before elections, these people will come here and distribute a bottle of liquor or give you some money and lure you to vote for them,” Vasava told the crowd of men of all ages as well as teenage boys.
Dwelling on the issue of liquor being used to bribe voters in tribal areas, he tries to get the crowd to recognise its insidiousness. “All over the country there is free-flowing alcohol whereas Gujarat is the only state where alcohol has been prohibited for decades. Yet, it is also the state where alcohol is available in larger quantities than others,” Raj Vasava pointed out. “And, not the good quality liquor, but the quality that can harm you and at times also kill you. It is a problem in the tribal areas that many have spoken of,” he added, reminding the tribal people to think before casting their vote.
“To me, it doesn’t matter if you vote for me or not because I am always going to be in your midst. But it does matter whether you vote for the right candidate,” he tells them.
Vasava is London-educated. He is an alumnus of United College in London, where he completed his Diploma in Finance. It is a selling point in the special manifesto, a leaflet bearing 19 points in Gujarati, that he has distributed. Speaking of his background to The Indian Express, Vasava says his father, who worked at a fabrication firm, borrowed money from his friends to fund his studies in London. “That money helped me get through the first year in London. Thereafter, I worked at a local store as an assistant manager and paid my fees.” In his affidavit, Vasava has declared bank deposits of Rs 1.8 lakh and an income of about Rs 4.5 lakh in the past year. His wife, a resident doctor in Latur, Maharashtra, who belongs to a local tribal community there, has been supporting him in his activism. “She is studying to become an ENT specialist. She has been my backbone through it all since our wedding,” he says.
Vasava is not merely a London-educated youth parachuted to the constituency, however. He has been a part of various agitations undertaken by the BTP since its inception in 2017. “Of the three candidates here, I am the most educated. I have led tribal agitations in other states and also camped at Jantar Mantar just before the filing of nominations to protest against the Supreme court order that allows displacement of over 23 lakh tribal families from their forest homes,” he tells this newspaper, speaking in fluent English. “I will continue to be among the tribals and be their voice, (even if) not necessarily as their MP.”
In his “manifesto” he calls the tribal peoples “Desh ka Malik”. Vasava, who is a native of Bharuch district, urges the tribal people to unite instead of “dividing the place into territories of Rathwa, Bhil, Tadvi, Baria and Vasava sub castes”. The leaflet also promises to stop the displacement of tribal people, which is allegedly being done in the name of tourism projects associated with the Statue of Unity. He called it a “conspiracy” to grab tribal lands. These projects include the setting up of a railway line connecting Vadodara, Dabhoi, Chandod, and Kevadia and a proposed tiger safari among others.
The most important issue addressed by Vasava’s manifesto is water scarcity. Despite Chhota Udepur being a district on the Narmada basin with a major canal passing through, the villages here face acute water scarcity. “Their borewells have gone dry. The lack of local leadership has meant that their voice has not reached Parliament,” Vasava says. “Even the Hanfeshwar water pipeline project is only going to benefit Dahod. But what about Chhota Udepur?”
Vasava filed his nomination from the constituency after the BTP’s original candidate Narendra Rathwa was booked under PASA (Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act) and arrested minutes before he could complete his nomination at the district collector’s office. Rajesh Vasava is up against Geeta Rathwa of the BJP, which is trying to retain its seat for a third consecutive term, and Ranjitsinh Rathwa of the Congress. This is the first Lok Sabha election where voters of Chhota Udepur constituency have three new candidates – the constituency has always seen a contest between Naransinh Rathwa of the Congress party and Ramsinh Rathwa of the BJP since 1991."

Days after accusing the Congress of insulting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by its remarks on the Statue of Unity project, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Mann ki Baat on Sunday that the Time magazine had in 1947 observed that if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite India amid a plethora of problems, it was Patel.
The Prime Minister will unveil the Statue of Unity on Patel’s birth anniversary, October 31. The day is also the death anniversary of former PM Indira Gandhi, to whom Modi paid tributes during his monthly radio address.
Dedicating a large part of his address to Patel, the Prime Minister recalled that on January 27, 1947, Time had a photograph of Patel on its cover.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“In their lead story, they had depicted a map of India; it was nowhere close to what the map looks like now. It was the map of an India that was divided into myriad fragments. There existed over 550 princely states. The English had lost interest in India; they wanted to leave India fragmented into pieces. Time magazine had opined that hovering over India then were the dangers of problems like partition, violence, food scarcity, price rise and power-politics. The magazine further observed that amidst that plethora of problems, if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite the country and heal wounds, it was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” he said.
“… Gandhiji considered Sardar Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act. Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp and weft of unity on the axis of a single thread. He ensured the merger of all princely states with the Dominion of India…if we are able to see a United India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity and strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel,” the Prime Minister said.

He said October 31 will be special as on that day the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation as a true tribute to Patel. Highlighting that it is the world’s tallest statue, the Prime Minister said, “Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil, will adorn our skies too.”
He said today, the whole world, especially western countries, are discussing about environment protection. “…we only have to look inward, to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions… To live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities,” he said and referred to the Bhil tribes of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which worship Peepal and Arjun trees.
“…the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights. There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities. Who can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who struggled hard against the British Empire to save their own forest land.”
The Prime Minister said that for India, November 11 this year has a special significance because on that day a hundred years ago, the World War I ended. “Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war. Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice… There has just been a single objective behind it — restoration of peace. The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during World War I… This made the whole world realise and understand the importance of peace. The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years,” he said, adding that today, peace does not only mean “no war”.
“There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination. Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace,” he said."

Alleging that Modi spent hundreds of crores of rupees on advertising his “Make in India” campaign to build his image within and outside the country, the Congress leader said that “handing over the contract of the statue project to Chinese amounts to betrayal of the promises made with the people of the country”.
The Chinese company is reported to have promised to complete the project within two and a half years.

“Till now, 16 seaplane routes have been identified under Regional Connectivity Routes under UDAN scheme,” the Ministry of Shipping said in a statement.
“Seaplane projects will provide faster and hassle free travel option for the long, treacherous and hilly regions of the country,” it said.
Mandaviya said Sabarmati and Narmada River-Statue of Unity seaplane route will save time and boost tourism, as it provides a bird eye view of Narmda Valley and Statue of Unity.
The minister instructed the officials to come up with Indian model of waterdrome (terminal), after thorough study of the waterdrome infrastructure of the countries like the USA, Canada, Maldives and Australia.
He also directed Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) and Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to join hands to commence the seaplane operation of the Sabarmati and Statue of Unity route by October, 2020.

The Gujarat High Court on Friday registered a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) and issued notice to the state government, including the health and legal departments, to stop the spread of coronavirus in the state’s judicial set up.
The order passed by the division bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath observed that the central and state governments have been taking precautionary measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. The bench directed that all government advisories — state and central — be strictly adhered to, “in letter and in spirit”.
To ensure safety in courts, the HC directed the state government to provide “temperature guns” at the security check to check the temperature of those entering the court premises. If anyone is found with body temperature above normal, further investigation will be carried out. The HC also directed the state government to sanitise the court premises on daily basis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The respondents are expected to file an affidavit within a week by March 20 with a status update on the situation pursuant to the court’s directions.

Udgam School for Children and Zebar School for Children have extended its annual break. “The best prevention of coronavirus seems to be social distancing… We closed on February 6 as per our annual schedule after the annual exams got over. But we will not be able to start by March 30, as scheduled,” said Manan Choksi, executive director of Udgam School for Children.
Indian Institue of Technology Gandhinagar is minimising visitors to the campus and has extended its mid-semester recess by two weeks till March 29. Workshops and lecture series planned for March and April too have been postponed, according to the IITGn communication cell. A five-member task force has been constituted and a set of quarantine residencies to house the affected persons has been readied.
The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) has instructed his staff to stop using biometric from March 6. “If any advisory comes to shut down the institute, we have advised the faculty to be ready with learning material to share with students online,” said Arindam Das, director of NIFT.
The Central University of Gujarat has constituted a four-member committee and has instructed staff and students who visited COVID-19 affected nations recently to report before the committee.
Industries
The textile and diamond industries in Surat that employ a huge number of migrant workforce is taking extra measures to fight the threat of COVID-19. The Hare Krishna Diamond firm, which has around 8,000 employees working at one place, has distributed masks to their employees and their family members.
Firm owner Savji Dholakia’s personal assistant, Naresh Miyani, told this paper, “Diamond artisans have been told to clean their hands before and after work with sanitiser kept at all washrooms in the factory.” Masks have been kept at the factory entrance for even visitors.
Surat, also a textile hub, has over 150 textile markets with around 65,000 trading shops. The Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) president Manoj Agrawal said, “We have advised textile traders to put on masks while at shops and regularly wash hands. Many of them who are from other states that have reported positive cases of coronavirus have postponed plans to visit their native places. Even the footfall of customers from other states in the textile markets has also gone down.”
South Gujarat Textile Pro-cessing Association president, Jitu Vakhariya, said, “Here in textile dying and printing factories, nobody wears mask as the temperature inside the factory is high.”
Western Rly gears up with masks, disinfectants as ticket bookings drop
In the wake of increasing scare of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in the country, the Western Railways has geared up to check the spread with sensitisation campaigns, creation of isolation wards, disinfectant spraying in railway premises and providing safety gear to all staff.
According to Western Railway officials, due to coronavirus scare, they have witnessed a 10-15% drop in ticket bookings in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Western Railway runs 939 trains (mail/express and passenger) connecting 510 railway stations across six divisions in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Around one lakh staff are employed with the Western Railway and on an average, 43.95 lakh passengers use the network every day.
“We have witnessed 10-15% drop in ticket bookings in the past one week due to Coronavirus. Western Railways is well equipped and have made sure that all our cleaning staff, loco drivers, travel ticket examiners (TTE) and other officials present on the railway premises in Gujarat and Maharashtra are equipped with safety gear, including masks, disinfectants and gloves. We are also ensuring that all train doors, bathroom knobs, railings, handles and other objects that are constantly touched by the passengers are sprayed with disinfectants regularly,” said Ravindra Bhakar, spokesperson, Western Railways.
It has also made arrangements for isolation wards in their hospitals in case of admission of any COVID-19 suspect patient. “We have a total of 7 hospitals in all six divisions of the Western Railways and in each hospital, a separate isolation ward has been set up to quarantine suspected patients. Till now, we have had only one suspected patient who came to one of our hospitals in Maharashtra and his test reports turned out to be negative. In Ahmedabad, there are eight beds at the Sabarmati Hospital’s isolation ward of the Ahmedabad zone of Western Railways,” said Bhakar.
The challenge for Western Railways to maintain a clean and hygienic environment will be difficult as according to the last year’s Swachhta (cleanliness) rankings released by the Indian Railways, Western Railways ranking dropped by 5 slots compared to its score in 2018 out of the 16 zones across India. Ahmedabad Railway station ranked at 202 out of 720 stations, Vadodara station at 90, Jamnagar at 103, Gandhidham at 110, Surat at 16 and Udhna railway station at 16.
“I believed that airports are much vulnerable given people travel overseas and come back. However, given the poor condition of railway stations in India, even here is not safe and one must follow personal hygiene and safety measures even while travelling in trains,” said Uddhav Bhatt, an Ahmedabad-based resident at Kalupur railway station.
The Western Railway officials said that the passengers are being sensitised through video as well as audio broadcast on the railway premises. “Apart from posters of Dos and Don’ts, we have also arranged for broadcast for public safety messages on coronavirus through LED screens at railway premises and audio messages are also being broadcast from time to time,” said an official of Ahmedabad division."

Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana 05/06/2017
Following instructions from the Petroleum Ministry, oil and gas PSUs will pay at least Rs 200 crore for the Statue of Unity, the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel which is being installed at the Sadhu Bet island, 3.5 km south of the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in Narmada district of Gujarat. While Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corp (IOC) will contribute Rs 50 crore each out of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, other profit-making public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been told to pay Rs 25 crore each.
“Other oil sector PSU, particularly IOC, has already been directed to contribute in tune of Rs 50 crore for this project. Other than ONGC and IOC, other oil sector PSUs are contributing Rs 25 crore. By taking into consideration the total cost of the project, we may consider the proposal for grant of Rs 50 crore,” says the agenda note, approved by Chairman and Managing Director, ratified by the ONGC board in April. A GAIL India official confirmed that instructions were given by the Ministry last March for all oil and gas companies to support the project in “a collaborative mode”.
“It was conveyed at a CSR review meeting. No written order was issued,” the official said. Oil India Ltd, GAIL India Ltd, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have approved Rs 25 crore each for the project, taking the collective contribution so far to Rs 200 crore.  This would take care of nearly a fifth of the planned expenditure of Rs 1,040 crore for the Statue of Unity in financial year 2017-18. When asked about these directions, Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum, K D Tripathi, declined to comment.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
ONGC said the project’s admissibility for CSR funds under Schedule VII of the Companies Act was “well covered” under promoting education, health and hygiene especially for tribal populace among others…ensuring environmental sustainability and protection of national heritage, art and culture. The agenda note also cites Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan’s suggestion that ONGC can “reposition its CSR funds to meet Department of Public Enterprises’ directives to spend 33 per cent of CSR budget on Swachh Bharat activities”.
The agenda paper shows that 14 state-run Gujarat companies had extended Rs 104.88 crore as financial support for the project. Among them, top donors include Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (Rs 17 crore); Gujarat State Financial Services Ltd (Rs 15.88 crore); Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (Rs 15 crore); Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited and Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (Rs 10 crore each).
Under construction since October 2014, the statue is envisaged as the world’s tallest when completed. Its contract was awarded to Larsen and Toubro for Rs 2989 crore with a targeted completion date of October 2018. The statue complex is planned to be spread over 20,000 square m of project area and will be surrounded by an artificial lake."

(Source: RSTV/PTI Photo)
In his over an hour long reply to the debate on Motion of Thanks to President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday touched upon a wide range of issues, including Jharkhand mob lynching case, Bihar encephalitis deaths, allegation over EVM tampering and others.
Jharkhand mob lynching
PM Narendra Modi said though the mob lynching incident in Jharkhand had deeply pained him and he wishes the guilty to be punished, it is entirely wrong on the Opposition’s part to call the state ‘a hub of lynching’. He also said that all kinds of violence, whether in Jharkhand or West Bengal or Kerala, should be treated as same and law should take its course.



“The lynching in Jharkhand has pained me. It has saddened others too. Guilty should get the severest punishment but for this the entire state has been pronounced guilty and everyone put in the dock, which is not right,” he said. “Is this fair? Why are they insulting a state,” he said, adding, “None of us have the right to insult the state of Jharkhand,” he said.
Modi, who had received flak from the Opposition over his ‘silence’ on the lynching incident in the BJP-ruled Jharkhand, said, “security of every citizen is our constitutional duty”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Bihar encephalitis deaths
On the death of more than 130 children in Bihar where BJP and its ally JDU are in power, PM Modi said, “In modern times, such a situation is a matter of pain as well as shame for all of us. This is the biggest failure in the last seven decades and we should take it seriously.”
The PM also said that he is in constant touch with the Bihar government and hoped that the crisis will be over soon.
On Opposition’s remarks on farmers
Targeting the Congress for calling their loss in the general elections as “a defeat of the country, democracy and farmers”, PM Modi said that the opposition party is heaping “insult” to the public mandate.



Congress leaders, he said, are saying farmers were sold out to Rs 2,000 cash dole and the elections were won with the help of media. “This is an insult to farmers. A farmer is not available for sale. Farmers cannot be insulted. The use of language that they were sold for Rs 2,000 is an insult to 15 crore farmers,” he said.
Stalling of bills in Rajya Sabha
Modi criticised the Opposition for stalling the bills in the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling NDA does not have the majority. Quoting former president Pranab Mukherjee, the Prime Minister said that the Opposition has a right to question but not obstruct. He also sought protection from the Chair to help government get through important legislations.
At least 22 bills had lapsed in the Rajya Sabha that were passed by the 16th Lok Sabha, including Triple Talaq and making Aadhaar an optional ID proof for obtaining mobile sim cards and opening bank accounts.
The Prime Minister said the upper house is part of the federal structure of the country and the members must introspect and cooperate in the framing of crucial legislations. “Parties which obstructed constructive government work in Rajya Sabha have been punished by the voters in the recent general elections,” the Prime Minister said.
“We don’t have majority in Rajya Sabha but verdict of the people should not be throttled in the House,” he added.
On opposition’s call for return to old India
Taking a jibe at Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, PM Modi said some people demanded a return to ‘Old India’ instead of the ‘New India’ where technology is being used to ease lives and end corruption.
“Do they want an Old India where Cabinet decision is torn in a press conference, where Navy assets are used for picnic, where scams are order of the day, where ‘tukde-tukde’ (separatist) gang gets support of leaders, where middlemen are required for railway tickets, MP’s letter is needed for gas connection, where interviews are held for low-level jobs such as peon in a government department and there is rampant inspector raj,” he said.
“The citizens of the country are not willing to go back to the old India,” he said, adding the ‘new India’ is destined to come.
On EVM tampering allegations
On the Opposition’s repeated claims about EVM tampering, PM Modi said those who are opposing EVMs are not only opposed to EVMs alone but technology itself. “There have been so many polls with EVMs and parties that are represented in the Rajya Sabha have got opportunities to govern in some state or the other after elections conducted through EVMs. Then, why question EVMs today,” PM Modi said.
“Some people kept talking about the EVM issue in this House. I want to tell them- there was a time when we were two MPs in the Parliament. People mocked us. But, we worked harder and won the trust of people. We did not make excuses and blame the polling booth,” he added.



He also said that only two parties went to the Election Commission on its invitation to verify the authenticity of EVMs. “But, why did the rest of the parties questioning the EVMs not even go, they should answer,” he said.
NRC
The Prime Minister also took the Congress to task for its “clamour for credit” saying why it was not doing so in case of National Register for Citizens (NRC) as it was first agreed to by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Assam Accord.
NRC is not a vote bank issue for this government. It is an issue of national security, he said, adding the move to list citizens and identify outsiders was done on the orders of the Supreme Court.
Vallabhbhai Patel
PM Modi said while Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a Congress leader, it is his party’s belief that had he been the first prime minister of the country, the J&K issue would not have existed.
Taking a swipe at the Congress, he said Patel was their party leader and they should at least once go to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat to pay homage.
The party should in fact hold their Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting there, he said. “Azad saheb kuch din guzarei Gujarat mein (Azad saheb please spend some days in Gujarat),” Modi quipped, using a tagline of Gujarat Tourism.
Economy
On the Congress’ claim of Indian economy expanding by only USD 0.8 trillion to USD 2.8 billion in five years, PM Modi said under his rule the economy has expanded by nearly half when compared to USD 2 trillion added in 60 years of Congress rule.

Honourable Members,
25. As a result of my Government’s sustained efforts and series of policy initiatives, our economy is again on the high growth trajectory. According to the latest estimates, our GDP is growing at 7.4%, which makes India the fastest growing large economy in the world. Inflation and Food inflation, in particular, are at a record low due to a number of decisive measures taken by the Government. Fixed capital formation, which faced a near stagnation in the last few years, has increased. Capital Markets are upbeat. Our external sector is now far more resilient, particularly with a moderate current account deficit and a broadly stable rupee. Our foreign exchange reserves have been substantially augmented.

The PM said Sardar Saheb was a true secularist,we also say that. The country needs Sardar Patels brand of secularism and not votebank secularism. Sardar was secular but his secularism did not come in the way of building Somnath Temple. The kind of secularism followed by Sardar Patel does not divide the country but unites it, said Modi.
Speaking at the foundation-laying ceremony of the Statue of Unity of Patel,which was also attended by BJP patriarch L K Advani,Modi said,Associating Sardar Patel with any party would do great injustice to him. His greatness is associated with Indias history. We must not divide our legacy, said Modi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
On Wednesday,Singh and Modi had engaged in a public spat over Patels legacy at the inauguration of the renovated Sardar Patel Museum,where Modi had said the countrys fate would have been different if Patel had been its first prime minister. Singh had responded by reminding Modi of Patels unshakable commitment to secularism and his association with the Congress.
Modi also blamed the Centre for the delay in constructing the gates at the Sardar Sarovar dam. I have repeatedly asked the PM to allow us to build the gates at the Sardar Sarovar dam. A meeting that would give approval has been pending for eight-nine months. Gujarat,Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh,which have to take care of rehabilitation,have completed their work,but the approval for the gates is pending.
I am prepared to erect a huge plaque with the inscription that the Congress government in Delhi has done this work. I will not even visit the inauguration and allow them to cut the ribbon,if they so want,but there should be no politics over it, he said.

Speaking at the launch of the guided tour programme of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi “apologised” to fellow judges saying he had not taken their permission before venturing into it. “So far my colleagues are concerned, I seek their post facto approval. The decision was entirely mine. I did not consult any of you. I apologise but I hope you will approve. It’s an experiment, a very limited exposure to the Supreme Court, a public institution that I thought… should be opened up in a limited way.” Initially, tourists will be allowed into the court on Saturdays. They will have to register online.
Seat Speculation
With top BJP leaders meeting on Thursday to finalise the candidates for Madhya Pradesh election, speculation is rife that the list could disappoint a number of leaders. Senior leaders involved in electioneering in Madhya Pradesh would go to the state for “fire-fighting”, sources said. As party sources admitted that the three-term government could have left many disenchanted, they indicated that there could be changes in around 50 sitting seats.
Late Arrival
Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani visited Lucknow last month to personally invite his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath to the inauguration of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s ‘Statue of Unity’ in Narmada district. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity on Wednesday, and the grand event was focused on Patel and Modi. However, Adityanath skipped the event in Narmada and stayed in Lucknow. He will, however, be visiting Narmada on Friday and touring the Statue of Unity. Adityanath will be accompanied by officials and engineers of the government, who will explore the place for building a UP guest house."

“This is a very positive step. First the (construction of the) dam, now the statue, this will change the fate of this region,” said 63-year-old Farooq Memon, who was displaced to Jetpur from his village in Kevadia for the construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, in 1993. Twenty-five years later, he made it a point to attend the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue dedicated to India’s first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “I wouldn’t have missed this opportunity at any cost. Looking at the statue, standing so tall, it makes me feel proud,” Memon said.
Memon is among the many such local residents in and around Narmada district who attended the inaugural ceremony “with a sense of pride”.
Apart from the local residents, 200 Gujaratis from across 20 states also attended the unveiling ceremony.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Sardar Patel had supervised the merger of more than 550 princely states into the Indian union, which included Hyderabad. Exactly 70 years ago, Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan was forced to merge his princely state with India. Crediting the same, Mahesh Patel, president of Shri Gujarati Pragati Samaj in Hyderabad, said, “We have lived in Hyderabad for 48 years now. But we have families from Gujarat settled in Hyderabad for over a century. Before Independence, a few Gujarati families had taken permission from the Nizam to set up their businesses here in the city. They soon settled in Sahukari Karwaan close to the Golconda fort and since that day, this settlement has become a Gujarati settlement in Hyderabad. Today that settlement has a population of over 2.5 lakh. We feel that such a tribute is a must for the man who kept us united.”
SS Sarvanan, an MLA from Madurai South constituency in Tamil Nadu, attended the event along with 15 other NRGs from across Tamil Nadu. “We feel privileged to have been invited for this event. In 2009, Narendra Modi had identified us in Tamil Nadu for the first time. He united us in Tamil Nadu like Sardar Patel united the entire nation,” Sarvanan said. “During that time when the infamous Ghazani Mohammed invaded Northern India from Afghanistan, which included parts of Saurashtra, a few families migrated to south to escape from the series of invasions. They then settled in Tamil Nadu. Today that number has reached to a population of 20 lakh,” he added.

Days after the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL) completed the fencing of farmlands it had acquired in 1961 in five villages of Nandod taluka in Narmada district for the purpose of the construction of the dam at its original site, the district administration has formed teams to keep villagers away from the farms as monsoon has set in.
Five teams comprising a deputy collector, a deputy mamlatdar and other clerical staff have been formed to visit the six villages —Kevadia, Vaghadia, Limdi, Gora, Navagam and Kothi — located around the 182 metre tall Statue of Unity, where SSNNL in May fenced lands it had acquired in 1961. The execution of the fencing following the dismissal of the PIL in the Gujarat High Court saw multiple incidents of clashes between villagers and the police.
On Monday, the administration filed a police complaint against two villagers from Gora for allegedly trespassing a land acquired when they began ploughing the field like every year. The complaint filed by Deputy Mamlatdar of Kevadia administration Vipul Makwana against villager Dinesh Tadvi and his tractor driver Chetan Tadvi said they “wilfully trespassed the land” .Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

We will take legal action against trespassers..” While Dinesh Tadvi refused to comment, another villager from Kevadia, Soma Tadvi, said, “The villagers have no source of income without farming. When the monsoon sets in, we plough our fields to begin sowing crops like tuver (pigeon peas) and maize.”"

The Narmada district administration is planning to introduce home stay accommodation for tourists visiting the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, in Kevadia Colony.
According to the District Development Officer, 116 houses have been identified in 22 villages around the Statue of Unity where home stay accommodations will be developed.
“We have identified 116 houses where 252 rooms will be renovated as home stay accommodations for tourists. The houses were shortlisted based on whether they are pucca houses which will make the renovation process easy and whether there is a spare room in the house which can be utilised for the purpose,” said District Development Officer, Jimcy Williams.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“The revenue earned will be divided among the local contractors who will supervise at the local level and the women who will host the tourists in the house. We have approached various organisations for CSR funds to cover the cost of the project,” Williams added. Facilities, including renovation or construction of rooms and washrooms at each house is estimated to cost between Rs 2 to Rs 2.5 lakh each.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
As soon as the home stay accommodation is operational, the details will be made available on the website. Apart from these home stays, the statue complex that was inaugurated in October 2018, already has two tent cities, a Shreshtha Bharat Bhavan and Kevadia Circuit House, to house tourists."

Since 2018, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the statue, Kevadia, has seen 31 additional tourist attractions and the formation of the Statue of Unity Area Development and Tourism Governance Authority or Statue of Unity Tourism Authority (SoUTA), which by default overrides the power of the local bodies. On the ground, however, parties have fielded candidates to fill the mandatory seats for the Narmada district panchayat and the Garudeshwar taluka panchayat.
The BJP, which came into power in Garudeshwar taluka panchayat — the only one of the five in the district the party managed to win in 2015 — has been out of power in the district panchayat. For local BJP leaders, winning the district panchayat in Narmada, where the Congress has the majority is a matter of prestige due to the growing relevance of the district on the tourism map.
The Kevadia seat for the district panchayat is currently held by Congress’s Dinesh Jesinh Tadvi.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
This time the BJP has fielded a local tribal and the namesake of the current Congress representative, Dinesh Tadvi, from Kevadia village. More so, because Dinesh Tadvi, until June last year, was also leading the people of six villages that were protesting the land acquisition by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) in Kevadia, Vaghadia, Limdi, Gora, Navagam and Kothi. Dinesh Tadvi, who withdrew himself from the protests mid-way last year, is now hoping to win the seat for the BJP — the party that he was vehemently opposing until last year.
In his maiden election contest, Dinesh Tadvi says, “The reason for contesting is to ensure that the people here have a voice in the panchayat, where speaking up can bring change. The fact is that the government has already made its decision to take possession of the lands they acquired in 1961. They have decided to shift most villagers out based on the documents they have. Those who are not directly affected need a voice and I am only trying to be the means for it.”
A local resident catapulted to a panchayat candidate, however, has not gone down too well with the local party leaders, most of whom have stayed away from his campaign on foot. Dinesh Tadvi, however, has been campaigning in the villages that are closest to the SoU and seeking votes for “development”. 
While at some places, villagers have asked pointed questions: “are they going to take our homes?”. At some others, villagers have come out in support and blessed the “son of the village”.
Locals do not deny that the SoU and the ancillary tourist businesses that are coming up in the taluka have generated employment opportunities for local tribals. Ramila Tadvi, a resident of Limbdi village, says, “Many youths of the village have been chosen after training to work in various capacities in the projects and it has definitely made up for the missing opportunities but there are many more youths who are still unemployed and some have been rendered landless during the displacement. There are many families that have not been able to find their stability after being uprooted. So many elections have gone by and we are still living in the fear of being evicted. When will this end?”
A few metres away from Dinesh Tadvi’s own house in Kevadia, where another villager Natwar Tadvi attempted self-immolation in June last year to prevent SSNNL from fencing his fields, the family of 40 members is unsure if they would vote for their fellow villager.
Natwar Tadvi says, “Dinesh is a friend and he fought for us but he did withdraw his support when we needed it. We cannot trust the BJP. The Congress and the BTP have been more vocal in supporting us. The issue of our lands and homes has remained unresolved. We have not been offered any decent compensation yet and to top it, the new Authority will soon be breathing on our neck.”
The Congress candidate this time is the son of the current sitting panchayat member Dinesh Jesinh Tadvi and is not a resident of Kevadia village. But the mostly illiterate villagers can’t help raise the pertinent question of the relevance of the panchayat seats for local issues since the SoUTA is on the cards — construction has begun to build the sprawling office from where the officers will administer the area.

In December last year, the General Administration Department (GAD) of the government of Gujarat released the government plan for the SoUTA, announcing two circles of management that will have 201 personnel for the operation and maintenance, water supply, sewage lines, roads, parking, lights as well as the decorative lighting in the area of 25 sq metres of Kevadia colony.
A top government official of the district says, “Kevadia will be governed by the SoUTA. All civic needs and developments will be taken care of by the SoUTA. The power to use the funds that the government sends for the local area development will also rest with SoUTA. But one cannot say that the relevance of the panchayat will be gone. There are many other issues that need to be tackled at the panchayat level, which will be outside the purview of the SoUTA — for instance roads inside villages. But the panchayat will not have the power to override the SoUTA wherever it is applicable.”
 
Kevadia, which is part of the Garudeshwar taluka panchayat and one of the 22 seats of the Narmada District Panchayat, is hardly touched by the election fever that has gripped other parts of the neighbouring talukas. The Congress had won the Narmada district panchayat with 10 of 22 seats while the BJP and BTP (as JD(U)) won six each."

The Kevadia police on Wednesday arrested two security guards at the Statue of Unity for thrashing their colleague a day before. On Tuesday, Rajusingh Yadav (38) was checking if the security staff are present at their designated spots, when he found Balwantbhai Tadvi missing. When Yadav called Balwantbhai to cross-check, the latter shared a false location, Yadav alleged in his complaint.
Later in the afternoon, when Balwantbhai approached Yadav for a half-day leave, Yadav informed his higher-ups about the incident when Balwantbhai was missing from his spot. The same evening, Balwantbhai, along with the other accused, Naresh Tadvi, thrashed Yadav at SoU’s gate number 2.
Yadav then filed a police complaint against Balwantbhai and Naresh.
“We have arrested the accused based on the complaint and eye-witness accounts. No weapons were used but the complainant received minor injuries and was given preliminary treatment,” said investigating officer Karsan Rathwa."

My Dear countrymen, Namaskar. The year 2018 is about to conclude. We shall soon enter 2019. At such a juncture, it is natural to reflect on the year gone by; it is equally so, to hear about resolutions for the year being ushered in. Whether it be the life of an individual, the life of a society at large or the life of a Nation collectively, everybody has to look back & ponder; at the same time one has to try & look forward to the best extent possible. Only then can the gains of experience be availed of, only then can one’s self-confidence renew further. What exactly should we do in order to ensure a change in our lives, simultaneously contributing our bit in taking our country & society forward? Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019. You must have wondered how to keep 2018 etched in your memory! It is important to bear in mind HOW India as a country, as a collective entity powered by the might of a hundred & thirty crore people remembers the year 2018; something that swells our hearts with pride.
The year 2018 saw the launching of the world’s biggest health insurance scheme ‘Ayushman Bharat’. Electricity reached each & every village of the country this year. Noted world institutions have accepted that the country has taken strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace. On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95% mark.
After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government. In honour of SardarVallabhbhai Patel who bonded the entire country around a common thread of unity, India witnessed the coming up of the tallest statue in the world, ‘Statue of Unity’. The country secured a place of pride & glory in the entire world. The highest United Nations Environment Award ‘Champions of the Earth’ was conferred upon India. The world duly took notice of India’s efforts in the areas of Solar Energy & Climate Change. The first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held in India. It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the ‘Ease of doing business’ rankings. The country’s self defence mechanism got further reinforced. It was during this very year that our country has successfully accomplished the Nuclear Triad, which means we are now armed with nuclear capabilities-in water, on land and in the sky as well. Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama. India’s first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi. This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The longest rail-road bridge, Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the Nation- Sikkim’s first & India’s hundredth airport, Pakyong commenced operations. India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup. This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games. India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too. By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character & the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry! And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen. I sincerely hope that India’s journey on the path of advancement & progress continues through 2019 too. Taking her to newer heights with her inner strengths.
My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen. On the 19th of December, Dr. Jayachandran passed away in Chennai. People fondly called him ‘MakkalMaaruthuvar’ since he had a special place in their hearts. Dr. Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor. People tell us that he would be ever ready & eager, when it came to treatment of patients. In the case of elderly patients, he would even bear the cost of their travelling to and fro. On the betterindia.com website, I have read about many of his endeavours that serve as an inspiration to society.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka. SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth. In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services. In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri. There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society. Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged. Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done. Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps. The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise. Today, I’m saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the ‘Swachch Bharat Mission’ a successful campaign. I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
In this ‘Mahayagya’, grand undertaking, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary bodies, School- College students, the people of Jabalpur; in fact everyone participated with enthusiasm & Zest. I just referred to the betterindia.com, where I got to read about Dr. Jaya Chandran. Whenever I get the opportunity, I visit the better India website and try to know more about such shining, inspiring deeds. I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems. Just as thepoitiveindia.com is doing great work in spreading positivity and infusing more sensitivity into society. Similarly, success stories of young innovators & entrepreneurs are women beautifully on yourstory.com. In the same way, you can easily learn the Sanskrit language sitting at home through samskritabharati.in. Can we join hands in one endeavour?.. Let us share such websites amongst ourselves. Let’s come together to make positivity viral.
I do believe that by doing so more and more people will get to know about our heroes who brought a change in society. Spreading negativity is fairly easy. But some really good work is being done around us, in our society. And all this has been possible through the collective efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
Sports has its own significance in every society. When a game is being played, the spectators too experience a rush of energy in their beings. We observe name, fame and laurels when it comes to sportspersons. But, at times, in the background, there exist many things that are much higher, much greater than the world of sports. Let me tell you about one of our daughters from Kashmir who won a gold medal in a Karate Championship in Korea. Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir. Hanaya trained hard in Karate with perseverance & fervor, studied its nuances and proved herself. On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future. Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya. Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani. You too must have read it. Rajani has won a gold medal at the Junior Women’s Boxing Championship. The moment Rajani won the medal she rushed to a nearby milk stall & drank a glass of milk. After that, she wrapped a cloth around the medal & kept it in a bag. You must be wondering why Rajani did that ! She did it in honour of her father Jasmer Singh ji who sells lassi, at a stall in Panipat. According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is. Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up. When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could. Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially. Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart & went ahead with her training in boxing. She has won a medal in Serbia too.
My best wishes and blessings to Rajani. I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting & encouraging Rajani. This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle. She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day. Just imagine… 300 kms of cycling every day ! Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable. Don’t news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us? Especially my young friends, when we hear about such feats, we derive inspiration to touch heights despite obstacles.
If your resolve is strong, if your fervor, your enthusiasm is without bounds, all your hurdles halt in their tracks. Hardships can never turn into obstacles. When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, the month of January ushers in many festivals filled with hope & joy- such as Lohri, Pongal, MakrSankranti, Uttarayan, MaghBihu, Maaghi; on the occasion of these festivities, the length & breadth of India will be replete… with the verve of traditional dances at places, the embers of Lohri symbolizing the joy of a bountiful harvest at others. Somewhere the skies dotted with colourful flying kites, elsewhere the funfilled air of a mela or carnival. The spirit of Sports & games will come to the fore… and at places, people will joyfully feed each other til&gur… sesame &jaggery… people will be heard exchanging the greeting phrase ‘Tilgurghyaaanigorgor bola’!
All these festivals may carry different names but the underlying or inherent feeling of celebrating them is singular – these are harvest festivals and somewhere or the other are connected with crops and farming, connected with the farmer, with the village and with our barns. It is during this period that the sun enters Uttarayan due to Northward movement of the earth on the celestial sphere and enters the Makardasha. It is during this period that days begin to lengthen and the winter harvesting of our crops begins. Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.
Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India. We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature. In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality. A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals. It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies. This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events. The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals. It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow. In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals. GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals. Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds. Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti. Our festivals, impart to us many social values. On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life – the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood. I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season. Doo share the photographs taken on these festivals with one another so that everyone can witness the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is an abundance of events in our culture, of which we can be proud and display them in the entire world with pride – and one of them is the Kumbh Mela. You must have heard a lot about Kumbh. Even in films, a lot is exhibited regarding its grandeur and magnificence and most truly so, the dimensions ofKumbh are vast – supremely divine, as much magnificent. People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh. In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence. Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage. This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place. The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started. It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh. The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh. The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries; the divinity emanating from Kumbhwill spread the colours of India’s splendour throughout the world.
Kumbh Mela is also a huge medium of self discovery, where every visitor experiences a unique feeling and learns to look at the worldly things from a spiritual perspective. This can be a huge learning experience especially for the youth. I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were progressing on a war footing. People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh. I inaugrated the Integrated Command & Control Center at the Kumbh which will be of great benefit to the devotees.
This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh. If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide. This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence. This great symbol of people’s faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of. Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone. I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith also become Mahakumbh of ofnationalism.
And a Mahakumbh of National integration
May this Kumbh of the devotees also become Mahakumbh of global tourists.
May this Kumbh of aesthetics also become the Mahakumbh of creativity.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity regardingthe celebration of RepublicDay on 26th January, when we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu. We are fortunate that South African President Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest. Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond. It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the ‘Mahatma’. It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid. He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world.
The year2018 is also being celebrated as Birth centenary of Nelson Mandela,also known as ‘Madiba’. We all know that Nelson Mandela was the role model of struggle against racism all over the world and who was the inspiration for Mandela? He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself. Mandela said this about Bapu – “Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because it was here that he used his first experiment with truth; It was here, That he had displayed a great deal of determination for justice; It was here, he developed the philosophy of his satyagraha and his methods of struggle. “Mandela used to consider Bapu as his role model. Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on the banks of Narbada in Gujarat, where the world’s highest statue ‘Statue of Unity’ is situated, there I had a meaningful discussion with the top policemen of the country. What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail. At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of ‘Sardar Patel Award’ for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form. Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country. He always remained engaged in keeping India’s integrity intact. SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land. It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel’s aspirations through this award for National Integration.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date ofthe sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh ji’s birth anniversary. Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna. For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra. His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded. In a way, entire India received his blessings. A glimpse of his life span reflects a glimpse of the entire India. After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender ageof nine years. Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus. He was bestowed with a quiet and simple personality, but whenever, an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, or injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said –
“I can make one fight against one hundred and fifteen thousands,
I can make the sparrow fight against the hawk
That be the reason that Gobindsingh be my name.”
He used to preach that strength cannot be demonstrated by fighting against the weaker sections. Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering. He was a divine figure full of heroism, valor, courage, sacrifice and devotion. He had beatific knowledge of both weapons andShaastras. He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages. I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good events happening in the country, which are not widely discussed. Such a unique effort is being attempted by F.S.S.A.I viz Food Safety and Standard Authority of India. Many programs are being organized across the country in celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. In this regard F.SA.A.I. is engaged in promoting good eating or Safe and Healthy Diet habits. Under the aegis of “Eat Right India” campaign, ‘Swasth Bharat’ trips are being carried out across the country. These campaigns will last till Jan 27th. At times, government organizations are tagged as a regulator, but it is commendable that F.SA.A.I has been working beyond this brief for public awareness and public education. A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also. Nutritious food is most essential for good health. In this context, I extend hearty greetings to F.S.S.A.I for this initiative. I urge you to the utmost, let’s join this initiative. You should participate in this initiative and especially I urge you to make you children witness these campaigns. The education regarding importance of food is essential right from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last episode of the year 2018, we will meet again in 2019, and will engage in another episode of Mann Ki Baat. Whether it is the life of a person, life of a nation, or the lifespan of a society, inspiration, is the basis of progress.

A year after its inauguration on October 31, 2018, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Statue of Unity (SoU) is undergoing maintenance with several teams of cleaners perched on the statue by way of magnetic ropes and rope-suspended platforms to clean the world’s tallest statue of 182 metres. Officials of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) refuted reports that the statue is undergoing a “structural modification”, but say that the SoU — which has a bronze cladding — will gradually change its colour from the existing brown to green, eventually settling at a shade of grey.
According to SoU officials, the maintenance and cleaning activities have been undertaken by deploying trained personnel to physically clean the statue from head to toe, literally. Refuting reports that the statue is undergoing a structural modification in order to make the bronze cladding “openable” for maintenance purposes, SSNNL officials said that removable panels of the cladding have been in place throughout the structure, since the design’s inception.
Chief Engineer PC Vyas told this newspaper, “There are many portions of the approximately 6,600 pieces of the bronze cladding which are removable to allow maintenance staff to reach the facade of the statue. This was in place since the design stage and there is no structural modification being made right now. The cleaning staff which is well-trained is going about the statue’s cleaning with the help of magnetic ropes and wire suspended platforms, wherever they can be put.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Vyas said that while some removable panels are part of the chest of the statue, which also houses the viewing gallery, the head of the statue is accessible only to the maintenance teams by design. “The cleaners are able to reach all parts of the statue, including the exterior of the face, with help of magnetic-climbing systems which include a special pair of shoes as well as hand grips, especially meant for climbing metal surfaces and tall structures. No special chemicals are being used to clean the statue, as this activity is primarily undertaken to only clean the surface of dirt, blemish and bird droppings,” he said.
Apart from the dust that may have settled in the crevices of the labels put together as the exterior facade of the statue, the authorities are aware that many parts of the statue’s bronze cladding are beginning to turn green, owing to its natural property of oxidation. Top officials of SSNNL said that the design teams had also prepared a projection of how the statue’s look would change over the years, as the bronze completes its process of natural oxidation to form patina — the green-ish tarnish which also lends the sturdy metal its artistic feel.
“Just like the Statue of Liberty in the US, which is made of copper and has turned into the present day green-ish colour that it is now recognised by, the Statue of Unity will also change its colour over the years. The bronze, which mainly consists of copper as part of its alloy composition, reacts with the atmosphere as a natural process and tarnishes over time. For many statues across the world, this tarnish actually lends depth to the art. We have estimated that the statue will turn green-ish over the next few decades,” Vyas added.
Another top official said that the design teams have estimated that the SoU will eventually turn a distinctive grey, which will also “add to its artistic attraction”."

Three days ahead of the event where Modi is expected to launch the campaign to collect iron from farmers to build the Rs 2,500 crore memorial for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,the state government sent its emissary,tribal development minister Ganpat Vasava,to announce that it would not only repeal the Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) under which the government was to acquire land for tourism development around the statue,but also promised to form the Garudeshwar taluka. Modi is expected to formally announce the taluka on October 31.
Vasava told media persons,in the presence of local villagers at Kevadia Colony,that the government had agreed to most of the demands made by the tribals. The government has accepted the demand to form Garudeshwar taluka after a long and extensive meeting with the Chief Minister at his residence on Saturday. The chief secretary and the revenue department officials have been given instruction for the same. Also,with the formation of the new taluka,the KADA will be automatically repealed, Vasava said. The government has not offered anything in writing yet. 
The tribals had held a protest on October 2 after KADA officials approached panchayats of 70 villages,seeking their consent for acquiring land for tourism purpose. A delegation from the protesters met the Cabinet core committee on October 15 to express their unhappiness over the land acquisition decision. Back then,the delegation,calling itself “Satter Gaam Aadivasi Sangathan (Association of 70 tribal villages),did not call the meet fruitful. The villagers had given a 15-day deadline.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The first phase of what is pitched as the world’s tallest statue is planned to be completed in 42 months. The project includes the Sardar Patel statue,a bridge over the river connecting the statue with the main road and a road till Kevadia. The Sadhu Tekri,where the statue is planned,will have a memorial garden and lifts to carry visitors to the top of the statue from where they can view the dam from the eyes of the statue. The total height of the structure,including the pedestal level,will stretch to 240 metres,an engineer associated with the project said. 
Vasava said the government has also accepted revising compensation packages for six villages from where land was acquired for the creation of the Narmada dam in 1960,but was used for other purposes after the plan for the dam site changed. The villagers were demanding that they be offered similar compensation for the dam that has been offered to villages that were submerged due to the dam. They will now get a special package.
The land presently houses Narmada Nihar hotel run by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL),an SRP campus,a private school,all given on lease by the government. Some part of the land has also been leased for stone quarrying purpose.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Social activist Rohit Prajapati,one of the leaders of the protest,said,”People are not opposing KADA for the sake of KADA. We are opposing the acquisition of land for tourism development in the region. The government has not assured that no such development will take place in the region. They have made a vague declaration just because of the CM’s visit on October 31.”"

(ANI)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday urged civil service officials not to think of the administrative services as a career, but as a service for the poor. Referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s principle that any service should reach the last man standing, Modi urged officers to be “proactive and progressive”.
He was addressing a gathering of probationary civil services officers who had undergone a joint conference titled ‘Aarambh’ in Gujarat’s Kevadia for over a week. The Prime Minister was visiting Kevadia as part of the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas or National Unity Day celebrations.
With the Statue of Unity — the giant statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel which also features in the logo of ‘Aarambh’, in the backdrop — Modi described the training conference as a “unique, integrated” course that brings together all civil services officers.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“So far, we have seen that some officers train in Mussoorie, some in Hyderabad. This is the first time that you all have gathered in an integrated programme and been exposed to similar experts from the field of economics, administration and other important fields. This is truly the beginning of an integrated programme for the administrative services,” the Prime Minister said.
The video of his speech was put out by the BJP on its social media handle. Modi exhorted the probationary officers not to view the civil services as a career but draw inspiration from the works of Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi to ensure development in their respective areas.
“You must come into this system thinking of it as your service to the people. It is important to ensure that people do not think of you as officers sitting behind closed doors. Interacting with people and hearing them is extremely important. No one expects you to have an instant solution to problems but it is important to step into the field and check up on areas,” he said, quoting the example of Sardar Patel’s transformation of the Ahmedabad Municipality.
He also advised officials to follow Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of ‘antyodaya’.
“We must remember what Gandhi ji has said, that ‘any benefit given to the society must truly reach the last of the people’. You must always weigh each of your decisions on two parameters — whether it meets the aspirations and hopes of those people on the last rungs of society, and whether it meets the principles of unity and the sovereignty of the country. Your signatures can make a lot of difference on paper,” he said.
Emphasising on the need to reach out to people, Modi also laid importance on clearing the image of the bureaucracy as being “unapproachable”."

Nearly 200 people, mostly tribals, were detained by police in Narmada and parts of south Gujarat on Wednesday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya Colony on Wednesday.
Several tribal villages located near the statue, and tribal activists and politicians had earlier announced to hold protest on October 13, alleging that the government had failed to look into the welfare of the tribal communities in the area affected by the construction of Narmada dam and the 182-metre-tall statue.
In Surat district, 57 protesters, a majority of them (52) Bhilistan Tiger Sena (BTS) members and leaders, were detained and later released.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“There has been no untoward incident in Surat district. While protesters came out on roads and at public places, we acted swiftly and detained them,” Deputy Superintendent of Police (Surat Rural) Hetal Patel said.
Over 60 protesters, including 30 members of the BTS, were detained from various talukas of Narmada district while they were on their way to Kevadiya Colony wearing black headgears and with black balloons. All those detained were later released by the police after the inauguration event came to an end.
Taking note of the protest call given by BTS and tribal leader Chhotu Vasava, police were on alert and deployed at sensitive locations across the region.
At Songadh town in Tapi district, youths tried to take out rally from the main market area without police permission in the morning. Police detained 23 of them immediately after they began chanting slogans against the state government. They were release in the evening.
“Apart from Songadh, protesters came out on roads at Dolvan, Uchhal, Vyara towns in Tapi district. Our police detained a total of 45 youths from different towns in the district under sections 68 and 69 of the Gujarat Police Act. They were later released. Not a single untoward incident took place in the district. A majority of the detainee were members of the Bhilistan Tiger Sena,” Tapi district Superintendent of Police V V Chaudhary said.

However the protest was not only limited to Tapi district, tribals youths also protested in Valsad, Navsari, and Bharuch districts, asking shopkeepers to observe bandh. Police detained 18 protesters in Bharuch district, 15 on Valsad district, and three in Navsari district.
Dang was the only district in south Gujarat where there was no report of any protest by tribals. “There was no protest in our district which has hundred per cent tribal population. The reason is that there is no cadre of Bhilistan Tiger Sena in our district,” Dang Superintendent of Police Shweta Shrimali said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

(File/Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)
Home Minister Rajnath Singh Thursday hit out at separatists in Jammu and Kashmir, saying they exploit every possible situation to fan anti-India sentiments and incite the people.
Inaugurating the annual conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police at the site of the tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat, the home minister said the Pakistan establishment is seeking to forge an alliance between the Sikh extremist groups, their country’s Islamist outfits and Kashmir-focused terrorists to hurt Indian interests.
“The separatists exploit every possible situation to agitate the people, to fan anti-India sentiments which lead to law and order situations. Financing from across the border for militants and separatists is a cause of concern,” he said.

Singh said Pakistan has been perpetrating terrorist activities on Indian soil from Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab. The security situation in the hinterland and in Jammu and Kashmir continues to be vitiated even though stone pelting incidents have declined, he said. “Attempts by militants to infiltrate in large numbers, intermittent attacks and efforts at local recruitment continue. Terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK remains in the form of training camps, launching pads and communication control stations,” Singh said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The home minister asked the security establishment to check efforts to revive terrorism in Punjab. He said recent terror incidents in Punjab and related interdiction indicate concerted efforts on part of the Pakistan establishment and Sikh extremist elements based in Pakistan to revive terrorism in the border state with active support from Sikh radical and extremist entities based abroad, especially Europe and America.
“Pakistan establishment is seeking to forge an understanding between Sikh extremist groups and Pakistan-based Islamist outfits as well as Kashmir-centric terrorist groups for targeting Indian interests,” he said. Singh said terrorism in the hinterland has been stamped out and the law enforcement agencies, through concerted action coordinated by Intelligence Bureau, have managed to thwart the first tide of propaganda and mobilisation by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “Consequently, India witnessed very few incidents of IS-inspired violence. In concerted counter-terrorism operations, law enforcement agencies have arrested nearly 125 suspected terrorists this year as against 117 arrested in 2017,” he said.
He said the new phase of Islamic State propaganda emanating from Afghanistan-Pakistan region was being countered effectively.
The home minister said economic installations and iconic institutions are also being continuously targeted from across the western border through espionage and cyberspace. “Pakistan continues to abet terrorism and during the period January 1, 2017 to November 29, 2018, as many as 17 ISI-backed espionage modules have been neutralised in the country resulting in the arrest of 25 espionage agents which include two Pakistanis. “Various sensitive organisations, including the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, ITBP, DRDO, BSF, CRPF, MEA, Airport Authority of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Indian Railways, have been targeted by PIOs from across the border through spoofed/crank calls to elicit sensitive information,” he said.
The conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police is being held at the site of the tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat.
The 182-metre ‘Statue of Unity’ of Patel was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat’s Narmada district on October 31. Taller than the Statue of Liberty in the US, the Statue of Unity has been built on islet Sadhu Bet near the Sardar Sarovar Dam. The conference is an annual affair where senior police officials of the states and the Centre meet and discuss issues related to internal security, crimes and related challenges, another official said.
The Modi government has been organising this meeting outside the national capital since it came to power in 2014.

The last four conferences were held in Guwahati, Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, Hyderabad and Tekanpur in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior district.  The Statue of Unity was first conceptualised by Modi during his tenure as Gujarat chief minister. He had laid the foundation stone for it in 2013.
Patel, also India’s first deputy prime minister, was credited with merging of over 500 princely states into the Union of India."

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said radical elements based in “Europe and America” and backed by Pakistan are attempting to revive terror in Punjab.
Singh, who inaugurated the 53rd national annual conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police (DGPs and IGPs) here, stated that recent terror incidents in Punjab indicate “concerted efforts by the Pakistan establishment and Sikh extremist elements based in Pakistan to revive terrorism in Punjab”. This, he stated in a tweet, has “active support of radical entities based abroad, especially (in) Europe & America”.
The inaugural day of the three-day event focussed on discussions ranging from the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir, insurgency in the Northeast, Left Wing Extremism, and civil policing. The event is being held at the Statue of Unity site at Kevadiya, in Gujarat’s Narmada district.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Pointing out the success of law enforcement agencies in counter-terrorism operations, the Home Minister said nearly 125 suspected terrorist have been arrested so far this year, slightly more than 117 arrests last year. He also said law enforcement agencies had managed to overcome the first tide of propaganda and mobilisation by the Islamic State.
Lauding the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for its work in countering terror, Singh said 45 NIA special courts have been constituted across the country. He said the agency has registered 183 cases from its inception until December 2017. Of these, chargesheets have been filed in 135 cases, trial concluded in 37 cases, including 35 cases that have resulted in conviction. This, Singh pointed out, is one of the highest conviction rates by any agency in the world.
While the media was barred from the conference, Singh put out a series of tweets on discussions at the event. About the law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said the number of cases of stone-pelting have come down. “The separatists also exploit every possible situation to agitate people to fan further anti-India sentiments which leads to law and order situation. However, the stone pelting incidents have declined,” he tweeted.
On the Northeast, Singh stated that the region has undergone a steady improvement in recent years, with a 17-per cent decline in incidents of violence and 38-per cent reduction in civilian casualties.
Speaking on the “significance” of the venue of the conference, Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “had visualised and conceptualised the majestic, world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadia several years back and it was most appropriate to hold the national conference of police/security forces at the place as a tribute to Sardar Patel”, according to a release issued by the Gujarat government. Singh also launched an app of the All India Police Sports Control Board.
The top officers, many of whom came with their families, had been asked to bring a sapling each from their respective states, and the day began them visiting the Statue of Unity site and planting the saplings at the Valley of Flowers in the complex.
Singh, along with Ministers of State for Home Kiren Rijiju and Hansraj Ahir, reached Kevadiya Colony around 2 pm and inaugurated the conference.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be present at the conference on Friday and Saturday.
The nine sessions of the three-day conference will see discussions on issues such as militancy in J&K, radicalisation of youths, cross-border terrorism, the Maoist situation, the situation in the Northeast and communal clashes and communally sensitive news being circulated through social media.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Parliament House officials told The Indian Express that the statue would be placed at the main entrance of the new building, once it was complete.
A witness to history
If statues could record the goings-on before them, this 16-foot bronze statue of the Father of the Nation would be among the most valuable repositories of India’s contemporary history. The Mahatma, seated in lotus position, has been a mute witness to both intense, thought-provoking debates as well as cacophonies — uproarious protests and slogan shouting — in Parliament for close to three decades. And a large number of lawmakers have at one time or the other over the years stood or squatted at the statue in symbolic protest.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
It was in front of this statue that Rahul Gandhi held his first protest against the “frequent disruption” of Parliament by BJP MPs. The first pictures of Rahul as an active Lok Sabha member showed him — with Jyotiraditya Scindia, who is now with the BJP, to his right — and other young MPs like Jitin Prasada, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Sachin Pilot, and Ajay Maken, sitting in front of the Gandhi statue holding signs that said “Please Hear Us” and “We Also Want To Speak” during the 2005 Budget session.
The late TDP MP Naramalli Sivaprasad had photographers flocking to him every day during the Budget session of 2018 when he appeared before the statue in various get-ups — wearing a sari, dressed as Adolf Hitler, as a Christian priest, as Lord Krishna, as a maulvi, as Narada, etc.
During Parliament’s Monsoon session this year, held amidst the Covid pandemic, eight Rajya Sabha MPs including Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress and Rajiv Satav of the Congress, staged perhaps the first overnight sit-in protest at the statue, spreading sheets on the small lawn in front.
A reminder of values
MPs cutting across party lines say the statue holds enormous meaning for them.
Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said the statue represents the sense of gratitude the country has for the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to the world, his values and simplicity.
For the CPI’s D Raja, who served as MP for 12 years, the statue symbolises love and compassion for everyone, and non-violence — a message that no MP should ever forget.
Congress MP Hibi Eden, who entered Parliament for the first time in 2019, said the statue was never just a decorative piece. “It means a lot of values and principles we should look up to. Whenever there is injustice — against the people or when the Opposition is denied justice — we go in front of the statue which symbolises tolerance and non-violence.

The statue in front of which thousands of visitors to Parliament House pose for pictures, was unveiled on October 2, 1993 by then President Shankar Dayal Sharma. It was donated by the Urban Development Ministry, according to the Rajya Sabha website.
Some Parliament officials said the statue was not meant for the spot where it was ultimately installed, rather it was meant to be placed under the canopy at India Gate from where a statue of King George V had been removed in the mid-1960s. But it ended up at Parliament House after several leaders and Gandhians opposed the idea of placing the Mahatma on a pedestal vacated by the King of Britain.
A former senior official of Parliament recalled that the late socialist leader George Fernandes raised the matter in Parliament. “He accused the (Congress) government of leaving Gandhi in the middle of the road. So the government immediately made arrangements to bring the statue to Parliament, and place it in front of Gate No. 1,” the official said. Another official said there was also a plan to install the statue near Nirman Bhavan.

The sculptor and his creation
The statue was the creation of Ram V Sutar, now 95, who has also designed the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue, of Sardar Patel, in Gujarat. When Sutar was asked to design a statue for India Gate, he had made a small model of Mahatma Gandhi in meditative pose, recalled Anil Ram Sutar, Sutar’s son.
“There was a competition, and participants were asked to make a statue 2.5 feet high. Prime Minister Morarji Desai came to examine the entries when they were displayed at the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). He liked what my father made the best. He was so fascinated by it that he took it home to keep looking at it for a few days, and then returned it,” Anil Ram Sutar told The Indian Express. “Then Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister, and she too checked all the statues and liked my father’s creation the most,” he said.
Everyone was impressed by the “serenity and the peaceful expression” on the face of the Mahatma, Anil Ram Sutar said. There are two copies of the statue, he said — one is in Gujarat and the other is in Hyderabad. “There is also a similar statue, 27 feet high, for the Karnataka Vidhan Sabha,” he said.

(Express Photos)
After an initial scare by Congress, the story in Gujarat Assembly elections followed an expected path as BJP took the lead. According to NDTV, the saffron party, which has been in power in the western state for 22 years, was the frontrunner in 102 seats and Congress was shown to be leading in 78. At one point, both the parties were in neck and neck, raising hopes in the Congress camp.
The Election Commission data showed BJP had garnered 49 per cent of the vote share, up from the 47 percent in 2012. Congress, meanwhile, upped its vote share to 41.7 per cent from 39 per cent. In 2012 assembly elections, BJP had won 115 seats, while Congress got just 59.
The Patidars of Saurashtra region prima facie seems to have changed their allegiance as Congress was leading from a majority of 54 seats. In Morbi, the epicentre of the Patidar agitation seeking reservation that was spearheaded by PAAS convenor Hardik Patel, Congress candidates were leading from all the three assembly seats. Sitting BJP MLA from Morbi, Kantilal Amrutiya was trailing to his Congress challenger Brijesh Merja. Lalit Kagathara of Congress was ahead of his BJP rival Raghavji Gadara from Tankara seat. Sitting Congress MLA from Wankaner, Mahamadavid Pirzada was also leading his BJP challenger Jitu Somani.

Besides Morbi, Congress was leading in most of seats in Junagadh, Surendranagar, Gir Somnath, Kutch, Devbhumi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Porbandar and Botad. BJP, on the other hand, was ahead in Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar. Barring Porbandar and Devbhumi Dwarka and Porbandar, the rest of the districts have sizable Patidar population and quota leader Hardik Patel had exhorted his community members not to vote for the BJP this election.
“The mood of the people of Gujarat will lead Congress to victory. Can’t comment much on initial trends; let the final results come,” said state Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani registered a thumping victory over Congress’ Indranil Rajyaguru from Rajkot West constituency by 40,000 votes, while Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani was leading in Vadgam constituency by over 20,000 votes. Mevani is contesting the elections as an independent, with the support of Congress. Meanwhile, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, who joined the Congress just before the elections, has taken the lead in Radhanpur constituency, leading by 15,000 votes against BJP’s Solanki Thakor.

Meanwhile, Central Gujarat saw mixed results. The biggest upset for BJP came in the tribal district of Narmada as both sitting MLAs – Motisinh Vasava from Dediapada constituency and Shabdasharan Tadvi from Nandod constituency- were trailing behind the Congress-Bhartiya Tribal Party combine in the final round.
Rebel JD(U) leader Chhotubhai Vasava’s son Mahesh Vasava, who is contesting from Dediapada Assembly in Narmada district, won against BJPs’ sitting MLA Moti Vasava by 21,700 votes. In Nandod, Congress candidate Premsinh Vasava has a clear lead over sitting MLA Tadvi. Incidentally, Narmada district, which recorded the highest voter turn out in the polls at 79%, is home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project, the 182-metre-tall Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhai Patel. In Jhagadia (ST seat), Chhotu Vasava won by 48,600 votes.
In Vadodara, BJP candidates Seema Mohile from Akota, Manisha Vakil from Vadodara City, Jitendra Sukhadia from Sayajigunj, Rajendra Trivedi from Raopura and Yogesh Patel from Manjalpur constituencies registered comfortable victories. All the five urban seats have been traditional BJP bastions. In Vadodara rural, Waghodia BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav won by a margin of over 12,000 votes, while Karjan MLA Satish Patel scraped through. Ketan Inamdar, sitting MLA of Savli in Vadodara, also registered a thumping win, while Padra sitting MLA Dinesh Patel is set to face an upset from Congress candidate Jaspalsinh Thakor.

Exuding confidence as the leads showed a comfortable margin between the Congress and BJP, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, “Will form government in both Himachal and Gujarat with clear majority.” BJP deputy CM Nitinbhai Patel, who is presently leading in Mahesana by a thread, said BJP would ultimately register victory. “Ultimately BJP is going to register victory, contrary to early trends BJP is leading almost everywhere now,” Patel said.
In Kapadvanj seat of Kheda district, which was represented by Shankarsinh Vaghela, Congress candidate Kalu Dabhi has maintained a steady lead over BJP candidate Kanu Dabhi and strong independent Bimal Shah, who is a former BJP cabinet minister.
Almost all exit polls have predicted more than 100 seats for the BJP in Gujarat. According to News 24, which got most of its predictions right in the past, BJP is expected to win 135 seats in Gujarat and Congress is likely to bag 47 seats. Held in two phases, the voter turnout this time was 68.40 per cent, much lower than the 71.32 per cent recorded in 2012 assembly elections.
The BJP’s entire campaign this election has revolved around Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Centre’s policies such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax.
This election has been unlike any witnessed in Gujarat in recent times. For one, this is the first election since Modi moved to Delhi as Prime Minister and the Congress had sensed an outside chance at pulling off an upset victory. Rahul Gandhi, who toured the state in four phases as part of his 12-day Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra, was appointed party president less than 48 hours before the results was announced."

Congress’ social media head Divya Spandana tweeted a controversial comment along with a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi standing next to Sardar Patel’s ‘Statue of Unity’, evoking a sharp reaction from the BJP which slammed it as the “language of arrogance”. Spandana tweeted a picture of Modi standing next to Sardar Patel’s 182-metre-tall statue in Gujarat, which was unveiled on Wednesday, with the comment: “Is that bird dropping?”

Asked about the tweet, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra hit out at the opposition party, alleging that “this is the real culture” of the Congress party. They miss no opportunity to abuse the prime minister of India, he said. “It is the same party which called the prime minister ‘neech’. Shashi Tharoor called him a scorpion and now Divya Spandana says that he is a bird’s dropping,” Patra said.
“This is nothing but language of arrogance from the Congress party for the normal Indian who with his sheer hardwork become the prime minister of the country,” he said. A normal Indian appears bird’s dropping to them, while a dynast is power centre for them, Patra said. “This is arrogance of dynasty which is abusing the democracy of India,” he alleged.
Despite criticism from the ruling party and Twitterati, Spandana remained defiant. “When you’re done huffing & puffing take a breath & hold a mirror to yourselves. My views are mine. I don’t give two hoots about yours. I’m not going to clarify what I meant and what I didn’t cos you don’t deserve one,” she tweeted."

Bhupendra Rana
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Sadhu Bet after inaugurating the Sardar Sarovar dam on Sunday to review the progress of his pet project, the 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. This will be Modi’s first visit to the Statue of Unity site after assuming office the office of Prime Minister in 2014. Officials confirmed that Modi will view a presentation on the various stages of the project, including the bronze cladding of the outer facade of the statue.
Officials of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL), which is executing the project, said that so far, the engineering teams have erected about 104 metre, which will form the statue’s waist.
At the off-site workshop, located a few kilometres away, workers from TQ Art Foundry, belonging to Chinese firm Jiangxi Tongqing Company, are assisting the L&T workers in assembling the bronze cladding of the facade.

On Saturday, a day ahead of PM’s visit, workers put in additional hours to compensate for the day off on Sunday.

SSNNL officials confirmed that the bronze cladding has arrived from China and will soon also make its way to the actual construction site.
“The bronze pieces from China have to be assembled into panels and tagged to fit into the right places on the statue on site. The work is being done by L&T, and the pieces have arrived from China,” S S Rathod, MD of the SSNNL, told The Sunday Express."

The PM will inaugurate several peripheral tourist attractions around the SoU, including a jetty service and the water aerodrome connecting Kevadia to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad, along with addressing trainee officers of civil services at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Adminis-tration (LBSNAA) from SoU.
The 182-metre statue, which opened for the public on October 17 after the Covid-19 lockdown, will be temporarily closed as the administration prepares the stage for Modi’s address via video-conferencing.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Nilesh Dubey, Deputy Collector, Kevadia, and Chief Administrator of Statue of Unity, said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Kevadia on October 31 to mark the Rashtriya Ekta Divas, which is now as important as the Republic Day or Independence Day. The statue will be closed to public for five days as we are preparing the stage for PM’s floral tributes at the statue as well as to prepare for the video-conferencing address from the exhibition hall of the Statue of Unity. We need to make necessary arrangements… So we do not want visitors at that time.”
A senior official of the district administration said that Modi is expected to make a night halt at Kevadia but the final itinerary is in the works. A senior official said, “The tentative itinerary receiver from the Prime Minister’s office has clarified that a night halt is on cards to inaugurate the light show in Kevadia. He is expected to arrive in the on October 30 evening and join the Rashtriya Ekta Divas celebrations from early morning on October 31… A parade by police teams from across the country will be part of the event. While the Prime Minister will arrive in Kevadia by helicopter, he will return to Ahmedabad via the seaplane, which will be inaugurated on October 31.”
Modi is expected to inaugurate the children’s nutrition park, Kevadia Zoological Park and jungle safari, along with a jetty service downstream Narmada river from the SoU as well as the much-hyped water aerodrome service from Kevadia to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. The projects, except the water aerodrome, were originally slated for inauguration on March 26 but was postponed due to lockdown.
On October 31, 2019, Modi addressed a gathering of probationary civil services officers at the SoU, following a week-long “joint exposure” arranged for the trainees at the tent city in Kevadia Colony, titled ‘Aarambh’. Modi, who interacted with the officers in a closed meeting and also addressed them at their valedictory function, had urged the officials to work jointly and not think of the administrative services as “a career” but as a “service to the poor”."

Ad Guru Piyush Pandey, who recently visited the IIM Ahmedabad campus along with Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, to speak about the concept of Khushboo Gujarat Ki  turned on his witty side at the event. He said, “This is my debut at IIMA. I would never have made it here otherwise as I know I would not have been able to clear any entrance exam. Hence, I have made a back door entry here.” Pandey also mentioned how from knowing nothing about Gujarat, he now knows more about it than his home state Rajasthan!
Bachchan-speak
Noted Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan, during his recent interaction held at IIM-A in the city, spoke volumes about the Khushboo Gujarat Ki campaign that he is the face of. Speaking about his latest leg of the shoot of the tourism campaign at the Little Rann of Kutch, which houses a rare species of wild ass, the actor quipped, “I had  never even heard of the wild ass. I always thought it must be an cursive word, but found out it is a rare species of animal found in Kutch. I realised that it is actually a beautiful animal, unlike the term the word is associated with. Also it is a smart one. It knows which grass to eat, which grass contains water when growing in an arid zone.”

The maldhari community, which gave the Ahmedabad cyclothon its local traditional touch was missing this time. Clad in white attire and bright red turbans, riding their bicycles with the traditional bamboo stick, these people were particularly motivated to participate in the event last year. The reason, cited by officials who were responsible for their participation, was that some prior appointments and the cyclothon clashing with another major event organised on the same day deterred them from joining the event. Kits were being distributed in the villages and the city of Ahmedabad district to collect soil and iron for the Statue of Unity project and trucks dispatched for the destination were flagged off from Ahmedabad by Revenue Minister Anandi Patel. So, the cyclothon had to be pushed to the backseat by this community."

He is also seeking iron.
The Gujarat chief minister is building the tallest statue in the world for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,and his men will be launching a countrywide campaign with farmers soon to collect iron from their farming tools for it. With Modis ambitions shooting skyward,the statue will keep in step: for one,the designated height is 182 metres,the number of assembly seats in Gujarat; secondly,it is called the Statue of Unity,for the man credited with bringing in princely states to ensure India was a stable country; thirdly,it honours a leader from Gujarat on whom Modi openly models himself,and who is seen by some as having been unfairly denied prime ministership.
By getting farmers involved in this biggest ever project on any tribal land,he believes,he can establish a valuable emotional connect. Nearly 5,000 tonnes of steel will be needed for the Rs-2,000-crore project,titled Ek Bharat,Shresth Bharat. Videos are already circulating on the Net showing how it will be twice the height of New Yorks Statue of Liberty and five times that of Christ the Redeemer at Rio de Janeiro.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The Gujarat government,with the help of NGOs and village committees,will mobilise farmers to donate the iron pieces,which will be transported via post,or buses and trains.
Collection will be done at the district headquarters,from where iron pieces will go to regional centres. There will be around four such centres. Modi himself is likely to be present at these regional centres, said a government source.
Modi first announced the project on October 7,2010,at a press conference to mark the beginning of his 10th year as CM. However,since his elevation to a national role,both the statue and the project have got a revamp.
At the time of the announcement,videos concerning the project called it Gujarats tribute to the nation and showed a statue of the Sardar with his left arm folded. It also had a rare photograph of Patel holding the lotus (the BJPs symbol).
The second video,released on June 11 at an All-India Conference of Livestock and Dairy Development in Gandhinagar,saw changes. With farmers from 22 states,the video titled Ek Bharat,Shresth Bharat emphasised Patel as the son of a farmer. It also showed detailed clips of how he persuaded the royals of Kathiawar to cede to the Indian Union and formed the Saurashtra Sangh in 1947.
From Gujarats tribute in the first video,it starts calling the statue the nation paying tribute to the Iron Man,and details how farmers across villages in India will donate iron,which will be melted to be used on the memorial. The emphasis also shifts to 120 crore Indians. 
The statue is planned on Sadhu Bet,an island facing the Sardar Sarovar dam in the tribal Narmada district.
The Indian arm of Turner Project Management  which worked on the worlds tallest building,the Burj Khalifa of Dubai  is one of the firms roped in for this project. Also part of the consortium are US-based Michael Graves and Associates Inc and German firm Meinhardt India Private Limited. 
Modi himself chairs the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust that is executing it. The member secretary is K Srinivas,secretary of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.
The bidding process will begin on July 15 and the iron-collection drive on October 31,the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. It will go on till January 26,2014. The project is scheduled to be completed in 42 months.
However,not all the iron pieces donated by farmers will be used to build the main statue. Quality is an important factor. These will be sorted. The pieces not fit for the main statue will be used in other structures within the complex, said an official. If more iron is needed,it will be procured from the Steel Authority of India. 
Senior BJP leaders believe that the grand project will keep attention of the rest of India focused on Gujarat  and Modi. The collection of iron pieces from farmers will help Modi reach out to farmers in all the villages of India, said a top-level leader.
The secretary of the Gujarat unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh,Praful Senjalia,said farmers would be happy participating in the social cause."

Opposition Congress staged a walkout from the Gujarat Assembly on Thursday after a Private Member’s Bill, introduced by its MLA Naushad Solanki, was rejected by the majority.
Solanki had introduced the Bill The Gujarat Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) (Planning, Allocation and Utilization of Financial Resources) Bill, 2018 — seeking to put in place an institutional mechanism to ensure that the funds meant for Scheduled Castes (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities are exclusively used for their welfare.
While moving the Bill, Solanki said that despite a number of welfare schemes, the two communities have not developed as much as they should have. He said that it is because the funds meant for the two communities under SCSP and TSP are diverted to other projects of the state government. Giving examples, Solanki said that the funds from SCSP and TSP are being used for other projects such as a film on the Statue of Unity, ‘Garib Kalyan Mela’, buying wheat at minimum support price, World Environment Day celebration, Mega Job Fair, Gujarat Foundation Day celebration, construction of roads, etc.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Solanki added that there is no monitoring of where the funds from SCSP and TSP are being utilised. If the funds from SCSP and TSP are exclusively used for the welfare of SC and ST communities, the two will be developed in the next 10 years, he remarked.
Asking all members of the House to rise above party lines and support the Bill, Solanki also said that five states of India have already passed similar Bills in their respective states and Gujarat should follow them.
The Bill was supported by Congress MLA P D Vasava and independent MLA Jignesh Mevani. On the other hand, BJP MLAs Hitu Kanodiya, Naresh Patel and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Ishvar Parmar opposed it.
Opposing the Bill, Kanodiya – an SC MLA – said that the SC and ST communities have prospered under the BJP government, adding that the literacy rate of Dalits in Gujarat has considerably increased. Naresh Patel also opposed the Bill and said that the BJP government was not wasting a single penny and has been providing facilities of health, education, roads, etc. apart from giving them respect. Vasava, a tribal MLA, said that the tribal community has not been getting the budget allocation in proportion to its population which is widening the gap of inequality.
Mevani strongly supported the Bill and had a brief heated argument with Kanodiya over the issue. He even dared Kanodiya to fight and win an election from a non-reserved seat to “realise the meaning of reservation and what it means to be a Dalit or tribal in this country”.
Parmar opposed the Bill and said that the BJP government has been providing enough funds for the welfare of the SC/ST communities and that there was no need for a separate law. He said that the state is designing area-based schemes and not caste-based schemes, and there is no reason why the two communities are deprived from the benefits of it.
He also said that the developmental expenditure of the Gujarat government for 2019-’20 is more than the population of the SC/ST communities. Parmar added that the literacy rate of the SC community is Gujarat is much higher than the national literacy rate of India.
After this discussion, Speaker Rajendra Trivedi put the Bill for voice vote after Solanki refused to withdraw the same and it was rejected by majority vote.
Dissatisfied with this, Naushad Solanki challenged the Speaker’s decision on voice vote and demanded the division of votes (formal voting) under the rules of the Gujarat Assembly. However, this demand was rejected by the Speaker.
Following this, several Congress MLAs and Jignesh Mevani protested and rushed to the Well of the House and raised slogans against the BJP government. Eventually, the Congress MLAs staged a walk out."

International Yoga Day witnessed widespread public participation in Gujarat with more than 1.25 crore people attending the event at  various locations
Ahmedabad

In Ahmedabad alone nearly six lakh participants joined at over 700 various locations, including 100 public gardens and parks. “At the main event at GMDC ground, out of a mass gathering of 75,000 people, over 60,000 were participants. Among these, nearly 25,000 were students of city schools and colleges, some 5,000 representatives from Patanjali Yogpeeth, some 8,000 from Art of Living, 5,000 from Brahma Kumaris and over 5,000 individual participations,” said Ahmedabad collector Rajkumar Beniwal.
“The city saw a participation of nearly 5.5 to 6 lakh residents. Apart from individual events, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had organised the event at nearly 230 places and over 300 schools. City’s new West zone alone had over 70 venues. There must be a total of 700 venues in Ahmedabad where the event was celebrated,” said AMC commissioner D Thara.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The administration had also arranged vehicles to help participants travel to the main event from various parts of city. “While individual participants reached on their own, there were arrangements of buses too for groups and organisations,” said Beniwal.

The municipal and private schools and colleges actively participated in the event. More than 4,000 master trainers were trained who further trained hundreds of participants. National Cadets Corps cadets too joined at the GMDC ground.
Vadodara

The 33-minute yoga session was organised at 14 locations in the city by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The event began at around 6.45am. Instructions beaming on LED screens at most venue, and trained professionals helped participants perform the aasans.
At Sama Indoor Sports Complex, Cabinet minister Saurabh Patel joined MP Ranjan Bhatt, MLAs Yogesh Patel, Jitendra Sukhadia, Rajendra Trivedi and Manisha Vakil, mayor Bharat Shah, district collector Avantika Aulakh, other officials and school students for the yoga session. Though turnout of locals was not as per the expectation, the city atithigruhs saw a decent flow of regular yoga followers.
Yoga sessions were also held by the BJP unit at Swaminaryan temple in Karelibaug, while the Army held an event at its military station in Makarpura. An event was also held for the inmates of the Vadodara central Jail in the morning, with a trainer helping the undertrials and convicts perform the aasans.
Amid resonating sound of Sanskrit shlokas at the sports complex, a group of Congress workers protested the use of the venue for “government functions”. The Congress activists demanded the public sports complex, inaugurated by CM Anandiben Patel last July, should be thrown open to people. The group was detained by police to end the ruckus.
Bharuch

Yoga professionals and fishermen performed the aasans on a few hundred fishing trawlers in Narmada near the Golden Bridge. Close to 1,500 people performed yoga for around 33 minutes. A participant, Asha Patel, said, “When I learnt about the opportunity to perform yoga on a boat, I was thrilled… It was very different from performing yoga on the ground. It was unsteady, but we tried to perform all the asanas perfectly”. Some participants said that a few stretching exercises that require shifting of body balance could not be performed on the smaller trawlers. A team of NDRF was deployed on patrol duty around the floating platform. Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Mansukh Vasava inaugurated the session with Gujarat cabinet minister Chhatrasinh Mori.
Narmada

Officials of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) chose the scenic backdrop of cloud covered lush green Satpura range, parallel to the upcoming Statue of Unity site at Sadhu Bet hillock for their yoga session on Sunday. The process to flatten the tip of the hillock of Sadhu Bet has begun in order to set base for the foundation of the 182-metre world’s tallest Statue of Unity. Officials said some local residents from Kevadia also joined their small group.
Rajkot

Cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Mohan Kundariya led around six lakh people in yoga sessions, held across 1,284 locations simultaneously in the district. The main event was held at Race Course ground. “Yoga is very helpful and therefore, I attended the session with my family today. I practice yoga daily. It keeps body fit and helps not just in concentration, but also balance of mind. This helps me a lot in my batting,” Pujara told The Indian Express. He joined the session with his father Aravind Pujara and wife Puja.
Gujarat Water Supply Minister Vijay Rupani, Rajkot Rural MLA Bhanuben Babaria, mayor Rakshaben Boliya, district collector Manisha Chandra and municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra were among those in attendance dominated by students and NCC cadets. Members of spiritual group, Art of Living also participated in big numbers.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

The idea of India is unity in diversity. Nations erect statues to symbolise what they stand for. “Send (the) homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door,” reads the inscription on the Statue of Liberty — the lady with the torch. India has erected a Statue of Unity, in Sardar Patel’s image, twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty.
India’s democratic and secular Constitution provides a homeland to citizens of a larger number of religions and races and speaking a greater variety of languages than citizens of any other country. Whereas tall statues are feats of engineering that can be completed in a few years, nation-building is a complex process which takes decades — even centuries. But it can be shaken in a moment. The foundation of the idea of India — of unity in diversity — has been severely shaken by the Citizenship Amendment Act and fear of a National Register of Citizens.
The ruling party’s leaders say they are implementing Sardar Patel’s vision of a unified India, whose statue, the tallest in the world, they have built. They seem to have lost sight of another statue, less grand than their Statue of Unity but more evocative, which is a better description of India’s journey to build an inclusive nation. This one, on Delhi’s Mother Teresa Crescent, shows Mahatma Gandhi leading a line of diverse Indians — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and others — to peacefully claim their freedom from a foreign empire.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In this, the 150th anniversary year of Gandhiji’s, it behooves our leaders to recall the vision of India that inspired the birth of our free country 72 years ago. It was a grand vision of unity in diversity that inspired the world too. Gandhiji invited students and citizens to study all religions with him in the Bible Room of the Gujarat Vidyapeeth. Where, along with words from many scriptures, his own words are inscribed: “I do not want my house to be walled in and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible.”
Globally, the vision of one world is cracking. International cooperation in trade and climate is failing. Walls are rising within countries between people with different visions of what a good society is. The world is being “broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls” as Tagore had feared. Social media, which was expected to bring people together, is perversely driving them apart into conceptually gated communities of people who think alike. They do not listen any more to people not like themselves.
Citizens in democracies have a right — and a responsibility — to speak up. The prime minister reminds them of their responsibilities, gliding over their rights. Protests have erupted on social media and on the streets against the divisive actions of India’s government. A chief minister dares to declare “revenge” against protestors in a democracy. State power has been used to unjustly seize their property. This is “maximum government, minimum governance” at its worst.
Seven years back, India’s citizens had risen up en masse against corruption and violence against women. A chain of coffee cafes had invited people to come in. “Stand up for this! Stand up for that! Let’s sit down and talk, yaar!”, its advertisements said. The government’s leaders should have listened to India’s citizens much better before taking actions that are provoking protests.
Can India become a beacon of unity in diversity as it once was? It will have to heal itself before it can throw light on others. Indians will have to learn to listen to each other calmly, to hear others’ points-of-views, to know others’ fears and hopes, and to respect and celebrate the differences amongst themselves.
Listening deeply to others, especially to those not like ourselves, will tone up the health of our society and our nation. We must learn to listen to why someone has a different point-of-view, and to learn who this different person is — not our stereotype of him or her, judged by the clothes they wear. Sadly, our public discourse, on electronic and social media, and even in our elected assemblies, has degenerated into squabbles about who to blame, rather than a discovery of what “We” — together — want.
Listening, like breathing, is a very simple action. Children learn to breathe and to listen soon after they are born. Then, growing up, humans seem to forget the values of breathing and listening. Yoga teaches us how to breathe well again. By simply breathing deeply and well, the health of our complex bodies and minds is improved. Yoga as a means for personal well-being is India’s gift to the world. It is celebrated as the UN International Yoga Day.
To achieve our vision of unity in diversity, let us switch off our smartphones and stop tweeting and insulting each other for just one day. Let us reach out to a citizen of our country who is “not like us”. Let’s listen to who she or he really is. Let’s start a national listening movement. And lead the world to an International Listening Day.

Addressing the video conference, Modi said, “In the history of Indian Railways, for the first time, so many trains from various corners of the country have been flagged off for one place. After all, Kevadiya is a place that has its identity with someone who has united the country and given the message of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. Today’s function resonates the vision of the Indian Railways and the mission of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Among the eight trains, one is also arriving from MG Ramachandran Central Railway Station in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and it’s a pleasant coincidence that today is the birth anniversary of MGR, a leader who ruled over the hearts of the people, whether he was in films or politics. To commemorate the life and efforts of MGR, we have recently changed the name of Chennai Central Railway Station to MGR Central RS. I am also delighted that so many representatives from different states are attending the function.”
The eight trains are Kevadiya-Varanasi (Mahamana Weekly Express), Kevadiya-Dadar (Dadar Kevadiya Daily Express), Kevadiya-Ahmedabad (Janshatabdi Daily Express), Kevadiya-Hazrat Nizamuddin (Nizamuddin Kevadia Sampark Kranti Bi Weekly Express), Kevadiya-Rewa (Kevadia Rewa Weekly Express), Kevadiya-Chennai (Chennai Kevadiya Weekly Express), Kevadiya-Pratapnagar (MEMU Daily) and Pratapnagar-Kevadiya (MEMU Daily).https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

At the event, Modi said that rail connectivity to Kevadiya will not only provide comfort to tourists but also benefit the local Adivasi population of Kevadiya town. He also spoke about Kevadiya being developed as a world-class family tourist destination.
“The rail connectivity will not only bring comfort to the tourists but also change the lives of the Adivasi people of Kevadiya as it will create opportunities of employment and self employment. The rail lines will also connect to places such as Karnali Ghat, Poicha and Garudeshwar near Narmada and the entire area is filled with spiritual vibration. Today, the number of visitors coming to watch the Statue of Unity has surpassed even those visiting the Statue of Liberty in the US and as many as 50 lakh (5 million) have already visited it after its inauguration. After the corona lockdown, we are having more and more visitors and according to a survey, it has been estimated that as connectivity is increasing, one lakh people are expected to arrive in Kevadiya every day. Today, Kevadiya has emerged as an example of how both development of ecology and economy can be done in a planned manner. Earlier, people were skeptical about Kevadiya being developed as a family tourist destination spot. They used to say that it will take decades to achieve the goal as there were no broad roads, enough street lights, rail connectivity, proper accommodation for tourists. Kevadiya was like any other village of India but in the past few years, a complete transformation has happened. Today, we have world-class facilities including mobile connectivity, seaplane service, good hospitals, street lights and broad roads. The town is a complete package for young, adult and old people and the Adivasi youth are also getting employment as a result of increasing tourism with their lives being touched with modernization and comfort. We see some people have become hotel managers, some have become guides and some have opened cafes in the area. We are also developing a Tribal Art gallery and a viewing gallery at the Kevadiya Railway Station from where visitors can see the Statue of Unity,” said Modi.

Modi also spoke about the efforts of the Indian Railways in the field of technological advancements.
“The Indian Railways apart from being a conventional medium for travel and transportation of goods is now connecting to places of tourism and spiritual importance. In the past few years, unprecedented work has been done towards technological advancements in the Indian Railways. Since our independence, most of our energy has been spent on improving the existing railway system as less focus was on new thinking, innovation and technology at that time. It was extremely important to change this approach and that’s why, in the past years there has been work to overhaul the railway system. The Kevadiya rail connectivity is an example as it was completed in record time despite obstacles. Similarly, dedicated freight corridor is also an example. From 2006 to 2014, work was done only on paper in the dedicated freight corridor project and not a single kilometre of track was laid. However since 2014, 1100 km track is going to be completed. Today, with the modernisation of rail network, such places in the country are being connected to rails, which wasn’t the case earlier. Old railway tracks are being electrified and it is due to these efforts that it is possible to run semi-high speed trains in India today. Had we not made high horse power electronic automotive, then we would have not been able to run double straight long hold container trains in India. A major reason behind fast paced modernization of Indian Railways is our focus on Atma Nirbharta (self independent) on rail manufacturing and rail technology. For that purpose, we need highly skilled specialized manpower and professionals in this sector and setting up of a rail university in Vadodara is a step in that direction,” said Modi.
The event was also attended by Railway Union Minister Piyush Goyal, Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani along with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan and others who attended the event via video conferencing."

(Express)
Barely five months after Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani inaugurated the country’s first Dinosaur Museum at Raiyoli village of Mahisagar district, said to be the “world’s third-largest dinosaur fossil site”, the museum is already a picture of neglect.
While the basement of the museum where life-size statues of dinosaurs are placed has been inundated for close to three weeks, the dysfunctional air-conditioning in the movie hall prevents the screening of an informative five-minute 3D film.
Officials contracted by the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited (TCGL) said the museum, which was constructed in 2007 but was opened only after an 12-year delay, has been visited by over 25,000 tourists since its inauguration in June this year.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png


	ExplainedWasted potential: lack of planning and monitoring

In 2016, the museum was renovated to add 3D film screening technology and virtual reality facilities after a 2016 report of the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) criticised the government of Gujarat and the tourism department for neglecting the museum after investing Rs 8.58 crore in it. About 50 dinosaur models, including a life-size one of Rajasaurus Narmadensis (a species whose fossil was excavated from Gujarat and is named after the Narmada river, where it is thought to have lived) are the Museum’s attractions.
Mamlatdar Vijaya Vala, who is part of the museum’s management committee, said the basement got flooded due to a design flaw. “The problem is there were heavy rains in this area this year, because of which the water table has increased by a great extent,” Vala told this newspaper. “Since the building is old and was constructed by the Tourism Corporation in 2007, at that time they did not undertake concreting of the basement. Now the water from the ground is repeatedly flooding the basement even after we continue to drain it out.” The basement was meant to be a selfie point for tourists with the dinosaurs models.
The sprawling movie hall, which can hold 60 tourists and is fitted with three split air conditioners, gets stuffy because the cooling equipment get overheated. As many as 100 tourists cram into the room most of the time, a staffer on duty, who did not wish to be identified, said, blaming it on ineffective management. Last week, agitated visitors created a ruckus after the faulty air conditioning led to a malfunction in the movie screening and a suffocation scare, the staffer added. The toilets at the museum are also unclean and in a shambles.
TGCL MD Jenu Devan told this newspaper that the department was aware of the problems and was working towards revamping the museum.
“Yes, we have experienced some problems now that the building is being used. It was constructed years ago and was lying vacant,” Devan said. “We have planned to issue tenders and carry out repairs and renovation of the existing building as well as to construct an extension for housing more interesting attractions.”
He said they realised that not only is the flooding of the basement an issue, but that the museum is right now not equipped to handle tourists in summers either. “We need a better air conditioning system. The extension building will have details on the extinction theory of the dinosaurs and also a 5D experience for patrons. We have set a deadline of 18-24 months to build it.”
A collection of dinosaur bones and egg hatcheries, with around 100 eggs, was discovered by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in 1981-82 in Raiyoli village in Balasinor taluka of Kheda district. The GSI then conducted a thorough excavation in 1991 and unearthed fossils of both herbivorous as well as carnivorous dino- saurs there. Dinosaur fossils have also been discovered in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. Balasinor royal scion Aaliya Sultana Babi has been advocating for the preservation of the Dinosaur Fossil Park since 1991, which has now come to be known across the world as the Jurassic Park of India.
Retired GSI Deputy Director and Paleontologist Dr Dhananjay Mohabey, who was among the team of palaeontologists to
discover dinosaur fossils in Raiyoli, about 200km from Kevadia way back 1991, said, “It was only in the year 2000 that we named the Rajasaurus Narmadensis, as we had found skeletal traces of a crown like presence on its skull. So, it was called a ‘Raja’,” Mohabey said.
“At the same time, we also found another dinosaur and it was named Rahiolisauras after the old spelling of the village Raiyoli. Both the Rajasauras and Rahiolisauras were carnivores. There was also another species of herbivore found along with them in Gujarat. Professors and Paleo-ntologists from the universities of Chicago and Michigan had joined us to study the treasures the GSI discovered almost accidentally in the 1980s,” he added."

Now,BJP leaders are set to tour every village in the state and collect soil and iron for the construction of the statue.
Heading a Gujarat government delegation,Trivedi said: “Though it is a government project and does not need individual contributions,but the whole idea is to involve farmers,students,social activists and patriotic citizens symbolically and get their endorsement to the project.”
“We will approach farmers to donate just a small piece of iron from their agriculture implements and a little bit of soil and send it in a kit with signatures of all villagers. This is a three-tier campaign,started by the Modi,to implement the project,” she told mediapersons.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Jairam Thakur,a former minister and sitting MLA – who is coordinator for Himachal Pradesh – said the drive to collect iron and soil from the state will begin on December 15. As many as 565 towns in India will witness a run for unity and Shimla will be one of the venues.
“We have several religious shrines and temples,beside dev sathans,which will also be part of the drive to collect soil for the statue,” Thakur added. The construction is estimated to cost Rs 2,500 crore and will be completed in four years.
Asked whether the absence of Narendra Modi from the Gujarat is affecting the government’s functioning,Trivedi said: “Not at all. Come and see yourself. Modi is not absent from Gujarat and the state still remains a model of good governance and development.”"

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, of which India is a member, organised a Eurasian Economic Forum in Xi’an city of China on Tuesday, pushing for greater cooperation in the spheres of communication, technology and development.
India did not register its presence at the Eurasian Economic Forum, with sources in the Indian government telling The Indian Express, “There was no participation. The organisers have been conveyed the reasons as well.” A diplomat from the Chinese side said that they had made attempts to reach out to India, but had received no response. “The entire event is foreshadowed by the Belt and Road Initiative. With India’s position on it, their lack of attendance is not surprising.”
Vladimir Smolov, the Secretary General of the SCO said in his keynote address,” It is a great honor for me to take part in the Forum in Xi’an, which is called upon to promote the revival of the ancient Great Silk Road in Eurasia in a new, modern format. As everyone knows, it was from here, from the ancient city of Changan, that the Great Silk Road began. Today, the situation in the world economy, despite positive developments, remains unstable, the process of economic globalisation is faced with the growth of unilateral protectionist measures and other challenges in international trade. In this broad international context, the Eurasian Economic Forum over the past years has become an important platform for finding new breakthrough development models and expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
He said that experts agree that the Eurasian macro economic region will become a powerful locomotive of the global economy. “The SCO countries, being at the epicenter of this region, consider improving the architecture of global economic governance and the consistent strengthening of the multilateral trading system based on the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) among their main priorities,” he said.
He added, the majority of leaders state that, “The comprehensive interaction within the framework of the large-scale initiative of the President of China Xi Jinping, “One Belt, One Road”, is called upon to unite the efforts of the states of the three continents in ensuring stable and sustainable development.”
There were multiple forums during the day including economics and tourism. At the tourism panel speakers pushed the idea of the SCO member states “Eight Wonders Exhibition Tour”, with one historical monument or place corresponding to each member country being represented on the pamphlet. While for Kazakhstan it was the Petroglyphs of Tamgaly, for China it was the Daming Palace of the Tang dynasty, built in AD 634. For India, the monument chosen was the 182 metre Statue Of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, inaugurated on October 31, 2018.

Over three months after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath checked the initial presentation for the construction of “Ram Statue” in Ayodhya on the lines of Statue of Unity in Gujarat, the state cabinet Saturday cleared Rs 200 crore for the preparation of the project. Moreover, based on the Gujarat model, a trust will also be formed under the chairmanship of the chief minister to oversee the project.
Besides, it also decided to form a high-powered committee, chaired by the CM, which will also have deputy CMs as well as three other cabinet ministers. Besides, five technical panels will also be constituted. The move comes at a time when the EC is likely to announce Lok Sabha election schedule soon. Cabinet Minister Srikant Sharma called it an “ambitious project” of the Chief Minister.
It has been decided that while the state government would spend funds for development of the infrastructure surrounding the statue and for promoting tourism in Ayodhya, the funds for the construction of the statue will be collected through donations or corporate social responsibility.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The state government has also decided to sign Memorandum of Understanding with the Gujarat government to understand the engineering preparations of the Statue of Unity. Citing example of the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in France, Avaneesh Awasthi, additional Chief Secretary (Tourism), said that the proposed statue will make Ayodhya iconic from the point of view of tourism.
“Twenty-eight hectares will be acquired in the first phase for the project, while an MOU will be signed with the Gujarat government for engineering, architectural and other technical guidance,” said Awasthi, adding, “it has also been decided that while the government will develop the infrastructure and facilities surrounding the site, the statue will not be built through government funds.” He further said, “Jo pratima banegi, koi sarkar dhan kharcha nahi hoga, CSR se ya daan se banegi. (For the statue, no government funds will be spent. CSR funds or donations will be used for the purpose).”Lucknow NewsVoting for UP panchayat polls beginsNames of BSP govt projects being changed due to casteist prejudice: MayawatiGovt working on Ambedkar’s principles to ensure benefits to all without discrimination: Yogi AdityanathClick here for more
The cabinet also cleared the details of the newly launched “Kanya Sumangala Yojna”, allocation for which was made in the recently-tabled state budget. As per the scheme, financial aid will be given to girl children in six phases. While Rs 2,000 will be given soon after her birth, Rs 1,000 will be given after she completets one year and subsequently after entire immunisation.

Three years since the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Statue of Unity on October 31, 2013, the Statue of Unity is beginning to take shape. While the original plan included the construction of a viewer’s gallery at close to 182 meters, from the eyes of the statue, the engineering teams have now decided to restrict the viewers’ entry to 157 meters, which will comprise a gallery at the chest level of the statue.
Each of the three CMs of Gujarat since its foundation have laid a foundation stone for a part of the project. After Modi laid the main foundation stone, a year later, then CM Anandiben Patel laid the foundation stone for the Shresth Bharat Bhavan. Her successor Vijay Rupani recently laid the foundation stone for a memorial near the statue. After completing the work on the raft foundation, the engineering teams working on the structure have now commenced the construction on the actual statue, beginning with its feet.  This is one of the first of Gujarat government’s projects to call for crowdfunding, with the largest individual contribution having been made so far, as per the official website, being Rs 50,000.
Watch what else is making news

Officials of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd, which is part of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET), the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed by the Gujarat government to execute the project, say that currently the construction is being done for the core wall and drum wall — RCC spine of the statue — on which steel frames will be affixed to hold the bronze cladding together, which will be the facade of the Sardar Patel statue. These concentric concrete cores will house elevators and stairways as well as platforms at various levels for viewing. The steel framework, also being procured from China, will be “contoured in the form of the statue” and the cladding will be the facade. The engineer ads that the statue’s “jump form” construction assembly will be a “self-climbing one”, with built-in hydraulic lifting jacks that will move the structure upwards during its construction.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Superintending Engineer R G Kanungo said, “The core will rise up to about 162 meters of the structure — forming the statue’s body up to chest. However, unlike earlier when the visitors would be able to rise to the height of the structure’s head with a viewing gallery through the statue’s eyes, the engineering teams have realised that it is not feasible. The viewing gallery will now be at 157 meters through the statue’s chest. The head of the statue will only be accessible to maintenance teams.”
At the off-site fabrication units of the statue, workers have readied the plaster moulds for the feet of the statue. Kanungo said that the bronze cladding will begin in phases, along with the construction, beginning from the feet.

The bronze cladding will be shipped in from TQ Art Foundry belonging to Jiangxi Tongqing’s workshop in Nanchang in Eastern China and fitted in stages. SVPRET officials say the workshop has completed “precasting” the feet and the Dhoti of the statue for the first stage, which will arrive in India a few weeks later. By December end, officials and artists from the Chinese company will join the engineers of contracted giant L&T to assist in assembling the cladding on to the structure.
The construction teams have also completed the work of the raft foundation as well as the work for retaining and peripheral walls. Official sources say that close to Rs 500 crore have been spent on the project so far. However, the work on the Shresth Bharat Bhavan has not commenced due to land acquisition issues.

K V Sanghavi, chief engineer, project director, SVPRET, said that the work on the allied projects of the Statue of Unity would commence shortly. “We have resolved the issue of the land acquisition and are in the process of finalising plans. We will begin the construction on the Shresth Bharat Bhavan soon.”"

On the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth, the Union government has planned a “Swachhata Diwas” event in Ahmedabad where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will declare the entire nation “Open Defecation Free” (ODF) at an event that will be attended by 20,000 sarpanches from across India, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said on Wednesday.
“This will be the biggest social revolution post-independence,” Patel told mediapersons. The event that has been organised on October 2 on the Sabarmati Riverfront and Sabarmati Ashram.
The deputy chief minister said that 10,000 sarpanches will be coming from across Gujarat for the event while an additional 10,000 will come from various states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Haryana. The Gujarat government will be hosting them for three days, and has arranged for 400 buses to take them to the Sabarmati Riverfront where the event will be held.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Patel said sarpanches from outside the state will start arriving from September 29. These sarpanches have grouped into four zones and will be taken to places connected with Mahatma Gandhi in those zones. Those included in Surat zone will be taken to Dandi Memorial at Navsari, those in Vadodara zone will be taken to Statue of Unity which has been “built in memory of Gandhiji’s colleague Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel”, while those in Mehsana and Ahmedabad zones will taken to Dandi Kutir in Gandhinagar.
When asked why Porbandar — the birthplace of Mahatma — and Rajkot have been left out, Patel said that the event in Ahmedabad is being organised in addition to the celebrations at Porbandar and Rajkot.
He said all 20,000 sarpanches will be given a jute bag containing a half-jacket, cap, pen and a souvenir of the Statue of Unity. When asked how much money will be spent on the event, Patel merely said it was an event organised by the Government of India. He said other ministers from the Union government, judges, academicians and others have also been invited for the event."

While giving the work order, Patel said the project would help bring in investment of Rs 6,000 crore in the tribal-dominated region for its extensive development.
The Statue of Unity project is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It envisages the construction of 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Sadhu Island, 3.3 km away from the Narmada Dam, in Narmada district.
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) has been working on the project’s implementation. It had floated a global tender to construct and maintain the statue. The tender has eventually been granted to L&T which will build the same at the cost of Rs 2,989 crore. The project is expected to be completed by 2018.
	
	
		
			
Awarding the work order for the tender to L&T, the CM said this would be the first step towards paying a befitting tribute to Sardar Patel who unified the country. Patel said the statue will help bring in investment worth Rs 6,000 crore in the tribal region which will help extensive development of the same and bring the tribals into the mainstream."

Express Photo
Archery, an Olympic sport with tribal origins, is being introduced as part of training of probationary officers of civil services, in a novel attempt that could help build “patience, focus and concentration” among “young administrators…starting a career in public service at a time when aspirations of people and expectations from public servants has increased tremendously.”
Probationary officers undergoing training since August at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA), Mussoorie, will be taught the nuances of the sport by Gujarat’s own Archery national champion Dinesh Bhil from Chhota Udepur, at a three-day workshop from November 13 to 15 there.
Bhil, who has now dedicated his life to training tribal youths in the sport, runs an archery academy in Naswadi taluka of Chhota Udepur. He left on Tuesday from Chhota Udepur to Mussoorie to conduct the special archery course for 370 officer trainees.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Archery is known to build concentration, focus and also patience,” Bhil said, speaking to The Indian Express. “More than physical strength, it is the mind that needs to be strong. Anyone who plays the sport will need to master the technique of control and coordination. It will be a useful exercise for the officers,” he added, saying he was honoured to be invited to train the officers.
Seeking the champion archer’s services, course coordinator of the ongoing training programme of the civil service officers, NK Sudhanshu, wrote to the Director General of the Sports Authority of Gujarat, under whom Bhil works as a trainer for archery. “The administrators need to have empathy, sensitivity, focus and balance to live up to expectations (of the public). Officer trainees need to acquire leadership skills to respond to challenging situations in their career,” Sudhanshu said, in his letter stating that a three-day hands-on training session in Archery, being planned for the officer trainees of the 94th Foundation Course, would help instill these qualities.
The LBSNAA decided to include the archery course in its training, after the civil services trainees expressed interest in the sport during their brief stay at the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony in Narmada district in October this year, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed them during the ‘Aarambh’ programme.
Chhota Udepur Collector Sujal Mayatra said the LBSNAA officials and trainee officers interacted with Bhil and got a taste of archery at the time. “The trainee officers attended a cultural programme at a village in Chhota Udepur during their stay in Kevadia Colony in the neighbouring district of Narmada,” Mayatra told this newspaper. “Dinesh Bhil, being a popular figure in the tribal community due to his achievements as an archer, was also part of the event and we showcased archery at the event too.” Watching the sport showcased, the officers became “extremely interested in learning the skill”, so the LBSNAA decided to include it in their training this time, the collector said. “It will allow officers to get a new perspective, try something new. Usually, the lectures are extremely academic in nature, but including a sport will pave way for more creative ways to conduct this programme for sure. It is an advantage for the trainees now, which we did not have as trainees earlier” Mayatra added."

Praising the vision of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday said he was the “inspiration” for the government’s decision on J&K to resolve a decades-old issue and “walk on a new path”.
Speaking at a rally at the Statue of Unity site, Modi, who turned 69 Tuesday, said: “Today, India is trying to complete all the tasks that have remained incomplete since Independence. For 70 years, the people of Jammu and Kashmir were discriminated against as a result of which the entire country suffered in the form of violence, separatism and incomplete aspirations.”
“A decision was taken after decades to walk on a new path to solve this issue. I have complete faith that with the active co-operation of the lakhs of friends from Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Kargil, we will be able to successfully chart a new course of development and confidence (vikas aur vishwas).”https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Recalling Patel’s contribution, Modi said that on this day in 1948, Hyderabad agreed to be a part of India, and “India has again accomplished the dream of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel”.
The Prime Minister was referring to the government’s August 5 announcement, ending J&K’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and the state’s bifurcation into two Union Territories."

BJP functionaries, shipping agents, ship recyclers from Alang and representatives from other industrial sectors were among the first passengers who accompanied Chief Minister Vijay Rupani for the maiden voyage of a new Ro-Pax ferry that carried passengers and vehicles across the Gulf of Khambhat between Ghogha (Bhavnagar district) and Dahej (Bharuch district) on Saturday.
While addressing a public gathering near Gogha terminal before undertaking the journey, the Chief Minster said that he would launch a similar ferry service between Ghogha and Surat by December.  “Currently, the service is till Dahej. This is cumbersome for people who want to visit Surat which is about three hours away from Dahej. So, we have requested the CM to extend the service till Hazira (which is about 30 minutes drive from Surat),” Harsh Patel, president of Sihor Steel Re-rolling Mills Association, travelling onboard the Ro-Pax ferry said.
During its inaugural run, the vessel — Voyage Symphony —left Gogha terminal at 3 pm and reached Dahej around 5 pm — a distance of 17 nautical miles covered in nearly 2 hours. The ferry is expected to run alongside the passenger ferry — Island Jade — that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2017 to cut down the tedious eight hour journey between the two locations.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
In the inaugural ride, two empty luxury buses were part of the convoy of eight-odd heavy vehicles that were allowed to board on the lowest deck of the ferry. The second deck is meant for private cars, and the third for passengers.

“This ferry service will open the gates of Saurashtra region to industrial development. There are a lot of industrialists from Saurashtra who have diamond and textile and other businesses in south Gujarat. This service will not only help the industrialists and employees get easy connect to their native villages in Saurashtra, but it will also provide them with an option to use the cheaper land in Saurashtra for expansion of their business,” said Girish Shah, former BJP president and the incumbent chairman of Alang Area Development Authority, which is responsible for development of infrastructure in a 131 square kilometre area that includes eight villages of Ghogha.
Chetan Contractor, the CMD of Indigo Seaways Ltd, which is operating the Ro-Pax service, said, “We are targeting to attract more truck and bus operators to this vessel that was built as a passenger vessel in South Korea in 2015, but we got it re-fitted and re-modelled as a Ro-Pax vessel in China.”
According to him, nearly 12,000 people travel daily between Saurashtra and south Gujarat, and over 5,000 vehicles ply between these two regions. Also on board the vessel, alongside CM Rupani, was state BJP president Jitu Vaghani.

“We have come despite the Ekta Yatra (taken out to popularise the Statue of Unity project) being organised in our area. About 10-15 per cent of the passengers today onboard this ship are BJP functionaries,” said Rajesh Parmar, head of the BJP’s OBC wing based at Botad.
Twenty-eight-year-old travel agent from Bhavnagar, Amish Shah, said that he was part of a 14-member team of shipping agents who have been offered a free ride on the Ro-Pax ferry so that they could get a first-hand experience of the travel and later help popularise the service. “I got an invite just two days ago and I didn’t want to miss meeting the chief minister on board,” said Shah.
Similarly, a ship-breaker from Alang ship-breaking yard, Amit Padia said that he and two other ship-breakers from Alang had undertaken the journey on the invite of local BJP leaders. “We wanted to be part of the history being scripted in the region,” he said.
Bhagwan Dholakia, cousin brother of diamond baron Savji Dholakia, said he and 14 members of his family will undertake the sea journey on the new ferry on Monday. “We are here to attend a spiritual programme. We will be returning by this ferry on Monday,” said Dholakia, a resident of Lathi in Amerli district."

The statue, a towering memorial dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was put up for sale for Rs 30,000 crore to donate the money for medical and health care equipment for COVID-19.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s first budget saw chunks of copy-pasted schemes from the Gujarat budgets under him as chief minister, like the round-the-clock power supply, riverfront project, Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana for tribals, smart cities, solar power generation along canals, “rurbanisation” and even launching of  theme-based tourist circuits.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s maiden budget clearly drew inspiration from Gujarat, the state he represents as Rajya Sabha MP. Jaitley said in his speech, “Gujarat has demonstrated successfully the Rurban development model of urbanisation of the rural areas, through which people living in the rural areas can get efficient civic infrastructure and associate services. Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission will be launched to deliver integrated project based infrastructure in the rural areas, which will also include development of economic activities and skill development.” Through the Rurban model, Gujarat has identified over 200-odd villages where it is already giving “urban facilities” in rural areas.
So Jyotigram project launched by Modi in Gujarat in 2003 became Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti yojana in the Union budget 2014-15 and the “beti bachao, beti vadhavo (save the girl child, welcome the girl child)” introduced in Gujarat after the 2001 census showed a sex ratio skewed against girls merged with the Kanya Kelavni campaign, got bigger and is called, “Beti bachao, beti padhao” in its India version. And the Statue of Unity project to build the world’s tallest statue as a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is now a national project with Rs 200 crore Central allocation.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Most of the successful projects in Gujarat have found a reflection in the Union budget. Be it Beti Bachao, Jyotigram Yojana, Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana, etc. Most of these projects were part of the Gujarat model that has been widely popularised,” said Arun Kumar Jagatramka, CMD of Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd on the sidelines of a budget viewing session organised by the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) here.
Another popular scheme for providing 24×7 uninterrupted power supply – Jyotigram Yojana – gets a national platform through the Union budget. Christened as Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, with an allocation of Rs 500 crore, the programme calls “for feeder separation” to augment power supply to the rural areas and for strengthening sub-transmission and distribution systems. “This yojana at a national scale will turn out to be a power saver for the NDA government,” said Vimal Ambani, Managing Director, Tower Overseas Ltd.
Similar is the “Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana” where Rs 100 crore has been allocated for welfare of tribals. The NDA government also launched the Rs 100-crore Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana for generating awareness and also help in improving the efficiency of delivery of welfare services meant for women.
The soil-health cards and soil-testing laboratories popularised by the Gujarat government through annual Krishi Mahotsav also finds a mention in Jaitley’s budget who set aside Rs 100 crore for the card and an additional Rs 56 crore to set up 100 mobile soil-testing laboratories across the country. R Mukundan, Managing Director, Tata Chemicals Ltd, welcomed the move to replicate the soil-health card, in his reaction to the budget.
Another concept that has links with Gujarat, is the smart city project. The Union budget has allocated a sum of Rs 7,070 crore for development of smart cities in India. The GIFT City project in Gandhinagar and the Dholera project in Ahmedabad district are likely to benefit, say industrialists in the state. “We can see the effect of Gujarat Model in this budget wherein in the lines of Gujarat certain schemes have been announced…these are all highly welcome,” said Piruz Khambatta, Chairman, Rasna Pvt Ltd.
The NDA government has also taken the Gujarat’s Sabarmati Riverfront project to Delhi and chosen Kedarnath, Haridwar, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Patna and Delhi for “Ghat development and beautification of river front”.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
“A number of incentives in the Union budget has been directed at Gujarat. Be it the Rs 25-crore investment allowance for new plant and machinery or the provision for start-up entrepreneurs, Gujaratis stand to benefit. The budget also provides incentives for a number of sectors in Gujarat including textiles, infrastructure, chemicals, solar power and the Alang ship-breaking yard,” said Yogesh Shah, Partner, Deloitte Haskins & Sells."

With the state government making preparations for the Vibrant Gujarat summit which according to officials has generated 23,67,000 jobs in the state since 2003, the Patidar community in Gujarat is set to start preparations for the second edition of the “Global Patidar Business Summit” from Saturday.
Community body, Sardardham Vishwa Patidar Kendra (SVPK), began organising such summits in the wake of the Patidar agitation for reservations in jobs and education in 2015, to provide jobs to the youths of the community. The first such summit was held in 2018.
“The summit in 2018 was very successful… We managed to provide jobs to 2,650 persons through the summit. From Saturday, we begin preparations for our next summit which will be held in January 2020,” said Gagji Sutariya, president of SVPK.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“We are glad that like the Patidars, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Thakor samaj also organised similar summits…,” Sutariya said.
On Saturday, the organisation will begin bookings for the 2,000 stalls that they plan to set up during the summit in 2020.
Apart from the business summit due next year, the community will organise a “Chintan Shibir” at the Statue of Unity, where 250 industrialists will come together to contemplate the issues of job creation.
“The chintan Shibir is expected to be held before March 2019,” Sutariya said.
On the need for Patidar organisations to organise such business summits with the state government organising the biannual Vibrant Gujarat summit, Sutariya said, “The government is doing it’s best but others need to come forward to fill in the gaps. We are organising the summit every alternate year and we are ensuring that it does not clash with the government’s Vibrant summit.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

According to a release from the Defence wing, the seaplane, which will be operated by SpiceJet, is a Twin Otter 300 and registered in the name of M/s Spicejet Technic. On Sunday afternoon, the seaplane took off from Male in Maldives and made a successful landing inside Venduruthy channel for a technical halt. “The seaplane was provided assistance with berthing facility at Naval jetty and refueling for their onward journey. The seaplane is scheduled to fly to Ahmedabad where it will commence flying as a part of regional connectivity scheme between Sabarmati river front and Statue of Unity,” the release said.
A senior officer of the Gujarat government added that the said seaplane is manufactured by a Canadian company and has been one of the most preferred for operations and surveillance data collection across the globe.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“It can cover up to 290 kilometres per hour and can fly close to four hours at slower speed, which is ideally used for surveying. At faster speed or for tourism purposes, it should ideally take a break after two hours of run. The run from Male to Kochi was about 750 aerial kilometres, which is why it couldn’t have made it all the way to Gujarat without multiple stops. The fuel burn capacity for its normal cruise speed is just under three hours,” the official said. The seaplane can operate without pressurised cabin (supplemental cabin oxygen) upto 12500 feet.
Representatives of Spicejet, Indian Navy, CIAL and Kochi district administration were present to supervise the transit halt.
Vice Admiral AK Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command welcomed the aircraft in Kerala, from where it is scheduled to land in Mandovi river in Goa for another technical halt on Sunday before proceeding to Ahmedabad on Monday afternoon.
Officials said that the aircraft will arrive at Sabarmati Riverfront on Monday evening after a likely stopover at Panchmuli Lake-Dyke 3 of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam in Kevadia, which is a terminal for the operations in Gujarat. “The run from Kevadia to Ahmedabad is expected to be about 45 minutes for a technical run. The logistics have been worked out and it will most likely arrive in Kevadia on Monday,” said an officer.

After the state government and some Narmada district residents — affected by the land acquisition for the Kevadia colony near the Statue of Unity (SoU) — failed to come to a settlement in the ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) before the Gujarat High Court, the state government, on Thursday, challenged the maintainability of the petition as a PIL.
The state argued that given that the matter pertains to a land-related issue, the aggrieved parties must move a petition and not a PIL, which was moved by social activists.
The PIL was moved by activists Mahesh Pandya, Anand Mazgaonkar, Ashok Naik and Jatin Sheth in July, 2017, on behalf of the residents, villagers and tribals of the five villages of Kevadia, Vagadia, Navagam, Limdi and Gora.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The residents had submitted to have been adversely affected by the land acquisition for the Kevadia colony, near SoU in Narmada district.
The contention of the petitioners, so far, has been that while the state government acquired the land parcels in the five villages as long ago as 1960, 1961 and 1962, the villagers continued to be in possession of the land and cultivate it. The petitioners had thus contended, that if an acquired land remains unoccupied for five years, the acquisition lapses, as per the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act.
The state government also challenged and questioned the aspect that the petition is being moved in court 58 years after the land was acquired.
A reply is expected to be filed by the petitioners by January 28 to respond to the state government’s assertions."

Less than a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat’s Narmada district on the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Saturday finalised the details for the construction of a 221-metre long statue of Ram in Ayodhya. Asserting that the statue will be made of bronze, Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Avaneesh Awasthi said, “While the height of the Ram statue would be 151 metres, its overhead umbrella would be 20 metres while the pedestal would be 50 metres.”
Inside the base, there will be a provision for a “modern museum” that will showcase the history of Ayodhya and the entire “Ikshvaku Vansh” — right from King Manu to the present status of “Ram Janmabhoomi”.

The massive marathon run,which was held across 1,000 venues,saw participation from over 40 lakh people,Modi said,even as he appealed that the event not be viewed with the prism of politics. 
With this,the Gujarat government also expedites the programme to collect iron tools from farmers all across the country for Patels 182-metre Statue of Unity being constructed at Kevadia Colony in Narmada. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sardar Saheb was Iron Man,and this imagery will be used to collect iron from 7 lakh villages across the country. Sardar Saheb was a farmer,so all farmers will be asked to contribute iron tools from their farming work that is now out of use. (Sardar) worked towards uniting the country. This work is being started today. By February,this work will be taken forward. Sardars mantra of unity will be again revived, he said. Throughout the speech,Modi refrain from making comments on any political parties,keeping the event apolitical. 
This exercise is an effort to unite the people of the country.  So please dont measure this pious effort with the yardstick of politics. This is a work of patriotism,to unite the country, he added. 
Modi said the Statue of Unity will be a fitting tribute to the towering figure of unity in the country. Sardar sahib was the source,inspiration,and embodiment of unity. That is why,to make this Statue of Unity,we have taken the mission to join all seven lakh villages of India …When we remember Gandhiji,we remember truth,non-violence,sacrifice,simplicity,and Satyagraha. Similarly, Sardar Patel stands for unity,good governance and the farmer,” he said.
Speaking of the contribution of Sardar Patel,Modi said he dedicated his life to strengthen the unity of the country,but at the same time understood the value of diversity. Dont be mistaken. Indias diversity is the source of Indias strength. The diversity is not just our identity,but our tradition. There is no source of inspiration stronger than Sardar Saheb for the unity of this country, he said.
He said unity,good governance and public participation were factors which could take India among the league of worlds superpower. Over two lakh schools from across the country were approached to participate in the programme. An essay competition on the meaning of unity has been held across these schools,with over 5,500 winning schools being given over Rs 2.5 crore worth award,he said."

(Express Photo)
THE Kevadia police on Sunday arrested the driver of a luxury bus that collided with another bus near the Statue of Unity site on August 24, injuring 20 tourists.
Arvind Nayak, driver of the bus that hit another tourist bus from behind, was arrested. Haider Sheikh (22), driver of the overturned bus, stated in his complaint that he was ferrying tourists on his bus from View Point One towards Kevadia, when the other bus hit his vehicle from behind and overturned it.
Arvind was booked under IPC sections 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (Causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (Causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act (1988).

The two luxury buses collided and one of them overturned at Navagam in Kevadia colony, about 2 kilometers from the Statue of Unity. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon when over 25,000 footfall was recorded at the site.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Twenty passengers from both the buses were injured. While six of them were rushed to Vadodara Civil Hospital, around 90 km away, the rest of the injured were taken to the Garudeshwar Referral hospital for first-aid. “Eye witnesses told us that the buses were speeding and perhaps attempting to take a U-turn towards the Statue of Unity again. A crane had to be called in to lift the overturned bus,” an official said.
A press release from the state government said that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced full compensation for the medical expenses incurred by the injured.
According to the release, Kinni Patel (18) from Vadodara, who was injured, was airlifted from Kevadia to Vadodara in a tourist helicopter stationed at SoU, for immediate treatment and thereafter airlifted to Ahmedabad.
Meanwhile, all those injured were discharged Saturday night after preliminary treatment, apart from three injured — two of them are undergoing treatment in Ahmedabad, and one of them is undergoing treatment at the SSG hospital in Vadodara. However, the condition of all of them is said to be stable. The treatment expense is being borne by the Statue of Unity administration.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
On Saturday, the SoU recorded the highest number of tourist footfall since its inauguration in 2018. As many as 31,400 tourists visited the site on Saturday, surpassing the record of approximately 28,500 tourists on Diwali last year."

Singh was speaking at the Association of Domestic Tour Operators (ADTOI) annual convention in Kevadia Friday evening. Right now, the Taj Mahal in Agra is the top tourist destination in the country, clocking up to 70,000 visitors a day.
The Ministry of Tourism is supporting the ADTOI’s convention being held from February 12 to 14, as part of its engagement with the industry, and with a view to push the domestic tourism market.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Rupinder Brar, ADG, Ministry of Tourism, said Kevadia is an ideal example of how tourism can completely turn around the socio-economic situation of a region, generating employment opportunities for thousands of tribals in and around Kevadia.
The Statue of Unity — dedicated to Sardar Vallabhai Patel — is the world’s tallest statue with a height of 182 metres. Besides the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the Zarwani waterfalls, a number of tourist attractions have been built in the 7-km area around the statue, such as Jungle Safari, Cactus Park, Children’s Nutrition Park.
Speaking about the convention, Singh said that this Annual Convention is the first major physical event being organised by a stakeholder association post-lockdown. As many as 350-400 delegates, including Government dignitaries, domestic tour operators, airlines officials, and hoteliers are attending the event from all over the country.
Singh said, “India has a robust domestic market which could soften the impact of COVID-19 as compared with nations that rely largely on international tourists. Post lockdown and as the control over the spread of pandemic is achieved, it is widely agreed that domestic tourism will recover faster than international tourism.”Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

He introduced himself as Prashant Kishore to a reporter in the crowd.
The 35-year-old public health specialist, statistics whiz and a former UN mission chief in Africa has been associated with Modi and his office since December 2011, executing events that put the CM on the national scene. Considered the mentor of the Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), an “NGO” that powers initiatives that push Modi into a cool, tech-savvy fashionable “youth icon” mould, Kishore remains elusive.
The future of CAG, which began as an “apolitical” group, floated by a small bunch of young professionals, growing to 60 core members with over a lakh volunteers, will depend on the General Elections’ results. Interestingly, the political footnote for CAG is its presence in 29 Indian cities, like Lucknow, Kolkata, Varanasi, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Delhi, Lucknow and Patna, where the BJP was not so strong. Barring Kolkata, CAG has its left footprints in many Indian cities.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
“Many may get back to their old jobs, but some may get embedded with the MPs with whom they have worked during the elections. This is subject to the MPs securing important portfolios in the event of a Modi-led government. The BJP, which is already swamped by people wanting to wrest power for themselves, may not offer any work to these youngsters,” says a source from this highly secretive organisation.
The group burst on the scene in February 2013 as the backroom boys of Modi’s address at the annual conclave of Delhi’s Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), followed by the “Young Indian Leader’s Conclave” in June in Gandhinagar, featuring Modi and former President A P J Abdul Kalam.
A CAG spokesperson, who is an Indian School of Business (ISB) alumnus, with a banking stint in New Zealand and one of CAG’s nine board members, told this paper on conditions of anonymity, “The Indian CAG was formed by a group of professionals who quit their jobs in McKinsey and Company and came together to create a forum for bringing together politicians on a common platform to debate on national issues.
CAG organised a few events, like Manthan that featured a spectrum of leaders — Chandrababu Naidu, AAP’s Yogendra Yadav and Modi. We (CAG) saw Modi’s efficiency and decided to support him and add value to his campaign. We have a very flat organisational structure and Prashant Kishore is our mentor. He assists CAG’s Board of Directors in the decision-making.”
Modi’s anointment as BJP’s PM candidate in September 2013 saw CAG taking charge of events like the “Run for Unity” for Modi’s pet “Statue of Unity” project. To begin with, CAG operated out of BJP MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha-owned Lodha Group’s plush office buildings in Mumbai. Most CAG members are tech-savvy, having worked in MNCs. They have lived abroad and returned home, seeking to “change India”.
A source says, “The high point for them was that they got to sit with Modi and discuss ideas and implement them. With so many businessmen being part of the BJP in Gujarat and Maharashtra, it was not difficult for Modi to provide them with resources to function. Their ideas went through pilot runs before being executed.”
However, resources became a challenge in other states, till Kishore took over and created a central corpus. “Each core CAG member takes home at least Rs 2 lakh per month, which is a pittance compared to their pay in the MNCs,” the source adds. Interns hired through its portal are paid a small stipend and volunteers work for free for a two-three month stint.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
Like a corporate, CAG has various verticals like Research, Analytics, Technical areas and Campaign Management Associates (CMAs) that work in the field. As Modi’s fan following kept escalating, thanks to many endeavours by his public relations team and CAG, the sheer number of volunteers registering to join CAG has put a strain on its secrecy mandate. Modi’s roadshow in Vadodara on April 9 saw a swarm of CAG volunteers in identical blue kurtas mingling with the BJP members."

On Monday, the first batch of CISF personnel arrived in Kevadia and underwent Covid-19 antigen tests as part of the protocols. Officials said that the personnel tested negative but have been sent to self-quarantine for seven days, following which, an installation ceremony will be held.
As many as 272 CISF personnel have arrived in Kevadia and been sent to self-isolation in designated barracks, officials said. Nilesh Dubey, Deputy Collector, Kevadia, Narmada and also the Chief Administrator of Statue of Unity, said, “It has been under consideration since last year to hand over the security to CISF. The date of installation ceremony will be decided later.”
Officials said that CISF will guard the Statue of Unity to ensure a smooth flow of tourists once the facility reopens later this year. Currently, the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and the local police in Narmada manages the SoU premises. However, with the statue gaining popularity among tourists from different parts of the world, officials said that the government has been looking at a more “professional” management of crowd.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An official said, “The CISF is trained to handle installations and movement of people like in airports. They also manage the Taj Mahal. They ensure smooth movement. Unlike the local police that sometimes gets into verbal spat with visitors during heavy rush days. The deployment of CISF will take away the load from the SRPF and the police that have other peripheral projects around the SoU to supervise.” The official added that the CISF has been given the security charge of SoU keeping in mind the sensitivity to terror attacks.
“The Narmada Dam is already a sensitive installation and so is SoU now. So, the CISF will also have a permanent dog squad stationed in Kevadia for the statue,” the official added. The personnel will soon be joined by their families, according to officials. “Right now, they have been asked to report individually but we have assigned barracks to them keeping in mind that their families will move here with them eventually once the provisions are in place for schooling of their wards and other such needs,” the official said.
The official added that the number of personnel needed at the site was decided following multiple visits by teams of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as well as the CISF. “They considered the number of access points, entry for visitors, unmanned exits and other possible ways to venture in and out. Teams came from New Delhi as well as Navi Mumbai because this falls under the Western Zone of CISF,” said the official."

Wake N’ Bake creator: Rohan Joshi

Wake N’ Bake rating: 3 stars
Rohan Joshi seems to be handling life post AIB (All India Bakchod) quite well. He is slightly upset about his age — well he is a ripe old 36 — and has apparently made his peace with being called an uncle, but all in all he retains the edginess and the laughs that were a trademark of one of India’s finest comedy collectives. His first special, which is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video, called Wake N’ Bake, has him flying solo. For someone who did wonders with a team, a lot was at stake for Joshi, and he has made quite an earnest attempt.
The one-hour special was supposed to be about him ageing, societal expectations of marriage and his love for maal, as the trailer revealed. But Joshi played smart. He starts off soft, with jokes about low-energy levels, his disdain for road trips and why clubbing is a young man’s game. He also makes fun of his SSC education, which resonated with many in the packed hall. The audience are almost lulled into a sense of familiar comfort, with expected punchlines and premise. “I am 36 now, so that ten years patriarchy period that men get, that is also over,” he states, much to the chuckles of the crowd.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
After his bit about how he is an expert at passive-aggressive texting, he jolts the crowd with his stand on privilege and goes for the kill. He hops across the stage to “check his privilege”. “Check the hain”. “I am South Bombay born, wealthy English-educated — utters Joshi, as he takes a step with each point — “but SSC” — he takes half a step back and continues — “fair- skinned, CIS gender, heterosexual, Hindu, brahmin, man”, and Joshi had covered the entire expanse of the stage. “Nobody should get to have that many good adjectives in front of their name,” adds Joshi. He even added that if there was a rap song to be made about the struggles of his life, it would be extremely short.
AIB was known for its sharp political and social satire, which was blended with punchlines that went viral. Its absence has left quite a void in the comic/satire space, which the ilk of Kunal Kamra and Varun Grover are filling brilliantly. Joshi is a chip off the old block. After his bit about privilege and caste discrimination, when there is an uncomfortable silence in the auditorium, Joshi did what he does best– call you out. “I am seeing the lack of funny on your faces right now”.
Then he moves on to ganja, the bake bit of the stand-up, where he endorses the legalisation for marijuana. “Ab ki baar chill the F#@%k out yaar. I think this is the platform I am going to run for in 2024.” What follows is the next act, which is a dig at Sardar Patel’s Statue of Unity in Gujarat. He comments how we don’t really need to construct the statue, just hand out weed, and people riding the high would see anything they want to see.
For this, Rohan Joshi deserves to be lauded. Especially in today’s time, when political dissent and protest have become quiet polarised. Earlier in the act, he also made a joke at Aditya Thackeray. We wonder if the special was shot before the current Maharashtra government came to power.
The special does lack in pace, and some bits are quite predictable. Age as a comic gag has been done to death and beyond.
But in such times, we will take Joshi in all his SSC glory."

Bhupendra Rana
The Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s aggressive drive to widen roads as part of the Smart City Project raises questions over the fate of innumerable trees on the way. The two major roads of the city — the R C Dutt Road in Alkapuri and the Jail Road connecting the Rajmahal Road, both replete with age-old banyan trees to which the city owes its name Vadodara — are due for widening. The city was earlier called Baroda, the anglicised version of its ancient name Vatpadraka. The VMC, which has a banyan tree in its logo, has assured that it plans to include the characteristic banyans of the city as part of the road widening plan.
As per the VMC plan, the R C Dutt Road will be 36 metres wide — 18 metres on each side.While from the Station end to GEB Circle it is already 18 metres wide, from the other end the road is as narrow as 8 metres in some places. This stretch is also lined by nearly 100 banyan trees. The civic body plans to widen this stretch by acquiring compounds of private and government properties.
Watch What Else Is Making News

Besides the 100-odd banyans, countless trees on the compounds of the bungalows along the road are roosting sites of rose-ringed parakeets. While there is no official data regarding the exact number of parakeets roosting on these trees every evening, enthusiasts say the number could be as high as 70,000. Apart from parakeets, the trees are ideal site to spot other common garden birds that make up for the bio-diversity of the city.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
An avid birdwatcher and president of Baroda Management Association (BMA), Avi Sabavala said preservation of trees is as essential as development. Sabavala pointed out to how the city lost its population of vultures and garden sparrows.
“These trees on the R C Dutt Road are home to flocks of common garden birds like rose-ringed parakeets, spotted dove, red vented bulbul, laughing duck, purple sunbird, oriental whiteeye and tailor birds. When we cut trees, we are taking away the nesting sites. The result is that it is helping proliferate the blue rock pigeon population. So, the biodiversity is at stake,” said Sabavala, even as he maintained road widening is inevitable. “But the corporation has land to ensure that the trees can be replanted. We will have to look at alternatives with the help of technology.”
The road widening will also take away a portion of the compounds of characteristic bungalows that currently make up residences of the commissioner of police, district collector, principal district judge, and the Circuit House. Along with these structures, also in line are two bungalows owned by the Contractor family.
On the Faramji lane, adjacent to the R C Dutt Road, the VMC has already begun demolishing the compound of the Vadodara Railway Station. The civic body will broaden the road to 30 meters width.
Across the road is the landmark white bungalow owned by businessman Nikitin Contractor, who has been fighting a battle with the civic body in order to save a major portion of his land. Contractor has acquired a stay on the demolition of the compound of his house. Earlier, he was in a litigation with the Railways over encroachment of his property.
Contractor said, “Almost 100 years ago, our ancestors built these bungalows, which are part of the city’s heritage. Our family occupied the houses after Independence. Several decades ago, when the present day roads did not exist, we were requested to give away some land to build the original Faramji Road. We willingly did so. But time and again, we have been harassed by the authorities… influential people have an eye on our properties too.”
He said the government plan for road widening by acquiring private properties is “highly unfair”. “The civic body can draw roadlines wherever they wish, without compensating the citizens or even taking them into confidence. They first told me that they would demolish my property until my drawing room. Then there was a lull. Now, they have measured the property again and told me they will demolish up to my porch. How can I even allow that?,” Contractor said.
INTACH Gujarat co-convener Sanjeev Joshi does not think road widening is necessary and cites example of Parisian boulevards. Joshi said, “Road widening is not a solution. It has not been practiced world over. Our intention should be to protect the identity of these roads, even if they are narrow. So, if the characteristic of the R C Dutt Road is these trees, then we need to preserve it so that it doesn’t become like any other road. The R C Dutt Road has been an avenue to trees when the Race Course Road came up and is heritage by itself.”
In 2015, for a project of the state R&B Department, a total of 4,830 trees were cut to create a 29.6 km four-lane road connecting Vadodara to Dabhoi and onward to Kevadia Colony in Narmada district. This project is part of the Statue Of Unity project.
City-based activist Pankaj Darve, who has filed several applications under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to seek details about the mandatory procedure followed by the government agencies before felling the trees, said he received no reply. “I have sought information regarding the cutting of trees across Vadodara city by the VMC and also the R&B Department in 2015 on the Vadodara-Dabhoi stretch. While, the R&B and the Forest Departments kept transferring my applications to various departments, the VMC is yet to reply. It is unfortunate that our governments and administrative bodies do not understand the importance of preserving the green cover,” Darve said.
Along the Jail Road, iconic Shanta Devi Hospital has been razed reportedly to make way for a mall. The property is privately owned by the erstwhile royal Gaekwad family, and it is through the acquisition of part of this compound that the VMC is creating an additional lane to ease traffic from the existing Jail road.
VMC officials denied that trees were cut down to make the road. They said the VMC will transplant as many trees as possible in order to create this additional road.
Municipal Commissioner Vinod Rao said that special designers have been roped in to design the Jail Road and the RC Dutt Road, keeping the aesthetic beauty of the location intact. “Not a single banyan tree will be cut in the process of opening of road line. An equally important stretch where a lot of thick greenery is present, is the Jail Road. We have got a tree transplantation machine and started work,” Rao said.
Former principal secretary, forest and environment, S K Nanda said that between 2008 and 2010, the state government discussed a proposal to preserve banyan trees that indigenously grow in Vadodara. Nanda said, “ Trees grow in specific areas, like the banyan tree which is indigenous to Vadodara… we tried to plant more banyan trees in Vadodara in the two years. But the proposal was lost with time. A lot of discussions took place and we also conducted a tree count.” Nanda said that out of close to 40 lakh trees of various species found in Vadodara, around 10 lakh are banyan trees.
He noted: “In Bali (Indonesia), they have made roads around the trees in such a way that the trees act as speed breakers.”
The former senior official also cited the example of the Veraval-Rajkot National Highway expansion. “I had stayed the chopping of the trees, and forced the NHAI to change the design. Those trees — mostly banyan and peepal — were planted by the Nawabs of Jungadh, which were not less than 100 years old. I was more concerned about the banyan trees, which formed a canopy on the road. I forced them to change the alignment of the road.”Pune NewsClear sky conditions, heat to return over Pune: IMD‘My father could not get a ventilator bed for 10 hours in Pune city,’ says late activist’s sonCovid norms: PCMC bars ‘guests’ in cooperative housing societies, violators to face Rs 10,000 fineClick here for more
Nanda said that a tree with more than a 30-cm girth cannot be transplanted without threatening its longevity. “There were countless trees on the compound where the new Vadodara airport stands today. It was at my insistence that the trees were transplanted and not chopped off. We had provided the transplant machines. However, transplanting has no role to play in the case of banyan trees in Vadodara that are hundreds of years old,” he added."

The second day of the 53rd annual DGP conference was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
While secrecy was maintained regarding the Friday proceedings, according to sources, discussions during the conference included issues pertaining to national security, threats emerging from cybercrime and left wing extremism.
A presentation was also made on the “Enduring legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and relevance of his political ideals today”, the sources said.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
PM Modi arrived at Vadodara airport early on Friday morning, and he was received by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel and state Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi. He then visited the Statue of Unity in Kevadia Colony of Narmada district, where he paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and later reached the tent city near the statue, where “luxury tents” have been set up for the conference.
Following his visit to the Statue, the PM tweeted, “As India’s Home Minister, his contribution towards building the framework of our security systems is immense.”
“I would specially urge you all to visit Kevadia and see the ‘Statue of Unity.’ Some friends told me that the Statue can also be seen during Delhi-Mumbai flights. So, next time you are flying that route do try to spot the Statue,” he said in another tweet.
The Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, CRPF cobra commandos, NSG commandos, Chetak commandos and Marine commandos participated in an ‘Ek Bharat, Sreshta Bharat’ parade, which was inspected by the Prime Minister.
Day two of the conference ended with a performance from all states on the ‘Ek Bharat, Sreshta Bharat’ theme.
Over 200 performers from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations performed various folk and classical dance forms of every state, including Kathakali, Mayurbhanj Chhau, Garba Raas, Lu Khangthamo, Bharatnatyam and others. The performances began with a tribute to Sardar Patel on a song titled ‘Humare hero hai Sardar’ which narrated the story of Sardar Patel unifying the 565 erstwhile princely states.
Another performance highlighted the festivals of India. A laser show also displayed life and times of Patel. The cultural event was followed by a dinner for all the senior police officials.
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju, Hansraj Ahir and all the senior police officials were also in attendance at the event."

With this,the Gujarat government also expedited the programme to collect used iron tools from farmers across the country for Patels 182-metre Statue of Unity being constructed at Kevadia Colony in Narmada. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Sardar Saheb was a farmer,so all farmers will be asked to contribute iron tools from their farm workshop,tools they no longer use…(Sardar) worked towards uniting the country. This work is being started today. By February,this work will be taken forward, he said.
Modi refrained from making any political comments. This exercise is an effort to unite the people of the country. So please dont measure this pious effort with the yardstick of politics. This is a work of patriotism,to unite the country, he said.

From Sardar Patel to Marshal Arjan Singh (who died on Saturday), to Babasaheb Ambedkar to the thirsty jawan at a BSF post on the Gujarat border with Pakistan to the World Bank, the prime minister connected several dots as he inaugurated the world’s second largest dam project (after the Grand Coulee Dam in the US) on his 67th birthday at Dabhoi town in Gujarat on Sunday. He stated that he was keeping an eye on the Statue of Unity for Sardar Patel, whose cladding has just arrived from China. Nor did he forget to wish badminton player P V Sindhu for winning the Korean Open. “You know me, I can’t do small things. I don’t think small, I don’t do small. With 1.25 billion people with me, I can’t dream small,” the PM said, flanked by Transport, Highways and Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.
In a tweet, the PM said : This project will benefit lakhs of farmers and help fulfill people’s aspirations. The inauguration of the dam in Gujarat is seen as a political gesture, especially as 85 per cent of the Narmada river’s catchment area lies in Madhya Pradesh. But the prime minister is from Gujarat, and elections are taking place in the state at the end of this year. Elections in Madhya Pradhesh, run by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for the last 12 years, will take place next year in 2018.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Only five hours from Dabhoi, or 271 km away, at Chota Barda village in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh, India’s best-known water activist Medha Patkar was offering “jal satyagraha” along with 30 fellow activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, vowing not to move from the spot even if the waters submerged them. “People will drown in the Narmada, but they will not move. Even as Modiji’s birthday is being celebrated with pomp and style, thousands of families will meet an untimely end,” Patkar said.

But the prime minister was invoking several mythological comparisons, casting himself in the role of the Son of India, notwithstanding its patriarchal connotations. “When a son gives water to its parched mother earth, what can be a bigger feeling of satisfaction. When animals will bless for the green pastures created by Sardar Sarovar, I will be a grateful son of Bharat Mata,” the PM said. He was also the direct legatee of independent India’s most important leaders, Modi said. “From the land of Bapu and Sardar Patel, the Sardar Sarovar dam is dedicated to the nation today. This will benefit crores of citizens,” he added on his Twitter timeline.
Certainly, the World Bank, which is formulating a new India strategy for its largest loan recipient, seems to have caught the attention of the prime minister. Last week, officials from the ministries of water resources and external affairs were in Washington DC to participate in World Bank brokered meetings with Pakistan on the Indus Waters Treaty, as if placating international opinion that India would not take any drastic steps with regard to the most basic issue of water.
This week, Modi was chastising the World Bank for daring to defy India and refusing a loan to build the Sardar Sarovar dam. Finance minister Arun Jaitley is travelling to Washington DC next month for talks with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim. “A massive misinformation campaign was launched against the project. The World Bank which had earlier agreed to fund the project, refused to give loan for it raising environmental concerns. But, with or without the World Bank, we completed the massive project on our own,” the PM told a large gathering in Dabhoi.
The charm of the big project, from the days of Jawaharlal Nehru who laid the foundation of the Sardar Sarovar in 1961, certainly continues to hold the Indian imagination in thrall. As long back as 1979, the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal approved the construction of 3000 small, 135 medium, 30 major and 2 mega dams – the Sardar Sarovar and the Narmada Sagar – spanning the 1,312 km-long Narmada river which flows across the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra before draining into the Arabian Sea.
The Narmada Valley authority is a multi-billion dollar project which will flood at least 13,385 hectares of forest land, displace thousands of tribal villages which will be submerged when the dam waters rise, including fertile lands. But it is also expected to provide water to 9000 villages and electricity to many more. Vijay Rupani has labeled it the “lifeline” of Gujarat.
Meanwhile, Twitter India clambered aboard the bandwagon of people wishing the prime minister happy birthday, with several balloons exploding on Narendra Modi’s Twitter page as soon as you open it."

The management of Statue of Unity, which has decided to remain open to tourists on March 29 — which is the regular day off for the tourist spot — will also keep all 31 attractions open for Holi.
The aviary, which was closed in February, is home to about 1,100 birds. There are two aviaries constructed as geodesic domes and is reportedly one of the largest in the world. While the Indian Aviary is 150-metre long, 50-metre wide, and 15-metre high, the exotic aviary is 125-metre long, 35-metre wide and 18-metre high. The aviary and the safari park will remain open for tourists even as zoos and gardens across major cities in the state have been closed down to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

Meanwhile, the jungle safari park also welcomed two new members, an African hippopotamus and a black panther.
On the other hand, the Narmada district collector has renewed the notification under Section 144 of CrPC which prohibits assembly of more than three persons. It has been in force in the entire district since the lockdown began in March last year. Resident Additional Collector HK Vyas told The Indian Express, “The notification is renewed every month due to ongoing Covid-19 guidelines. It applies to the entire district and also to Kevadia. The Statue of Unity, too, is following Covid-19 guidelines and maintaining social distancing which is why it is not a violation of the notification even if there are tourists visiting the place.”
Six employees of various eateries in the food court of the Statue of Unity had tested positive this week, causing a concern locally. The management says that it is enforcing Covid-19 protocols strictly and persons with tickets to the viewing gallery of the statue are only allowed to enter during the slots they have booked.

Meanwhile, the district administration has also started screening vehicles entering the district via the Maharashtra border at Dhanresha village in Sagbara taluka. People who are carrying negative RT-PCR reports, tests for which have been done in the last 72 hours, are being allowed to enter."

We have deployed six personnel at the spot to ensure security at the spot round the clock. This is a routine deployment, Shankar said. 
Sources said security was ensured at the site after Modis call for pieces of iron to construct the Sardar Patel statue caused local residents to threaten sit-ins to reclaim the spot which had religious importance for them. 
Villagers from nearby Limdi and other villages said Sadhu Tekri was actually called Varata Bawa Tekri and was a site of religious importance.

A father-son duo based in Noida near the national capital, who bagged the contract for making Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue for Gujarat, will be designing and sculpting the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to be set up mid-sea. The sculptors Ram Vanji Sutar (92) and his son Anil (59) of the Ram Sutar Art Creations Private Ltd have till date designed and sculpted three statues of Shivaji for different projects.
Stating that they are emotionally attached to this project, touted to be the world’s tallest mid-sea memorial, Ram Vanji says the “statue will create history”. A Maharashtrian born in a small village named Gondur some three kilometres from Dhule in Maharashtra, he said it’s a privilege of a lifetime for him and his firm to be associated with this project.
Despite being 92 years old, Ram Sutar has been working day and night and spends almost eight to 10 hours working on these two ambitious projects he claims to be emotionally attached to. “I have been working with my father for the last 22 years now and we work as a team,” said Anil Sutar, explaining their style of functioning.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The 210-metre-high memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Statue of Unity will be installed on a patch of rock spread over
16 hectares in the middle of the Arabian Sea. The idea was first discussed in 1995, during the tenure of the BJP-Shiv Sena government. It had been pending for years since and gained momentum during the last Congress-NCP government. However, the BJP too used the issue during the 2014 election campaign.
While both the projects are very ambitious politically, the statue of Patel in Gujarat has been very close to PM Narendra Modi himself. “We are now waiting for tenders to be floated for contractors with whom we will be working with. Otherwise our design is ready and approved. Apart from the replica, we have also prepared the framework of the statues made of thermacol and plaster of Paris at our workshop,” said Anil Sutar.
According to the Sutars, the monument from the sea level till the tip of the sword of the warrior king is 689 feet (210 metres) high, however the statue alone mounted on the horse will be 395-feet high from the base of the statue to the tip of the sword.
The monument of Patel in Sardar Sarovar is 607 feet (158 metres) high from the sea level. The statue (which will be standing) is 522 feet and will be erected on a 85 feet long building.
Anil Sutar said, “Keeping in mind the climate of Mumbai, the Shivaji statue will be made up of bronze and will have nearly
88 per cent copper. We have designed the dynamics of this statue keeping in mind the concept that Shivaji Maharaj’s greatness and bravery has to be showcased through this statue. Hence, the statue will be mounted on a horse with a sword in the warrior king’s hand.”
The statue, which will take at least two years to be completed, will have an elevator that will take the tourists from within the statue’s body till the top of the statue. “Tourists who wish to get a glimpse of the Nariman Point, Marine Drive and Mumbai’s skyline will be able to do so. Currently as per the design, tourists will be able to travel till the chest of the statue from the museum hall under the statue through the elevator,” added Anil Sutar.
Meanwhile, Sutar said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue to be erected in Gujarat will take another two years to complete.
“Around 40 per cent bronze casting and 60 per cent thermacol frame is completed for that statue. We are speeding up the work, still it will need some more time,” said Anil Sutar.Mumbai NewsBMC standing committee to meet virtually on Friday as HC disposes PIL seeking physical meetingMumbai: Man, kin get anticipatory bail in domestic violence caseMedical professional can’t be prosecuted without ‘gross’ negligence: Bombay HCClick here for more
Ram Sutar is a gold medallist from the J J School of Arts and has made more than 200 sculptures in 60 years. Many of the statues made by him and his son adorn the Parliament House in New Delhi, including the 16-feet-high Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in meditating pose, 18-feet-high statues of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and many other personalities."

“Sardar Vallabhbhai constructed the Somnath temple. He became immortal after doing good work. Jawaharlal Nehru never constructed a temple. He remained secular (Bin-sampradayik) and slowly his began to fade (from public memory). Nobody remembers him. But if one visits Somanath, we remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. So some things are connected with time,” said Patel while addressing a “Nidhi Samarpan Samaroh” held at Mahalaxmi Society in Paldi by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).
The event was held to begin collecting donations for building the Ram temple at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Patel further said that industrialist Jagal Kishore Birla will be remembered because he made a temple- Birla Mandir in Delhi.
“Everybody remember Birlaji. Why? He made a temple. He might have made other things, but had he not made the temple, he might have been forgotten with time.”
He also pointed out how the world’s tallest statue built by Prime Minister Narendra Modi – Statue of Unity in Kevadia — is attracting thousands of tourists to Gujarat.
In his speech, Patel also spoke about the issue of “love-jihad”.
“Why do we have to bring laws (to counter) love jihad. Why do our sons and daughters venture out of our culture. Why do people of other religion keep an evil eye on our girls. This is a matter that needs contemplation. At this time, we can do many things. We are trying as well,” Patel said.
He later told mediapersons that representations have already been made before Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to bring a love-jihad law similar to the one in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

“Some narrow minded people who think that nobody should survive in the world except them; those who think their religion should be the only surviving one in the world; this will not work any day. Till the time there is Mother India and the saffron flag exists, nobody has the strength to remove ‘bharatiya sanskriti’ from the world,” Patel further said.
Patel also named some initial contributors who gave contributions for the Ram temple.

The Narmada police arrested 10 people from Kevadia village for protesting against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s event — with regard to land aquisition for development projects — on National Unity Day held at the Statue of Unity, on Thursday. According to the police, the accused villagers pushed and threatened the police personnel who had reached the village to keep a check on the law and order situation.
As per a complaint filed by a constable who was on duty in that area, he had received information about the protest and reached the village, along with his team. A group of 10 villagers were seated on a small hillock close to the Narmada river and were protesting by raising slogans, he said in his complaint. When the policemen approached them, the villagers allegedly pushed them and threatened them to leave the village and let them continue with their protest.
The villagers were identified as Jayesh Tadvi, Jignesh Tadvi, Ishwar Tadvi, Nanubhai Tadvi, Ratilal Tadvi, Jyotindra-bhai Tadvi, Sachinbhai Tadvi, Jigneshbhai S Tadvi and tribal activists from the area, Lakhan Musafir and Sudanshu Mitra.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

“We had to check that no law and order situation was created in the area during the National Unity Day celebrations. Our police team had reached Kevadia village after information of an ongoing protest. When our team reached there, they were pushed and threatened by the villagers. An offence was registered against them and they were subsequently arrested because of their behaviour,” a police official said.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Several villages of Narmada have turned into fortresses thanks to the overnight police patrol, ahead of Chief Minister Anandi Patel’s visit here on Friday morning.
Patel will inaugurate the work of the construction of Narendra Modi’s pet project, Statue of Unity to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and also lay the foundation stone for the construction of a hotel cum convention center, Shresth Bharat Bhavan at Kevadia colony on Friday.
The district administration, on instructions from the government has fortified neighbouring villages after an input from the state intelligence department that several tribals affected by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam project and awaiting rehabilitation are to hold a black-flag protest against Patel.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Accordingly, police units from four districts — Narmada, Vadodara, Dahod and Bharuch — along with the Local Crime Branch and Special Operations Group units have begun combing villages since Wednesday afternoon to thwart any plans of protests. Sources in the LCB said personnel in plain clothes will also be present in the audience at the event that Patel will address from a barricaded stage.

“After inputs that tribals are planning to barge into the event with black flags, we are taking no chances. There are three layers of security personnel at the venue and this time, we have also installed a wire mesh to separate the stage and the audience for the Chief Minister although it is not part of her security protocol. But we are being cautious. Other teams have also come in to help us enforce law and order,” an officer posted at the venue said.
Villagers from Kevadia, Kothi, Navagam Limdi, Gora, Vaghodia and Wier are under the eyes of security forces as several tribals here are demanding rehabilitation after dislocation because of the project. A unit of district police also patrolled the Naswadi taluka of Chhota Udepur all through Wednesday night in search of 14 tribals from Baroli who had attempted suicide by jumping into the Narmada canal two weeks ago, protesting the ‘government apathy’ towards their pleas for fertile farm lands for rehabilitation.
However, the 14 tribals were untraceable to the police forces. Although cops deny detaining any tribals, the villages have been virtually cordoned off.
Patel is expected to arrive at the venue at 11 am and will complete the inauguration of the construction of the Statue of Unity by L&T as well as the foundation stone laying ceremony of the convention center by 12 pm. On October 31, last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his capacity had laid the foundation stone of the Statue of Unity at the same venue."

THE KISAN Satyagraha, a farmers’ public meeting by quota leader Hardik Patel and senior BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha in Junagadh, which would coincide with the inauguration of the Statue of Unity by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, got a green signal from Junagadh district administration late on Tuesday.
Hardik Patel, the convener of Patidar Anamat Andolon Samiti (PAAS), has announced that he would organise the Kisan Satyagraha in Vanthali town in Junagadh district on Wednesday and that former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha and BJP MP from Patna Sabhi Shatrughan Sinha will also address farmers at the event.
The event will be held between 5 pm and 8 pm on Wednesday, a few hours after the Prime Minister will inaugurate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue — Statue of Unity — in Narmada district.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Brijesh Patel, PAAS convener for Rajkot district who is playing a leading role in the Patidar quota agitation in Saurashra region, said that the the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Vanthali K P Jethva had granted them permission for the event. Vallabh Vamja, a resident of Vanthali, had applied for the permission for the event. There were some apprehension among the organisers as the application was pending till Tuesday evening.
However, late on Tuesday evening, the SDM confirmed to The Indian Express that the administration had granted permission for the rally.
“Farmers from Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Rajkot districts will attend the Kisan Satyagrah in huge numbers. Through the event, we shall demand that Patidars and other upper caste families who are economically backward be given reservation in government jobs and educational institutes, waive debts of farmers and that Alpesh Katheriya, who is innocent, should be released,” said Amit Thummar, a PAAS functionary of Junagadh. Katheriya, a key Hardik aide, has been arrested in connection with a sedition case.
Hardik had announced that through the Kisan Satyagrah event, they would fight the injustice being meted out to the farmers of Gujarat. He had said that by walking the path shown by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, he would try to ensure that farmers get their rights.
October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first deputy prime minister and home minister of India who is credited for unifying 562 princely states the country and securing their accession to the Union of India.Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more

Reiterating that the country would soon be “Congress-free”, the Gujarat Chief Minister said that the recent Assembly elections in five states was a trailer of how the 2014 Lok Sabha elections would be.
He further pointed that while the Congress had been a loser in the assembly polls, it was all the more evident that the party performance even worse in the constituencies belonging to the SCs and STs.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Accusing the Congress of double standard, Modi claimed that though the party always talked about eradicating poverty, it never actually worked towards it. He went on to say that the Congress was just not willing to accept that a ‘tea-seller’ was standing tall against them.
Congress governments have failed to eradicate poverty despite repeatedly projecting it as a main plank for the last 60 years, he said.
In a sarcastic tone, he said he has been wondering for long as to why the poverty has been increasing despite the poor voting for the Congress all these years.
“Now I have got the answer. The Congress’ political future lies in keeping them poor… Its mentality is anti-poor,” he added.
He also attacked UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, saying that the father-son duo had been following him across the state. Citing that Mulayam and Akhilesh had said that Modi could never convert Uttar Pradesh into a Gujarat, the firebrand leader said that the father-son duo did not know what being Gujarat meant.
“Netaji, do you know the meaning of coverting to Gujarat? It means 24-hour electricity in every village and street. You can’t do it. It requires 56-inch chest,” Modi said, apparently suggesting that it requires decisiveness.
Accusing the Samajwadi Party of ruining Uttar Pradesh, Modi said that there was immense potential in the state but there was no political will to develop it and better its condition. He also said that all three parties – Congress, SP and BSP – merely engaged in vote-bank politics.
Modi said that the country was not poor, but it was made poor because of the misdeeds of political parties like Congress.
“This country is not poor. The people of this rich country has been kept poor for the sake of politics… You give me 60 months and I promise you a life of happiness and peace,” he said.
Earlier, hailing people for attending the rally in huge number, Modi said, “On my way to the venue on the helicopter it looked like a sea of people,” adding that every BJP rally breaks records.
He also talked about Sardar Patel’s Statue of Unity, thanking people of Uttar Pradesh for their immense support. “The Statue of Unity will be much taller and bigger than the Statue of Liberty,” said Modi.
Modi further invoked Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose on his birthday as he asked the people to elect “this sevak (servant)” after giving chances to “rulers” for 60 years.
Referring to Subhash Chandra’s Bose’s famous lines ‘you give me blood, I will give you freedom’, he said, “You (people) give me 60 months and I will give you a life of peace. I have come here to make this promise.”"

(Javed Raja)
For the first time, a Modi rally in Gujarat had an entry fee. The first Vijay Shankhnaad rally to mobilise  the youth, held at the Sardar Patel stadium, where Modi took oath as CM for the third time in 2012, had an entry fee of Rs 10 per ticket.
It was an all-out Modi show, with M-O-D-I painted on the wall behind the stands swamped with people wearing  NaMo-For-PM saffron caps, NaMo T-shirts and some shirtless youths sporting ‘Vote for Modi , Vote for India’ as body paint. Modi, who was at least two hours late, devoted most of his speech to reciting an unusually long patriotic poem, whose author he did not name.
Ahead of Modi’s arrival, nearly a dozen custom-made Modi songs blared from the speakers. The songs included “Modi Statue of Unity ko anthwa ajooba banayenge’ (Modi will make Statue of Unity the eighth wonder), ‘Aayi Modi Ki Sena, Tension mein Sonia’ (Modi’s entry has left Sonia Gandhi in tension) and ‘Modiji ki sena chali, Ramji Karenge Bhali’ (Here goes Modi’s army, Lord Ram will do the rest). But the one that took the cake was in a heavy American accent, picked from the Obama presidential campaign, that went, “Yes we can. Yes we do”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Photographs of senior party leaders from Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani had to compete with a backdrop with various Modi slogans and ‘NaMo’ in Devanagri script. A square-shaped plank with a ‘BJP 272+’ cut-out rotated on the extreme right of the stage.
“It is for the first time that an entry fee has been charged in Gujarat. The huge turnout proves the enthusiasm of young BJP workers and Modi’s popularity,” said youth BJP president Pradeep Vaghela.
Some participants, however, denied having paid the fee. “I have come on my own. And there was no entry fee,” said Dipak Bishnoi, who hails from Jodhpur. He also claimed to have paid for his expenses to come to the rally. Local youngster, Ratan Singh, who works as a daily wager in Navrangpura, said, “I haven’t paid anything to get an entry.”
“More than 50,000 caps and an equal number of T shirts have been distributed,” said a senior BJP leader. Volunteers were seen distributing the merchandise at the entry gate.
In his speech, Modi accused the Congress of not fulfilling promises made to youth in its 2013-2014 budget.
“They (UPA) had set aide a fund of Rs 1,000 crore for the skill development training. They announced to train 10 lakh youths, but so far have trained only 18,352 youths,” said Modi addressing the nearly 60,000 strong audience.
“At this rate, the Congress will take 20 years to train 10 lakh youths,” he further added.
Speaking in Hindi, Modi once again evoked his modest background and alleged that the Congress see him as trouble. “For the first time in 60 years, somebody has challenged their sultanat (empire),” said Modi.
He added, “They search for an opportunity to hit Modi, eliminate Modi. But what can they do? They try to trap me through CBI or courts. They don’t know that we are here to serve Maa Bharti. If not in this life, we will serve Bharat Mata in next life. We have not left home for position and power. This is the reason why my every line hurts them.’’Ahmedabad NewsEight Pak nationals apprehended with 30 kg heroin off Jakhau coastPermit home delivery of food till 10 pm: GCCI writes to PM ModiTalala, hub of Kesar mango goes for voluntary lockdownClick here for more
He said, even before the polls, for the first time the people have taken their decision. It is not candidates but the people of this nation who are contesting, Modi said, evoking huge response from the crowds."

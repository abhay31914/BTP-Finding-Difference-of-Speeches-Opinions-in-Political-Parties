Taking a dig at Naidu, Owaisi dubbed him as an 'expert on Sharia, asking the minister to not be selective and speak on other issues also concerning the Muslim community.      ""Well, the nation now has a new expert on Sharia who happens to be Venkaiah Naidu. I would ask him to explain to us what is Sharia? Why is Naidu not talking about the rights of Pilu Khan's blind mother, about rights of Zakia Jafri, about Akhlaq's wife and mother, and Najeeb's mother? So, this selective talking about rights is not acceptable to us,"" Owaisi told ANI.      Owaisi further said that when the Supreme Court is to hear the matter from May 11 onwards, then why is the BJP intruding before.      Earlier yesterday, Naidu reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to not politicise the issue of triple talaq and asserted that the controversial practice had no sanction in Shariat.      ""Triple talaq is a matter of right of equality and right of women to live with dignity. It should not be politicised. I appeal to all political parties to take a resolve to put an end to negative politics,"" he said, while addressing a press conference in Hyderabad.      Prime Minister Modi earlier on Saturday appealed to the Muslim community to find for proper solution to end the practice of triple talaq.      Addressing the Basva festival, he told the media, ""I believe people from Muslim community would come up to solve the issue of triple talaq and act as savior to the Muslim women in this crucial period.""      He further went on to say that there should be no discrimination in the country, adding that ' Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' was the motto of his government and it would fulfill the promises made to the people without any discrimination.

Singh told ANI whatever objections the Muslim law board is making are absolutely wrong      ""Why can it not be rewritten when practices like sati have been struck down? When India has taken strong measures to liberate women from child marriage and practices like sati then why would not married Muslim women be liberated from this derogatory practice called triple talaq. Here there is right to religion, but there are reasonable restrictions imposed by the Constitution on grounds of public order, morality and health. And is this morality that you kick a woman by saying triple talaq, when Sharia and Hadith itself state that the gap of triple talaq has at least to be one menstrual cycle each,"" Abha Singh told ANI.      ""When the Middle-east countries do not practice this triple talaq procedure then this triple talaq in wrong form cannot be practiced and made applicable in India just because in Shah Bano case, the Rajiv Gandhi government took a back foot. I think that is why the Muslim law board is emboldened to make such statements. However, Article 21 which is right to life and right to life means right to live with dignity and in such cases a woman's dignity is violated in such a derogatory and demeaning way when she is told  triple talaq and divorced,"" she added.      Stating that the objections which the Muslim law board has raised are without any merit, Singh said, ""It can be challenged because part three it is fundamental rights. You may have Article 19 which talks of your freedom, which talks of your religious freedom. But then there is something called 19(2) which says there can be restrictions of public order morality and health on religion, minorities have a right to practice their religion. Protect their religion, but still the Constitution is above it.""      ""Article 21 is the keystone and it overrules all other articles. So, does Article 14 equality before law and because married Muslim women  are denied equality before the law, that is why the part three what they are talking of is null and void, it cannot overrule article 14 which says  equality before law and equal protection of laws and here  married Muslim women are not getting equal protection of laws like women of other religions,"" she added.      The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Friday told the Supreme Court that ""personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms.""      Submitting its response in connection with the ongoing matter on the 'triple talaq' issue, the AIMPLB said, ""Personal laws cannot be challenged as violative of Part III of the Constitution.""      ""When serious discords develop in a marriage and husband wants to get rid of his  wife, legal compulsions and time consuming judicial process....in extreme cases husband may resort to illegal criminal ways of getting rid of her by murdering her. In such situations Triple Talaq is a better recourse,"" AIMPLB told the apex court.      ""Marriage is a contract in which both parties are not physically equal. Male is stronger and female is a weaker sex. Securing separation through court takes a long time deters prospects of remarriage,"" it added.      The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men's lust, but it is a social need.      ""Muslim women have right to divorce under Khula practice. Issues of Muslim Personal Law are raised in the Supreme Court are for Parliament for decide. The Uniform Civil code is a directive principle and not enforceable. The personal laws are protected by Article 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution as they are acts done in pursuance of a religion,"" it added.      The apex court had last week issued notice to the Central Government on the plea of a Muslim woman challenging the Constitutional validity of 'triple talaq' to end a marriage.      The petitioner Noor Jahan has sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.      In her petition, Jahan has asked whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have the custody of her children.      A batch of petitions is being heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and notices have already been issued to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and others. (ANI)"

""It is time for the country to move forward and abolish triple talaq to end the discrimination and have gender justice and equality before law. Articles 14 and 16 assure these things. It is time to move and go according to the Constitution and end this practice, which discriminates Muslim women,"" Naidu told ANI here.      On October 7, the Centre had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying that triple talaq is not an essential religious practice in Islam. ""Gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable, overarching constitutional values and can brook no compromise,"" the government said in an affidavit filed in the top court. The Muslim law board claimed that triple talaq is a 'personal law', and hence, cannot be modified by the Centre.      The government countered the claim of the Muslim law board and said, ""Practices of triple talaq, polygamy and nikah halala cannot be regarded as essential part of religion and hence get no protection under fundamental right to religion.""      Defending the Centre's opposition to the triple talaq system, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted that in a secular nation like India, women cannot be allowed to suffer such arbitrary and derogatory systems.      Listing out the Centre's three-fold stand which was given in response to the Supreme Court over certain petitions filed by Muslim women, Prasad told ANI that firstly, the issue concerns only and only about the dignity, non-discrimination of women, respect to them and gender justice and India being a secular country governed by a constitution, the abiding values of its constitution about gender justice, dignity of women needs to be respected. ""The second is, India is a secular country. Secularism is a basic structure of the Constitution. Can we, where we have got a secular India, allow the women to suffer a kind of a system which is derogatory and arbitrary?"" he said. Illuminating the third point, the union minister mentioned that in more than a dozen Islamic countries, ranging from Bangladesh to Syria and even Pakistan, matrimonial laws have been regulated by law, including triple talaq.      In August, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), in its reply to the petitions, had defended the validity of triple talaq, saying that if the practice is discontinued, a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her.      ""If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, the legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive,"" the AIMPLB's affidavit had stated.

“When a candidate provokes people in the name of religion, you can understand what is going on in this country. It is the responsibility of every leader to behave in an impartial manner after he wins. BJP has always tried to sow poison between Hindus and Muslims,” she said.
“After listening to the statement of Maneka Gandhi, I was in grief. We have never seen people as Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. It is their choice to cast vote for us or not. How can you say something like that,” she added.
Terming the election as a challenge, the Congress candidate said that she had never taken any election lightly.
“I am getting a very good response. I feel that people have anger and they have seen that has happened in the last five years. People are disappointed with the current government,” Dutt said.
She was here to campaign for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has fielded Poonam Mahajan from the seat against Dutt.
Muslims voters are said to be key to winning election from this seat. Their importance can be gauged from the fact that a few days ago, Shahnawaz Hussain campaigned for BJP candidate.

Notably, the Triple Talaq bill was taken up in the Parliament in August last year after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court termed unconstitutional the law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed a bill which proposes to make the practice of instant Triple Talaq an offence under the Indian Penal Code with the provision of three-year jail term for the erring husband. (ANI)"

""Whatever is mentioned in the holy Quran is absolutely correct. Why does the government need to interfere in the personal matter concerning husband and wife? I think there are a lot of other things for the government to do,"" said Shamila Ahmed a resident of Deoband.
""The issues of education of Muslim girl are a big issue. Even those Muslim girls who are well educated and have done their BA, MA and have even qualified NET are jobless. Due to which all their qualities and qualifications remain of no use,"" she added.
Another woman said that there are several issues that should be considered.
""There are numerous issues in front of us, the roads are not developed, there is the issue of education of Muslim women,  the issue of employment of Muslim women amongst many others,"" said the woman.
""Those who do get job only get jobs in private schools,"" she added.
On the issue of ""Triple Talaq"", she said:  ""It is our personal matter and no government needs to interfere. It is as per our Shariat and we cannot go against it and even do not want any improvement in it"".
'Triple talaq' is a customary practice, prevalent among Muslims, that dissolves a marriage when the husband says the word 'Talaq' thrice. The custom is criticized for being unilateral and biased against women.
Locals in Deoband said that ""Muslim community should not be used as a political tool during polls.""
""It is a peace-loving city. Politicians should provide better education and more employment opportunities for Muslims in the country. Everyone should be treated equally. Muslim community should not be used as a political tool during polls,"" said Mohammad Tariq.
""We don't want reservation but want that condition of those in Muslim community who are downtrodden and marginalized should improve"" he added.
While a shopkeeper Mohammad Saleem Ansari said that Muslim youth are not given jobs in Police and Army and unemployment is large among them.
""Nobody gives jobs to Muslim youth. They are not given a job in the Army or police. Unless there are jobs for us, our condition is not going to improve,"" said Ansari.
The Union Cabinet in February approved ""Triple Talaq"" ordinance.
The Triple Talaq Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on December 27 last year with 245 votes in favour and 11 against the Bill. The opposition parties want the Bill to be sent to the Select Committee of Parliament for further vetting, a demand which was rejected by the Centre.
However, an ordinance was re-promulgated in January this year as the revised Bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha where the government lacks a majority.
The Bill criminalises the practice of instant 'triple talaq' with a provision of three years imprisonment to the erring husband.

Outlining his government's commitment to make the country strong, prosperous and inclusive, Modi in his reply in the Lok Sabha to the motion of thanks to the President's Address to the joint sitting of the two houses of parliament, called upon all opposition parties to ""rise above political boundaries to create a new and modern India"".
He cited former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to emphasise on duties and not merely rights and said: ""there was need of a paradigm shift of moving from rights to duties"". He said it was also the duty of public representatives to create ""public awareness"" on the issue.
He invoked the Emergency of 1975 and said people had returned his government to power after testing it for the past five years.
Modi sought to distinguish the work culture of BJP from other parties, saying that the party stays away from negativity and believes in ""drawing a bigger line"" rather than erasing the line of its rivals.
Modi rejected Congress allegations that it was targeting Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.
Referring to speech of Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury who had accused Modi government of making allegations against top leaders to defame them and challenged it to arrest UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and President Rahul Gandhi, Modi said his government was being criticised for ""not putting (people) to jail"".
He said the country was not under Emergency and due process of law will be followed while continuing the attack on corruption.
""If you get bail, enjoy it,"" he said in a veiled reference to Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi.
Modi also accused the Congress leadership of not thinking ""beyond family"" and that only a few contributed to the national progress.
Challenging the Congress, he asked if it had praised late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee before 2004 or till 2014. ""You did not praise Narasimha Rao, was the name of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh taken during the debate. They do not think outside the family,"" he said.
""There are some people who feel only a few names contributed to national progress. They only want to hear those few names and ignore the others. We think differently, we feel each and every citizen has worked for India's progress,"" he said.
""You are riding high. I congratulate you. You can't see properly from a height, people on the ground look small. We do not believe in being on a high. We believe in connecting with the grassroots,"" he said.
He also used the anniversary of the imposition of Emergency to attack the Congress, saying it had killed the soul of the nation.
Referring to the Triple Talaq Bill, he said Congress can make up for two ""missed opportunities"" on the issue of women empowerment in the past.
""They first missed in 1950s when Uniform Civil Code was being debated and then after 35 years when Shah Bano case came up. Now is the third chance when they can support Triple Talaq Bill.
""There are reports that a Congress minister had said at the time when Shah Bano case was being debated in the country that 'upliftment of Muslims is not the responsibility of the Congress, if they want to lie in gutter, let them be',"" Modi said and added that the members of the main minority community need to made part of country's progress.
He targeted Congress over its criticism of `Make in India' initiative, and said that China exports arms while India was world's biggest arms importer.
Modi said the President's Address is the voice of how the government will fulfill the aspirations of common people.
""Where do we want to take the country, how we intend to take it, what will be the priorities, we have tried to present a roadmap. ""The great men of the country saw a dream of a powerful, prosperous, inclusive India. The demand of time, the expectation of people is that we do this with determination and with greater speed. In today's global atmosphere, India should not lose this opportunity. We can remove all obstacles to meet the aspirations,"" he said.
Referring to BJP-led NDA returning to power with greater majority, he said there was ""nothing more satisfying then to see your work being endorsed by people""
Modi said the dream of ruling BJP-led NDA government is not to reach heights but to stay connected to grassroots.
""Together we can deal with any challenges that come our way. We can overcome challenges if we all come together.
Modi, who was cheered by BJP members through his speech, said he does not think about elections in terms of who won and who lost. ""For me, what is satisfying is the opportunity to serve for 130 crore Indians and do work that has made a positive difference in the lives of our citizens.
Modi said his government will work towards creating jobs and give a boost to tourism.
He rejected Congress allegation that Prime Minister had negated contributions of previous governments and said he had praised work of all the prime ministers and parties in power in the past.
He said former President Pranab Mukherjee was honoured with Bharat Ratna during the NDA rule.
He urged people to observe 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and 70th anniversary of Independence in keeping with the ideals of freedom fighters.
He also urged people to take steps to conserve water. (ANI)"

They said that the party and the government had made preparations for the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019, for which the government had to bring ordinances.
The ruling alliance does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. Despite this, getting the bill passed has shown lack of opposition unity.
The government had last week succeeded in getting another contentious bill -- the RTI Amendment Bill -- passed in the Upper House of Parliament.
The Congress was keen on sending the Triple Talaq Bill to select committee but could not succeed in the division.
A BJP leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the leadership crisis in Congress following the resignation of Rahul Gandhi as party chief also helped the ruling group in managing things with ease.
BSP MP Satish Chandra Misra opposed the Triple Talaq Bill and demanded that it be referred to select committee. However, BSP MPs were not present during voting, creating a surprise.
When contacted, BSP MP Veer Singh said he was not there in the House as he had a pre-scheduled programme and the Parliament Session was extended.
The absence of some Samajwadi Party members during the voting also created a surprise.
Members of AIADMK and JD-U, an ally of BJP, staged a walkout. Some members of Congress, YSR Congress, TDP, and TRS, apart from about nine from SP and BSP, were not present during voting. NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel were also not present.
The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour and 88 against it.
A BJP leader said the team led by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi did ""best floor management in recent history"".

Addressing reporters after the Cabinet approved the Ordinance on Triple Talaq, the union minister said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made numerous attempts to take the Congress party on board but failed.
Slamming the United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the minister accused the Congress of indulging in vote bank politics.
""It is my serious charge with full sense of responsibility, that a distinguished woman leader is the ultimate leader of the Congress party, yet such a barbaric inhuman Triple Talaq curse was not allowed to be ended by a parliamentary law because of ambiguity and the vacillations of the Congress party,"" said Prasad.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi led-government approved the ordinance after it could not be tabled in the Rajya Sabha due to lack of consensus last month during the monsoon session of the Parliament even as the Union Cabinet had approved an amendment to the Bill.
The Ordinance is likely to kick off a controversy as the Congress party had opposed the ""criminalisation"" aspect in the Triple Talaq Bill.
Triple Talaq, or verbal divorce, is often practiced by a section in the Muslim community in India to instantly divorce their wives by uttering the word 'Talaq' three times.

The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, that seeks to criminalise the act of instant divorce among Muslims with a three-year jail sentence for men was finally introduced after a brief debate.
AIMIM member Salauddin Owaisi pressed for a division and the voting saw 186 members supporting the bill and 74 against. The voting had to be taken through paper slips as the newly-elected members have to be allotted seats and division numbers yet in the electronic voting system.
The bill, which was passed by the Lok Sabha in December last but lapsed in the Rajya Sabha after the dissolution of the Lower House, seeks to replace an ordinance issued by the government in February.
The government got introduction of the triple talaq bill as the first legislative business of the 17th Lok Sabha but it met with stiff opposition from Congress and Muslim Majlis at the introduction stage itself. 
They persisted with their opposition and Speaker Om Birla allowed a brief discussion before the voting. The new Speaker also got the first taste of ruckus in the House and intervened to bring order.
In his objections, Congress member Shashi Tharoor said ""The bill does nothing to improve the status of Muslim women.""
He contended that the Bill would supersede the existing civil and criminal laws and cannot claim exception under Art 15 of the Constitution.
Owaisi said the Bill was in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution in regard to fundamental rights. He said the measure was not in the interest of the Muslim women as how an arrested husband pay for her maintenance.
He also attacked the BJP questioning its ""love"" for Muslim women when it was not showing the same ""love"" for Hindu women in Kerala in the Sabarimala temple entry issue even after the Supreme Court verdict.
He said there was no need for a separate law after the Supreme Court had declared triple talaq as null and void. The Muslim women were also covered under the Domestic Violence Act, Section 125 of the Cr Procedure Code and the Muslim Marriage Act, he contended.
Repying to the objections, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad put up a stiff defence of the government move saying the issue was not of religion but of women.
""There is no religion, no prayers no rituals. It is about justice and rights of women. It is a matter of humanity. The rights of Muslim women will be protected. It is about justice and empowerment of women,"" he said.
""People have chosen us to make laws. It is our work to make laws. Law is to give justice to the victims of triple talaq,"" Prasad said.
 Referring to the opposition members' contentions, the Law Minister said Art 15 had a proviso that nothing in the article could prevent the government from making any speciai provisions for women.
He said even after the Supreme Court declaring the triple talaq practice as null and void, 31 FIRs have been filed against men for illegal divorce.
Prasad said 22 Islamic countries have regulatged instant divorce among Muslims.
Later, the minister told reporters outside that it was a matter of great distress that the Congress party has chosen to oppose the bill in Parliament and has not learnt lessons even after the huge defeat in the elections.
He said the Congress party has joined the likes of Owaisi as the Congress party had not opposed the bill in December last year. It had then walked out.
Prasad said it was distressing because the Congress was doing this when it had Sonia Gandhi, a woman, as its leader.
 Talking to reporters, Owaisi said the bill was unconstitutional and would be a great injustice against Muslim women if the Bill became law.
""Triple talaq Bill is unconstitutional. It is a violation of the Constitution's Article 14 and 15. We already have the Domestic Violence Act 2005, CrPC Section 125, Muslim Women Marriage Act. If Triple Talaq Bill becomes a law it will be even greater injustice against women,"" he told reporters outside the Parliament.
Voicing his opposition, Owaisi said, ""If a man gets arrested how will he give allowance from jail? The government says if a Muslim man commits this crime the marriage will remain intact and he will be jailed for three years if punished by the court. He will be jailed for three yrs but marriage will be intact. What law is Mr (Narendra) Modi forming?""
""I would like to ask him (Modi) what kind of justice is this that if such law is implemented on a non-Muslim man then he goes to jail for one year and a Muslim man goes to jail for three years,"" he added.
On being asked about his party's stand on the triple talaq Bill, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan said that they support what is written in the Quran.
 ""Our stand is similar to what is written in the Quran,"" he said.
""No religion has given more rights to women than Islam. 1500 years ago, Islam was the first religion to have given the right of equality to women. Today, we witness the lowest divorce rate and the lowest cases of violence on women in Islam. Women are not burnt or killed"", said Azam Khan, MP from Uttar Pradesh's Rampur Constituency.
""Triple Talaq is a religious issue not a political issue and nothing is more supreme for a Muslim than Quran. On marriage, on divorce, for everything, the Quran has clear instructions and we follow it"", he further added. (ANI)"

The Muslim body has claimed that any order against Triple Talaq would be an infringement on their right to follow and profess any religion.      It has also been contended that the petitions are based on an incorrect understanding of Muslim Personal Law. Any legislative reform, they say, must be sensitive to the cultural context of India, adding that reforms in other countries can't be applied to India. The next hearing in this case is likely to be on March 30.      Earlier this week, over a million Muslims from across India had signed a petition to end the controversial divorce practice of triple talaq.      The petition was started by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an Islamic organisation affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), adding that the positive response to the petition has been linked with the Bharatiya Janata Patry's recent success in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.      Several women have filed a petition before the apex court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice.      The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.      However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her.      Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that he favoured the discontinuation of 'triple talaq', stating that ""lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be destroyed by triple talaq.""      He also targeted the opposition for 'politicising' the issue and supporting a gender discriminatory practice to appease their vote banks. (ANI)"

""It was a matter of great distress that the Congress chose to oppose the introduction of Triple Talaq Bill. Earlier they had not opposed it. Last time they had walked out from the Lok Sabha. But today they were siding with the likes of Asaduddin Owaisi, who were opposing it,"" Prasad told reporters here.
The Minister said that it is painful to see the Congress party taking an anti-woman stand in the House on the Bill even when Sonia Gandhi is the Parliamentary party's chairperson.
""A woman leader like Sonia Gandhi ji is the leader of the Congress party. Yet the Congress party takes an anti-woman position in the Lok Sabha by opposing even the introduction of the Bill. I must say it is not only painful but deeply regrettable,"" he said.
Prasad reiterated that the issue was not an issue of religion but of women's empowerment and justice.
""We have always stated that the Triple Talaq is neither an issue of religion nor of prayer nor of any other communal consideration. It is a pure and simple issue of women's justice, dignity, and empowerment,"" he said.
The controversial Triple Talaq Bill was introduced on Friday in the Lok Sabha amid a huge uproar from the Opposition parties, which are against criminalising the offence.
The Opposition raised strong objections at the introduction of the Bill itself. After a brief discussion, the motion for tabling the bill was put to vote. As many as 186 members voted for the introduction of the Bill and 74 against.
Speaker Om Birla then allowed Prasad to introduce the Bill.
""The rights of Muslim women will be protected. It is about justice and empowerment of women. People have chosen us to make laws. It is our work to make laws. Law is to give justice to the victims of Triple Talaq,"" Prasad had said in the House.
There was a commotion in the Lok Sabha when the minister sought to introduce the Bill. The Speaker had to intervene to let the Minister speak on the Bill amid the ruckus.
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said the Bill does nothing to improve the status of Muslim women. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, on the other hand, argued that the Bill places the burden of proof on women.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to replace an ordinance by the government in February and to make instant triple talaq a penal offence.
Last year, The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, was passed in the Lok Sabha but it lapsed after the dissolution of previous Lok Sabha with the bill pending in the Rajya Sabha. (ANI)"

Addressing the debate on the Triple Talaq bill in the Lok Sabha today, Sawant said that despite the Supreme Court's verdict, the government implemented a legislation to abolish a practice of triple talaq.
""Similarly, the Supreme Court is saying that the Ram Temple issue is not urgent. But we can't stay quiet for long. The whole country is yearning for the construction of the temple. The daring you are showing in the triple talaq issue, show the same there (Ram Temple issue),"" Sawant said.
The Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit till January 2019. However, pressure is being mounted on the BJP to initiate construction of the temple in Ayodhya.

He further stated that his party had promised that the Article 370, which gives special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, will be abolished as soon as their government is elected to power.

Shumayala Javed, a national level champion for seven times, hails from Amroha district of Uttar Pradesh. She was married to Azam Abbasi, a resident of Lucknow's Gosaiganj area in 2014.      ""On February 9, 2014, I got married to Azam Abbasi. From the starting, my in-laws used to torture me for dowry. They used to exploit me. Every now and then, they used to ask for dowry from my father,"" Shumayala told ANI as her daughter kept crying waiting for her mother to take her into her arms.      Narrating her ordeal, she shares how her in-laws used to harass her post marriage.      ""In June 2014, my father gave them Rs. two lakh. For some time, they treated me well. My husband's sister even tried to put me on fire. In September, my father again deposited Rs. one lakh in their account,"" she said.      ""When they learnt that I was pregnant, they said they want a son and threatened me of dire consequences if I gave birth to a baby girl. They even conducted an ultrasound to know whether I was pregnant with a baby boy or a baby girl. When I was eight months pregnant, they dragged me out of their house,"" she added.      ""When my daughter was born, they left me stranded. My father took me to my in-laws afterwards but they threatened him as well. My father left me there. But my in-laws kept on abusing me, both physically and mentally. In April, my husband divorced me through triple talaq,"" she added.      She also alleged that no one helped her, not even the police or the administration.      Now, Shumayala, who has participated in All India championships for four times, is left with no option but to knock the doors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath demanding justice.      ""I have written a letter to the Prime Minister and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. I expect them to help me get justice. I urge the Prime Minister to help me in this grave situation. He should set an example for all such people, who divorce their wives through triple talaq,"" she said.      In his 'Mann ki Baat' program, Prime Minister Modi dubbed triple talaq as a ""bad social practice"", saying such practices can be ended by social awakening.      Thousands of Muslim women across the country have since formed pressure groups and spearheaded signature campaigns demanding the abolition of the practice.      The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) claims Shariat upholds the validity of triple talaq - under which a Muslim husband can divorce his wife by merely pronouncing the word ""talaq"" three times.      Talaq or divorce can be obtained in either of two ways. Under 'talaq-ul-sunnat', there has to be a three-month period called 'iddat' between the pronouncement of talaq by a husband and a lawful separation. But 'talaq-e-bidat' authorises a man to do so in a single sitting.      The AIMPLB has issued appeals to all maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday 'namaz' and emphasise on its implementation.      The board has made it clear that it will not tolerate any interference in the Shariat laws, and claimed that majority of the Muslims in the country do not want any change in their personal law.      Earlier this week, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister had called for an end to the practice of triple talaq and invoked the disrobing of Draupadi in the Mahabharata to emphasise his point. (ANI)"

The complainant has also submitted an audio record in her defence.
The victim told ANI that on November 28, she received a call from her husband, who first abused her and then later gave her triple Talaq.
Narrating her ordeal, the complainant told ANI, ""I got married to Mohammed Muzammil Shareef on 6 January 2017. Since then, I was staying with him and my in-laws. But after a month, my in-laws started harassing me for dowry. When I got pregnant my worried parents took me back.

Last month the accused was booked for allegedly demanding dowry.

The three-line whip is a strict instruction to the Members of Parliament from their respective party which necessitates their presence in the House and participates in the voting. Any breach of the whip has serious consequences including disciplinary action against the violators of the whip.
The fresh Triple Talaq Bill aims to make the practice of instant triple talaq among Muslims an offence under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) with the provision of three-year jail for the husband. The Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 17, will replace the ordinance issued by the Central government in September, banning the instant triple talaq.
With the Lok Sabha failing to function properly due to disruptions ever since the Winter Session began on December 11, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on last Friday had chaired a meeting of the Rules Committee during which law to punish erring members with disciplinary action was favoured.
In that meeting, while referring to Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's comments that his party was ready to discuss the instant Triple Talaq Bill on December 27, the Speaker had said: ""I believe that on 27th the House will function smoothly.""
The instant triple talaq was taken up in the Parliament in August last year after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the Apex Court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that Triple Talaq was an integral part of religious practice. (ANI)"

The petition filed by social activist Shahid Ali stated that though the Supreme Court had limited its judgment up to the declaration of triple divorce as unconstitutional and invalid, the government went many steps further and not only declared the pronouncement of Triple Talaq as void and illegal but also made the same a criminal offence. The step was taken without making any arrangement in the said Act for reconciliation between the Muslim husband pronouncing the Triple Talaq and his wife.
""The mere fact of not providing any measure for reconciliation between the Muslim husband pronouncing Talaq and his wife is ultra-vires to own statement of objects and reasons attached with the Act and also violative of the order of the apex court,"" the plea said. 
The litigant further stated that the present Act discriminates against Muslims also on the ground that instances of desertions would increase.
""In Indian society most of the aggrieved Hindu husbands on account of tough procedure of divorce, prefer to desert their wives and since desertion is no offence, therefore, they avoid the unhappy marriages, however, the Muslim husbands cannot desert their wives and also cannot go in adultery on account of commandment of Quran, therefore, it is submitted that the present Act will result in discrimination against Muslims,"" it read.
The Delhi HC court is likely to hear the plea next week. (ANI)"

""We do not support this bill as our party believes that if this bill is passed, it will create distrust among a particular community."" party member Rajiv Ranjan Singh said during the debate on the Triple Talaq Bill.
""Nobody wants to see a husband and wife getting separated but if such a situation occurs, a couple takes the decision after due consent and trust. You cannot take decisions on their behalf by imposing such a law."" Singh added.
He said instead of imposing such a law, the government should spread awareness among that particular community. The government should think of some other solution.
The Triple Talaq Bill was taken up for consideration and passage in the Lok Sabha on Thursday with Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad urging the House to pass it unanimously as it was a matter of ""justice, respect and dignity of women"" and not of politics and religion.
Prasad said that twenty Muslim countries had laws to regulate instant triple talaq and why should a secular country like India not have it.

The argument began when Sibal said that the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all.      ""Yes, you should not hear,"" replied Sibal.      Earlier today, Sibal asked the Supreme Court how a 1400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      Meanwhile, the bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre yesterday assured the apex court that it will come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq was upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.      Rohatgi also conveyed to the apex court bench that Triple Talaq violates Muslim women's right to equality within the community, and also within the country      Earlier in the hearing, the apex court refused to hear all the three cases of Polygamy, Nikah and Halala at once, saying it will focus on one matter at a time.      The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides Triple Talaq.      However, the top court said that they have limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing last Friday, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the apex court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether Triple Talaq is valid constitutionally.      Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposes the triple talaq practice and wants to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that triple talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.      A five-judge bench of the apex court further observed that it would not hear polygamy issue along with the triple talaq case.      Relentless debates on the validity and plausibility of this practice were instigated soon after one petitioner, Shayara Banu, challenged the Muslim personal law over instantaneous application of triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and nikah-halala.      Supporting the stance of ending the practice of triple talaq, the Allahabad High Court had earlier asserted that the rights of any person, including Muslim women, cannot be violated in the name of 'personal law'.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice ""unconstitutional.""      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional. It violates the rights of Muslim women,"" ruled the high court, adding that no personal law board was above the Constitution. (ANI)"

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], December 23 (ANI): Slamming Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Sujata Mondal has alleged that the party that abolished Triple Talaq is asking her husband Saumitra Khan to divorce her.
This comes after BJP leader and Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan sent a legal divorce notice to his wife Sujata Mondal who was earlier a BJP member but has now joined TMC. 
Speaking to ANI, when asked the reason for any problem in her relationship, Mondal said, ""When politics enter your personal lives, it becomes bad for the relationship. Saumitra is in the company of bad people from BJP who are trying to instigate him against me. The party that abolished Triple Talaq is asking Saumitra to divorce me today.""
Explaining her reason to leave the BJP and join TMC, Mondal said, ""I joined the party keeping in mind a political view, for respect and security, I left the BJP and joined the TMC.""
""I don't know how I am getting divorce notice. How my husband who is an MP of BJP and president of its Yuva Morcha was saying of giving me a divorce in an open press meet. This is the same party which is against Triple Talaq. And the MP of that party is giving me divorce only because I am changing my party,"" she said. 
""Still today I love Soumitra and regard him as my husband. I am still wearing Sindhoor (vermilion) of his name. Just because of party pressure and to establish a trust for his party, he is ending ten years of his relationship with me. Ours was a love marriage and how it can end in a day,"" the TMC leader said.

""One thing is that I am noticing that no leader from the BJP is asking him why he is giving divorce. One of Soumitra's relative is in TMC, then why he is not suggesting her husband to divorce her and ask her to leave the house. Why only he is acting against me,"" the TMC leader said.
""BJP should do something that my relationship with Soumitra is saved which the TMC is saying that your relationship will not be affected if you and your husband are in two different parties,"" she told ANI. 
""He is making a great sacrifice for the BJP. If the BJP comes to power in the state then I would like to see him as Chief Minister and myself as his wife,"" she added.
Khan's lawyer Sameer Kumar sent the notice on the former's behalf where it is mentioned that the marriage of Khan and Mondal was solemnised in July 2016 under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as per Hindu rituals and ceremonies.
The notice further says that Khan and his family were subjected to mental and emotional torture which increased beyond the level of tolerance and hence he wants to dissolve his marriage with Mondal.
The legal divorce notice further calls upon Mondal to execute the divorce under mutual consent under Section 13 (B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 within 30 days failing which Khan will be at liberty to file appropriate proceedings in a court of law. (ANI)"

The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring the Bill to the Select Committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against.
The BJP led NDA government, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, still managed to have smooth sailing for the contentious bill because parties like AIADMK, which has 11 members and JDU, with six, walked out after recording their opposition to the Bill. The BJD supported the Bill.
At least five members of the Congress, some from Trinamool Congress, SP, BSP and others belonging to parties like BSP, YSRCP, and TRS reportedly abstained from voting. NCP's Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel and Jharna Das Baidya of CPI(M) were also absent.
The Bill has already been passed by the Lok Sabha. With the approval of the Rajya Sabha, the Bill is all set to become an Act after the Presidential node.
The amendments moved by several opposition members were also defeated either by voting or by a voice vote.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019 criminalises instant triple talaq among Muslims and attracts a jail term of three years for the husband.
Soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu was to take up the Bill for its passage, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the entire opposition was for the empowerment of women but as far as the Bill was concerned, the opposition parties wanted some modification.
""This was the reason the opposition members moved some amendments. Our demand to refer the Bill to the Select Committee was rejected. We were expecting that the government would at least consider the opposition's demand to remove the criminality clause in the Bill which provides to send the husband to jail for three years for pronouncing triple talaq. But this demand was also rejected. So, in compulsion, we will have to vote against the Bill,"" he said.
After his remarks, the voting took place and the Bill was declared passed by the Chairman.
Earlier, replying to over four-hour-long debate, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the House did not need the mandate of the Supreme Court to pass a law.
He said that it has been brought to protect the rights of Muslim women and not to target any particular community.
Asserting that the Bill was for gender justice, dignity and equality, he said that the offence has been made compoundable and bailable in the Bill.
Prasad said that among the cases related to Triple Talaq which have come to light after the Supreme Court's judgment, 75 per cent of the victims is from poor families.
He questioned the Congress as to why fingers are being raised on the intent of the Bill, saying the Congress government during its rule made the provisions of imprisonment in the Hindu Marriage Act and Dowry Prohibition Act.
He said that a woman had recently approached him because her husband had given her triple talaq over WhatsApp.
""Should I tell these women that you frame the Supreme Court judgment? If they go to the police, they will be told that if there is no law, then they can't file an FIR. I am a minister in the Narendra Modi government and not the Rajiv Gandhi government. If there is a need for justice, we will bring a law for it,"" he said.
On Opposition parties questioning the jail term in the case of triple talaq, Prasad justified the move by citing the jail terms in anti-dowry law and for Hindu men marrying the second time.
""You spoke a lot today, Ghulam Nabi Azadji. You (Congress) won 400 seats in 1986. There have been nine Lok Sabha elections after that. You did not get a majority in any of them. Think why did that happen? You were 44 in 2014, 52 today. In 1986 you rose to 400. Shah Bano's case happened in 1986 and you never received a majority after that. I am giving you food for thought,"" he said.
Participating in the debate, Opposition parties stressed that the Bill needs to be referred to a Select Committee for further scrutiny.
While taking part in the debate the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Left parties opposed the Bill.
The NDA constituents AIADMK and the Janata Dal-United too opposed the Bill and staged a walkout. The YSRCP and the TDP too opposed the Bill whereas the Biju Janata Dal supported the Bill. (ANI)"

""The constitution is a temple. You cannot force anything. The country should run by the constitution, that is what we want. If that is not done it will be not good for the country,"" he said.

Pracha said the arguments given by the opposition shows that they have not studied the bill properly.
""Owaisi is saying that there is one-year punishment for men in other communities but Muslim men will get three years. I do not think there for men there is one-year punishment for divorce in any community. That punishment is under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and that itself is for violation of a protection order,"" he said.
However, he also criticised the bill. If anything, according to Mehmood Pracha, Owaisi as a Muslim leader should be very happy that certain protections are being made for Muslim women and he should rather criticize the government on the ground that the bill is not strong enough.
""Firstly, the bill does not take care of women in situations where Muslim men without uttering triple talaq throw out his wife. Secondly, women do not get any financial protection in this bill and matters like financial assistance should be decided by the magistrate within 5-7 days else women will get harassed in court for years without getting a single rupee in maintenance just like the provisions in section 125 in Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC,) and Domestic Violence Act (2005),"" he said.
""I think BJP can be successful in highlighting the wrong point of Muslim community or showing Muslim community down but it will not give anything to Muslim women,"" he added.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 was introduced on the first day of business in the newly formed 17th Lok Sabha. After its introduction, it met stiff opposition in the Parliament, most prominently from Congress and Muslim Majlis.
After a brief discussion, the motion for tabling the bill was put to vote. 186 members voted for introduction and 74 against.
In his objections, Congress member Shashi Tharoor said: ""The bill does nothing to improve the status of Muslim women."" He contended that the Bill would supersede the existing civil and criminal laws and cannot claim exception under Art 15 of the Constitution.
Asaduddin Owaisi, Member of Parliament from Hyderabad Constituency, asked how an arrested husband can pay for her maintenance and thus bill is not in the interest of Muslim women.
The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Owaisi, also contended that there was no need for a separate law after the Supreme Court had declared triple talaq as null and void. The Muslim women were also covered under the Domestic Violence Act, Section 125 of the Cr Procedure Code and the Muslim Marriage Act.
Replying to the objections, Law Minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad put up a stiff defense of the government move saying the issue was not of religion but of women.
""There is no religion, no prayers no rituals. It is about justice and rights of women. It is a matter of humanity. The rights of Muslim women will be protected. It is about justice and empowerment of women,"" he said.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to criminalize the act of instant divorce among Muslims with a three-year jail sentence. 
The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in December last year but lapsed in the Rajya Sabha after the dissolution of the Lower House. The current bill seeks to replace an ordinance for the same which was issued by the cabinet last February. (ANI)"

A five judge bench of the apex court further observed that it would not hear polygamy issue alongwith the triple talaq case.      The apex court is hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women rejecting the practice of triple talaq.      The  five-judge Constitution Bench of the apex court is headed by Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar and four other judges, namely Justices Kurian Joseph, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Uday Umesh Lalit and S. Abdul Nazeer.      Relentless debates on the validity and plausibility of this practice were instigated soon after one petitioner, Shayara Banu, challenged the Muslim personal law over instantaneous application of triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and nikah-halala.      Supporting the stance of ending the practice of triple talaq, the Allahabad High Court had earlier asserted that the rights of any person, including Muslim women, cannot be violated in the name of 'personal law'.      The court further said basic and human rights cannot be exploited on the basis of gender.      ""A Muslim husband cannot give a divorce in such a manner which would put a question mark on equal rights,"" the court observed.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice ""unconstitutional"".      The court further observed that triple talaq sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional. It violates the rights of Muslim women,"" ruled the high court, adding that no personal law board was above the Constitution. (ANI)"

Her reactions came after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), a Muslim body governing personal affairs according to Islamic Law Code Shariat, filed an affidavit in the apex court, stating that ""personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms"".      Speaking to ANI, Somen said AIMPLB is a male-dominated patriarchal body, which does not believe in women equality and justice for women.      ""We want triple talak to be abolished, because it is 'not Quranic' and it is not constitutional. The Quranic method of divorce is based on discussion of over a period of three months of attempt to reconciliation, attempt of mediation, failing which a divorce can happen. So triple talaq, as we are seeing today, is totally 'un-Quranic', that's why we want it to be abolished. The position that the personal law board has taken is not tenable as per the Constitution of India. Being Muslim women, they are entitled to Quranic justice, they are entitled to justice as citizen of India,"" she said.      She said Islam gives equal rights and equal justice to women and that is why they are fighting.      Echoing similar views, Javed Anand, a civil rights activist based in Mumbai, said the Muslim personal law board is a self constituted personal law body and cannot override fundamental rights in the name of religion, while pointing out that there are many Muslim countries where triple talaq and polygamy are banned.      ""The Indian Constitution has given fundamental rights to all its citizens. Non-discrimination and gender justice are part of those fundamental rights. In the name of religion, you cannot override other fundamental rights, as has been pointed out by the Bombay High Court. In a judgment concerning the Haji Ali dargah, the court cited several Supreme Court (SC) judgments in the past, where the issue of what constitutes an integral and essential part of any religion and what does not constitute,"" Anand said.      ""There are number of Muslim countries, where triple talaq is banned, polygamy is banned or severely retracted, hala practices have been declared unconstitutional, so it could be Muslims personal law boar's point of view,"" he added.      Meanwhile, Pramila Nesargi, another women activist, said Muslims are part and parcel of the country and they cannot ask to be treated separately.      ""Muslim women have a right to contest elections; they have right to live like citizens of the country; they have the right to live with dignity; how dignity could be given to a lady if she is being treated like vegetable, is she not a citizen, is she not a human being. She is bound by the law applicable to all women in the country. Why should there be a separate law regarding talaq, maintenance, marriage,"" she said.      Submitting its response in connection with the 'triple talaq' issue, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said, ""When serious discords develop in a marriage and husband wants to get rid of wife, legal compulsions and time consuming judicial process..in extreme cases husband may resort to illegal criminal ways of getting rid of her by murdering her. In such situations Triple Talaq is a better recourse.""      ""Marriage is a contract in which both parties are not physically equal. Male is stronger and female is a weaker sex. Securing separation through court takes a long time deters prospects of remarriage,"" it added.      The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men's lust, but it is a social need.      One of the petitioners Noor Jahan sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was unconstitutional as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.

The Bill, which was passed with 302 votes in favour and 82 against in a division, will now be tabled in Rajya Sabha, where the opposition is numerically higher than the ruling side.
Members of Congress, Trinamool Congress, and several other parties staged a walkout over the bill. BJP ally Janata Dal (United) also opposed the Triple Talaq Bill and walked out of the Lok Sabha saying it will create distrust among a particular community.
The Opposition members attacked the government saying it was singling out the Muslim men while diverse happened in other communities and there was no penal law for that against men of those communities.
""We do not support this bill as our party believes that if this bill is passed, it will create distrust among a particular community."" party member Rajiv Ranjan Singh said during the debate on the Triple Talaq Bill. ""Nobody wants to see a husband and wife getting separated but if such a situation occurs, a couple takes the decision after due consent and trust. You cannot take decisions on their behalf by imposing such a law."" Singh added.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to criminalize the act of instant divorce among Muslims with a three-year jail sentence for men who practice triple talaq, which has been made illegal by the Supreme Court.
Replying to a spirited day-long debate, Prasad the triple talaq legislation will act as a deterrent and the government had provided enough safeguards.
He said Congress governments had included penal provisions in Hindu Marriage Act and Dowry Prohibition Act and asked why the party dragged its feet in the Shah Bano case in 1986.
""It is being said in the House that triple talaq is bad but... Why this but. Why Congress' feet are not stable,"" he asked.
Referring to points made by some opposition members that there was no need of a law as Supreme Court had held triple talaq unconstitutional, he asked if the victims of triple talaq will get justice by merely 'hanging' the verdict of Supreme Court.
""There is a need of power of law to register an FIR. I am law minister of Narendra Modi government and not of Rajiv Gandhi government. If it had happened in 1986, the issue would not have been left to us,"" he said. 
Prasad said the Congress-led government had not taken a stance on a plea in court by a triple talaq victim but when the issue was taken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ""he told us to stand with the victims"". ""We did that,"" he said.
Prasad said over 20 Islamic countries have laws against triple talaq and why should a secular country like India not have it.
Referring to remarks of JD-U member, Prasad said that All India Muslim Personal Law Board had urged the Supreme Court in an affidavit not to interfere and had said it would preach in Muslim community against triple talaq. ""Did they do anything,"" he asked.
He said Prophet Muhammad had also held triple talaq as wrong.
Prasad said that triple talaq cases have continued even after the court verdict.
Referring to the safeguards, he said only a woman or her relative can file a complaint and there was a provision of bail and possibility of compromise.
Responding to members who had raised questions about the need of penal provisions, he said there were similar provisions in laws relating to other religions and a man can be jailed for second marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act.
""Penal law is also a deterrent. Deterrence was brought in Hindu society and it impacted cases of dowry and bigamy,"" he said. 
Referring to demand for law against mob lynching, he said people are being punished under existing laws. 
Prasad said the bill had been hailed by Muslim women.
""It is not about religion, vote, it is about justice, humanity, respect of women,"" he said.
Prasad said Modi government works without discrimination in spirit of `sabka saath, sabka vikas' and recalled Modi telephoning a tea garden worker Karimul Haque in West Bengal to tell him that he was being awarded Padma Shri for his social work.
He also recalled touching feet of wife of Param Vir Chakra winner Abdul Hamid.
 Prasad said stakeholders were Muslim women and not AIMPLB and the government was addressing their concerns. ""There is a time when voice of pain should be heard,"" he said.
 The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in December last year but lapsed in the Rajya Sabha after the dissolution of the Lower House. The current bill seeks to replace an ordinance promulgated last February.
Congress MP from Kishanganj, Mohammad Jawed opposed the Bill and said that the government should bring ""laws for separated women of all communities"" and not just Muslims.
""The Bill which has been tabled is another way to jail Muslims... I oppose this Bill and request the minister to send this Bill to the standing committee for review and make laws for separated women of all communities, not just Muslims,"" he said.
AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi said that the Supreme Court has decriminalised homosexuality and adultery, but the government was criminalising triple talaq.
N K Premachandran termed the bill ""politically motivated"" to target a particular community and e asked why the government has not come with legislation against mob lynching.
IUML's P.K. Kunhalikutty accused the government of pursuing a ""political agenda"".
BJP members Meenakshi Lekhi and Poonam Mahajan and union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi also participated in the debate. (ANI)"

32-year old Ruby had approached the top court to declare the Talaq issued by her husband illegal.
The woman said her husband had thrown her out of the house and issued two notices of Talaq in a violation of the top court's judgement and Triple Talaq ordinance.
A Bench of Indira Banerjee and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said it will hear the case on Friday after the woman's counsel mentioned the matter for urgent hearing.
Speaking to ANI, the petitioner Ruby Mansoori said, ""I request the court to give me justice. Talaq that was given by my husband is illegal. I should be allowed to stay back with him. Where will I go with my kids?""
The 32-year-old alleged that her in-laws used to thrash her for not giving dowry. ""They demanded Rs 5 lakh and a car from me, but when I failed to provide it, they threw me out of the house on March 19. After that my husband sent me a divorce notice on March 25,"" she said.
MM Kashyap, appearing on the behalf of Ruby, told ANI that he has prayed in the petition to cancel the divorce notice. 
The petition said the Talaq given to her was against the 'Triple Talaq' judgement of the apex court.
'Triple talaq' is a customary practice, prevalent among Muslims, that dissolves a marriage when the husband says the word 'Talaq' thrice. The custom is criticised for being unilateral and biased against women.
The Triple Talaq Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on December 27 last year with 245 votes in favour and 11 against the Bill. The opposition parties want the Bill to be sent to the Select Committee of Parliament for further vetting, a demand which was rejected by the Centre.
However, an ordinance was re-promulgated in January this year as the revised Bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha where the government lacks a majority.
The Bill criminalises the practice of instant 'triple talaq' with a provision of three years imprisonment to the erring husband.
The issue of triple talaq was taken up in the Parliament in August last year after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled ""unconstitutional"" a practice that allows Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In February, the Union Cabinet had approved ""Triple Talaq"" ordinance.

On Thursday, the Cabinet proposed three changes in the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill, 2017 - first, only the victim, a blood relation or relation by marriage are allowed to lodge FIR in the case, second, the case can be dropped if husband and wife agree to settle their differences and third, a magistrate can grant bail to men found guilty of giving instant Triple Talaq to their wives. However, the offence still remains non-bailable.
After the bill would be passed in the Upper House, it would go back to Lok Sabha for approval of the amendments. On December 29 the Lok Sabha passed the bill, which sought to make instant triple talaq a criminal offence.

The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce triple talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      The board's reply came after Chief Justice of India (CJI) Jagdish Singh Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it was possible to give bride the right to not accept instant triple talaq.

Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposed the triple talaq practice and wanted to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that Triple Talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court earlier observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been accusing the Congress of stalling the passage of the landmark Bill which was passed in the Lok Sabha on December 29, 2017. The Bill is yet to be introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The BJP's aim was to get the Bill passed in the Budget Session which commenced on January 29 and adjourned sine die on April 6. The Congress-led Opposition, however, has demanded that the Bill should be sent to the Select Committee for further scrutiny.
On August 9, the Cabinet proposed three amendments in the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill, 2017. The changes proposed are, firstly only the victim, a blood relation or relation by marriage are allowed to lodge FIR in the case; secondly, the case can be dropped if husband and wife agree to settle their differences and thirdly, a magistrate can grant bail to men found guilty of giving instant Triple Talaq to their wives. However, the offence still remains non-bailable. After the Bill is passed in the Upper House, it would go back to the Lok Sabha for approval of the amendments.
The draft of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2017, also known as the Triple Talaq Bill, says, ""Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal"".
The Bill proposes a three-year jail term for a Muslim man who divorces his wife in any form of spoken, written or by electronic means such as email, SMS, and WhatsApp. (ANI)"

The House has not been functioning properly ever since the Winter Session began on December 11, as members from some parties have been creating uproar over various issues.
The issue of triple talaq was taken up in the Parliament in August last year after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the top court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that Triple Talaq was an integral part of religious practice.
The Triple Talaq Bill was taken up earlier this year in the House during the Monsoon Session of Parliament. However, owing to lack of consensus, the Bill could not be passed.
Subsequently, an ordinance was passed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet in September.
On Monday, a fresh Bill which prohibits divorce of Muslim couples by pronouncing 'talaq' (divorce) three times by their husbands, was first introduced in the Lok Sabha to replace the ordinance issued in September.

Her reaction came after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) filed an affidavit in the apex court, stating that ""personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms"".      Defending the validity of triple talaq before the Supreme Court, the AIMPLB had earlier said that a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her if the practice is discontinued.      The board also said that divorce proceedings instead of triple talaq could damage a woman's chances of re-marriage if the husband indicts her of loose character in the court.      The AIMPLB also asked the Supreme Court to keep its hands off the issue, saying that principles of marriage, talaq and polygamy are interwoven with religious and cultural rights of Muslims, which cannot be touched upon by any court on the ground of violation of fundamental rights.      The AIMPLB further said that polygamy as a social practice is not for gratifying men's lust, but it is a social need. (ANI)"

Speaking to ANI here, Swamy opined that there is a ""wrong impression"" that freedom of religion is absolute and further elaborated, that under Article 25 of the Constitution, it says that freedom of religion is subject to some reasonable restrictions, which are due to morality, public order and health.      ""So where is the question of talaq? It is an immoral thing. Because through that, what you are saying is men can divorce a woman who is totally dependent on him and bring to her to the streets by saying talaq three times.

The Centre's four-point suggestion was a response to the top court's call on Tuesday for pointed questions of law on triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy that the court should discuss.      Several women have filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice. The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.      One of the petitioner's Shayara 38, stirred a hornet's nest after she moved the Supreme Court to challenge the triple talaq under Muslim personal law, under which a man simply has to utter 'talaq' thrice to divorce his wife.      Shayara has also challenged in the apex court the concept of 'nikah-halal', under which a woman must consummate another marriage in order to go back to her first husband if she wants to. She also wants to outlaw polygamy within a Muslim marriage.

The five judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), Jagdish Singh Khehar and four other judges Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Kurian Joseph, Uday Umesh Lalit and S. Abdul Nazeer, reserved the order after hearing in great detail from all the parties - from various petitioners and respondents and the Central government for six consecutive days during the summer vacation session.      The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the apex court that marriage in the Muslim community is a contract and in order to protect their interests, they can put special emphasis on certain clauses in 'nikahnama'. The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce triple talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      The board's reply came after CJI J.S. Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it was possible to give bride the right to not accept instant triple talaq.      The board also showed the court a resolution passed on April 14, 2017 which stated triple talaq as a sin and that the community should boycott the person doing such an act. While Sibal earlier said the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all. ""Yes, you should not hear,"" replied Sibal. Earlier, Sibal asked the top court as to how a 1400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      The bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on the WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre, during the earlier hearing, assured the apex court that it would come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq is upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.

""It's a matter of human rights, so we would deal with it properly,"" the court said.      The apex court also said that it would pass an order and dispose off the petitions on May 11, regarding the validity of triple talaq case.      A bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice of India, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar said so after hearing the plea filed by one Shayara Banu, who had moved the apex court challenging the validity of triple talaq.      Several women have filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice. The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.      One of the petitioner's Shayara 38, stirred a hornet's nest after she moved the Supreme Court to challenge the triple talaq under Muslim personal law, under which a man simply has to utter 'talaq' thrice to divorce his wife.      Shayara has also challenged in the apex court the concept of 'nikah-halal', under which a woman must consummate another marriage in order to go back to her first husband if she wants to. She also wants to outlaw polygamy within a Muslim marriage.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice as unconstitutional.      The court further observed that the triple talaq practice sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional, it violates the rights of Muslim women,"" ruled the High Court, adding that no personal law board is above the Constitution.      However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her. The rights bestowed by religion can't be questioned in a court of law, it said. (ANI)"

""No Indian Muslim woman would have ever gone to the court if the Muslim Personal Board had actually sat down and said yes there is a problem and said that they will sit and try to find out a solution,"" she told ANI.      Her reactions came after the AIMPLB, a Muslim body governing personal affairs according to Islamic Law Code Shariat, filed an affidavit in the apex court, stating that ""personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms.""      She said that the solution to the triple talaq problem is that it should be counted as one talaq but not the final divorce.

""No Muslim woman is questioning Sharia. No Muslim woman is questioning any of the things written in the Quran. With all respect to Quran, we love Islam.

""What the Personal Law Board is trying to say is absolutely right when they say that the court does not intervene as far as Personal Law is concerned, but, at the same time they do not acknowledge that Indian Muslim women are facing problems,"" she said.

There are very few women as compared to men within the board,"" said the former NCW member.

The AIMPLB on Friday told the Supreme Court that ""personal laws cannot be re-written in the name of social reforms"" as the board submitted its response in connection with the ongoing matter on the 'triple talaq' issue.

The Triple Talaq Bill makes the practice of instant divorce among Muslims a criminal offence with a provision of three-year jail term for the erring husband. The bill was passed in Lok Sabha with the support of 245 votes against 11 on December 27.
Claiming that the bill will break marriages and that it is not going to help the Muslim women in any way, AIMPLB Women Wing Chief Organiser Dr Asma Zohra told ANI, ""We oppose and condemn Triple Talaq Bill which is likely to be tabled for the second time in Rajya Sabha tomorrow (Wednesday).

Zohra further criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not replying to AIMPLB president Maulana Rabe Hasani Nadvi's letter regarding the loopholes in the bill.
""Rather than this bill, there are several burning issues in our country that seek attention. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has no courtesy to reply to a letter from the representative of 20 crore Muslim population. The government cannot take us for granted.

""Nobody wants to see a husband and wife getting separated but if such a situation occurs, a couple takes the decision after due consent and trust. You cannot take decisions on their behalf by imposing such a law."" Singh added.
 The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to criminalize the act of instant divorce among Muslims with a three-year jail sentence for men who practice triple talaq, which has been made illegal by the Supreme Court.
Replying to a spirited day-long debate, Prasad the triple talaq legislation will act as a deterrent and the government had provided enough safeguards. 
The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in December last year but lapsed in the Rajya Sabha after the dissolution of the Lower House. The current bill seeks to replace an ordinance for the same which was issued by the cabinet last February. (ANI)"

The Prime Minister said, ""The conduct of Kerala LDF government on Sabarimala issue will go down in history as one of the most shameful behaviours by any party and government. We knew that communists do not respect Indian history, culture, and spirituality but nobody imagined that they will have such hatred.""

He further stated that the BJP has always supported the people of Kerala, adding that the people and their aspirations are a matter of conviction for his party.
""Left and Congress make tall claims about respect to gender justice and social justice but their actions are exactly the opposite. The NDA government is working towards abolishing the Triple Talaq. Who is opposing us on this? Communists and the Congress,"" Prime Minister Modi said.
""A few days ago, our government had the historic opportunity to pass legislation that gives 10 per cent quota to poor people from the general category. We believe that every Indian, irrespective of caste, creed or community deserves equal opportunity,"" the Prime Minister added.
While saying that the UDF and the LDF are two sides of the same coin, Prime Minister Modi said that both are the same in terms of corruption, casteism, communalism, ignoring the poor and political violence.
With the General Elections on the horizon, the Prime Minister's rally is construed as a part of the BJP's focus on increasing their tally of Lok Sabha seats in the state, as the party looks to retain power for the next five years.
Kerala has been dominated by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M)-led LDF and the Congress party led-UDF for the past two decades and has traditionally not been one of the BJP's strongholds.

Thousands of Muslim women across the country have since formed pressure groups and spearheaded signature campaigns demanding the abolition of the practice.      The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) claims Shariat upholds the validity of triple talaq - under which a Muslim husband can divorce his wife by merely pronouncing the word ""talaq"" three times.      Talaq or divorce can be obtained in either of two ways. Under 'talaq-ul-sunnat', there has to be a three-month period called 'iddat' between the pronouncement of talaq by a husband and a lawful separation. But 'talaq-e-bidat' authorises a man to do so in a single sitting.      The AIMPLB has issued appeals to all maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday 'namaz' and emphasise on its implementation.

""We have introduced a provision to the same effect in the Parliament according to their (Muslims) sentiments and institutions. We do not disrespect religious sentiments of anyone, we act according to the constitution which ensures equal rights for all,"" PM Modi said.
The Prime Minister alleged that Opposition parties were not letting the law pass in the Parliament.
""Congress and its allies are forcing the sisters to live in fear of triple talaq. They are trying to stall the triple talaq bill,"" he said.
PM Modi assured the gathering that he would not let 'mahamilavatis' (highly adulterated), as he called the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, succeed in their endeavours to stall the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 in the Parliament.
He attacked Congress president Rahul Gandhi over a revelation recently made in a media report which questioned Gandhi's role in a defence deal when UPA was in power at the Centre.
The Prime Minister said: ""A few days ago, it was exposed by the media that Congress' 'naamdaar' (a reference to Gandhi) helped his close friend get a defence deal (during previous UPA regime). But he never cared about providing electricity, houses and toilet to people.""
The Prime Minister dubbed the designation of Pakistan-based terrorist Masood Azhar a global terrorist as a major success for India.
He alleged that the leaders of the grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh do not acknowledge India's diplomatic feat.
""Everyone was proud of India's success in getting Azhar declared a global terrorist. But what shall I do to the 'mahamilavatis' who are not ready to acknowledge the success of India in designating Masood Azhar a global terrorist?"" Modi questioned.
Keeping his attack centred on SP-BSP-RLD, he accused the alliance leaders of being corrupt, who amassed large amounts of money when they were in power.
""What was the condition of SP, BSP (leaders) some decades ago? And what lavish lives they live now!"" PM Modi said.
He went on to praise himself, saying, ""I am a living example in front of you. I have been CM for a long time. Is there any blot on my image? Does anyone talk about the property? Does anyone talk about my farmhouse, any bungalow abroad? Have you heard I did anything for my family?""
""In just five years, even their distant aides become rich,"" he added.
Polling for the fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections will take place on Monday. Counting of votes for all seven phases will begin on May 23. (ANI)"

CPI national secretary D.

""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      Meanwhile, the bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre yesterday assured the apex court that it will come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq was upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.

The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides Triple Talaq.      However, the top court said that they have limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing last Friday, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the apex court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether Triple Talaq is valid constitutionally.      Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposes the triple talaq practice and wants to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that triple talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.      A five-judge bench of the apex court further observed that it would not hear polygamy issue along with the triple talaq case.      Relentless debates on the validity and plausibility of this practice were instigated soon after one petitioner, Shayara Banu, challenged the Muslim personal law over instantaneous application of triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and nikah-halala.

Just like if any Hindu commits female feticide he will have to go to jail, similarly what is the crime of my Muslim sisters that someone says talaq over phone and her life is destroyed,"" he added.      Urging TV news channels to not turn triple talaq into an issue of Hindu versus Muslim or BJP versus other parties, Prime Minister Modi said that the Centre had in its submission to the Supreme Court clearly stated that there should not be any atrocities on women and there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion.      ""In a democracy, there should be discussion. The government has put forward its position. Those who want to digress from triple talaq are instigating the people.The lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be ruined by triple talaq,"" he said.      The Centre had earlier on October 7 filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on triple talaq and polygamy validity.      According to the affidavit, the Centre said that there is no reason women in India should be denied their constitutional rights.

Amid a walkout by some Opposition parties, the bill was passed in Lok Sabha with the support of 245 votes against 11 on Thursday.
Reportedly, both Congress and BJP have asked their members to present in the Upper House during the discussion and debate on the contentious Triple Talaq bill.
Calculating the Lok Sabha's environment during the passing of the bill, it seems that some opposition parties are likely to show resistance against the bill and stick to their demand of sending it to a  Joint Select Committee for proper assessment.
The government brought the measure after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court termed as unconstitutional the practice that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives by simply uttering the word 'talaq' three times in quick succession. Also, police have registered hundreds of complaints made by the affected women against the practice.
Elaborating about the bill in the Lower House, Prasad said: ""The bill makes the offence of instant Triple Talaq compoundable, which means that the case can be withdrawn if the man and his estranged wife reach a compromise.""
The Law Minister further emphasised that the bill was ""not against any community, religion or belief,"" adding that twenty Islamic nations have banned Triple Talaq, then why can't a secular nation like India?
Some Opposition parties, including the Congress, AIADMK and TMC, had staged a walk out of the House just before the bill was put to vote as their demand for sending it to a Joint Select Committee was not accepted.
However, other Opposition parties like RSP, AIMIM and BJD did not walk out of the House but moved some amendments which were negated.
BJD leader B Mahtab appreciated the government for toning down the provisions in the initial legislation.
Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the bill should be sent to a Joint Select Committee of Parliament for a detailed assessment. He suggested that such a committee could be asked to submit its report within 15 days.
""This is a very important bill which needs detailed study. It is also a constitutional matter. I request the bill be sent to joint select committee"" he added.
Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay also pressed for sending the bill to a Select Committee, as did AIADMK's P Venugopal.
Samajwadi Party's Dharmendra Yadav said Triple Talaq was a social issue and the BJP was trying to politicise the matter.
NCP's Supriya Sule also said that the issue was social and should not be converted into a political issue. (ANI)"

Talking to reporters after the release of 9th white paper on 'Industry, Employment and Skill Development' in the state, Chief Minister Naidu said: ""A separate law should not be made to target Muslims. They should be treated under normal judicial process. We are asking the government to send the bill to the Select Committee of Parliament.""
The legislation, which makes the Triple Talaq practice a criminal offence with a provision of a three-year jail term for the erring husband, replaces an Ordinance issued by the Central government in September 2018.
It was passed by the Lower House of Parliament last week after the Central government asserted that it should not be seen from the prism of politics as 20 Islamic countries have already banned the practice and not secular India.
Reiterating his call for special status to Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister Naidu further said that industries in the state will be benefited if special status was given by the Centre.
""Post-bifurcation, agriculture sector in the state increased considerably. We achieved 10.5 per cent growth rate in industries. Higher growth rate should be achieved in industries and service sectors. Only then the per capita income will increase. We are working in that direction,"" he said.
Launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led Central government, the TDP supremo alleged that grants were not allotted for Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor, while the government invested in the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which he said was a 'betrayal.'
""The Centre did not fulfill the re-organisation assurance of setting up a green-field petrochemical corridor. They did not fulfill the assurance of setting up a steel factory at Kadapa. We are developing food processing industries and focusing on skill development. Tourism is crucial in the service sector. Health tourism and education tourism are important growth engines,"" he said.
""Before 2014, Andhra Pradesh was lagging behind in manufacturing growth rate for ten years, which was less than the national average. The state could not get the financial incentives given to the special status states. During 2009-14, only Rs 312 crore per annum was released for industrial incentives. After 2014, the figures rose four times and became Rs 1,218 crore per annum,"" added Naidu.
""The Centre is not setting up the petrochemical corridor at Kakinada. We are taking the initiative. The Centre said it will establish an IT corridor in Visakhapatnam, but did not keep its promise. We will develop Bhavanapadu, Krishnapatnam and Machilipatnam ports as state ports,"" said Naidu.
The Chief Minister further said that a special corporation has been set up for MSMEs, while loans amounting to Rs 82,097 crore have been given to MSMEs during 2014-18. ""Many companies are coming to the state in the areas of food processing, jute, automobile, pharmaceuticals, and tourism sectors.

Pandey further said that she is devoted towards the protection of these victims and would happily work for their betterment.      However, earlier on Tuesday, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) vice-president Kalbe requested the Government to not interfere in the matter of Triple Talaq, adding the Muslim board would eradicate this evil themselves.

The High Court also stated that the form of 'instant divorce' is 'most demeaning'.      The Supreme Court is to hear multiple pleas challenging the validity of triple talaq, 'nikah halala' and polygamy practices among Muslims community on May 11 by a Constitution bench during the summer vacation.      Earlier on March 27, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the apex court that the pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.

A bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice of India, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar said so after hearing the plea filed by one Shayara Banu, who had moved the apex court challenging the validity of triple talaq.

Shayara has also challenged in the apex court the concept of 'nikah-halal', under which a woman must consummate another marriage in order to go back to her first husband if she wants to. She also wants to outlaw polygamy within a Muslim marriage.

In August last year, the Centre revoked Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the region into two Union Territories- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.
On the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370, from July 28 to August 3, BJP state units have been asked to hold a rally and connect to people in their regional language. The party has also planned a virtual rally at the national level.
One national office bearer of the party will attend programmes in Jammu, Srinagar, and Ladakh on August 5, according to a letter written by BJP national general secretary Arun Singh.

""Nikah Halala is a practice which is nothing, but rape of a woman. A woman once divorced by her husband can't reconcile with him until she marries another man and develops a sexual relationship with him. Even then, if she wants to reconcile with her husband, the other man has to give her a divorce. It is physical abuse without the consent of the woman,"" Maliwal said in the letter.
""In many cases, it is seen that the second man refuses to give divorce and she is forced to live with him. This is a vicious cycle of torture and trauma for the woman entailing nothing, but physical and mental abuse,"" she added.
While requesting PM Modi to include the provisions criminalizing Nikah Halala and Polygamy in the Triple Talaq bill which has been introduced in the Lok Sabha, Maliwal said, ""Not just Triple Talaq, but Nikah Halala and Polygamy are also extremely cruel practices that affect a large section of our society.""
She added, ""DCW comes across several women facing the brunt of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy on a daily basis and immeasurable pain of these women cannot be expressed.""

Terming polygamy as an 'assault on the right to equality for women', she said, ""Polygamy is another cruel practice in which Muslim man is allowed to keep four wives at the same time. It seems that women hardly matter and are not given the basic respect a human being deserves. These practices are an assault on the right to equality for women guaranteed by the Constitution.""

Chief Justice of India T S Thakur, who also leads the bench that has been hearing petitions on the validity of triple talaq and polygamy, will head the seven-judge bench.      Several Muslim women have approached the judiciary and the apex court is presently hearing three petitions against triple talaq.      Muslims organizations, however, perceive this development as an attempt to meddle with their religious practices and are boycotting the process.      Earlier the Centre had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying that triple talaq is not an essential religious practice in Islam.      ""Gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable, overarching constitutional values and can brook no compromise,"" the government said in an affidavit filed in the top court.      The Muslim law board claimed that triple talaq is a 'personal law', and hence, cannot be modified by the Centre.      The government countered the claim of the Muslim law board and said, ""Practices of triple talaq, polygamy and nikah halala cannot be regarded as essential part of religion and hence get no protection under fundamental right to religion.""      Defending the Centre's opposition to the triple talaq system, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted that in a secular nation like India, women cannot be allowed to suffer such arbitrary and derogatory systems.      Listing out the Centre's three-fold stand which was given in response to the Supreme Court over certain petitions filed by Muslim women, Prasad told ANI that firstly, the issue concerns only and only about the dignity, non-discrimination of women, respect to them and gender justice and India being a secular country governed by a constitution, the abiding values of its constitution about gender justice, dignity of women needs to be respected.      ""The second is, India is a secular country. Secularism is a basic structure of the Constitution. Can we, where we have got a secular India, allow the women to suffer a kind of a system which is derogatory and arbitrary?"" he said.      Illuminating the third point, the union minister mentioned that in more than a dozen Islamic countries, ranging from Bangladesh to Syria and even Pakistan, matrimonial laws have been regulated by law, including triple talaq.      In August, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), in its reply to the petitions, had defended the validity of triple talaq, saying that if the practice is discontinued, a man could murder or burn his wife alive to get rid of her.      ""If there develops serious discord between the couple, and the husband does not at all want to live with her, the legal compulsions of time-consuming separation proceedings and expenses may deter him from taking the legal course. In such instances, he may resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning her alive,"" the AIMPLB's affidavit had stated. (ANI)"

Addressing a rally after laying the foundation stone of Talcher Fertilizer Plant, Prime Minister Modi said that even though the Opposition created a hurdle in the Upper House of Parliament, his government was committed to saving the ""Muslim sisters and daughters from the clutches of social injustice.""
""Three days ago, the central government took a decision that was needed since decades. The decision was on Triple Talaq. No one was ready to even talk about it due to fear of losing votes. Now, it has been declared illegal,"" the Prime Minister said.
On September 19, the Union Cabinet approved an ordinance on Triple Talaq Bill, making instant talaq a criminal act. The government approved the ordinance after it could not be tabled in the Rajya Sabha due to lack of consensus last month during the monsoon session of Parliament.
Speaking at the event about the fertilizer plant, he said the construction of the plant, picked up speed only after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government came to power at the Centre.
While vowing to complete the plant in next 36 months, he termed the delay of the project a ""failure of previous government.""
Setting a tone for the upcoming assembly poll in Odisha which is due for next year, Prime Minister Modi attacked Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and said, ""I had urged the Chief Minister that Odisha will be left behind in cleanliness.

Addressing an election rally in Bhagalpur, he said the state was moving ahead with determination towards self-reliance and if parties in opposition get a chance to come back to power, the progress of the state will be slowed down.
He said every vote should be cast for NDA parties in the state under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. 
""The vote in Bihar is clearly in favour of alliance of BJP, JD-U, HAM and VIP led by Nitishji. Wherever I went, the mood that I am seeing, the people of the state have taken a pledge to make Nitishji Chief Minister again,"" he said. 
""Those standing against NDA today, they are opposing every decision in the interest of the country. They are against the decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, against decision on law against triple talaq to give rights to Muslim women,"" he added. 
PM Modi said parties opposed to NDA were ""against the growth of the country"".
The Prime Minister accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers and said it is the NDA government which implemented the recommendation to give MSP to farmers at one-and-a-half times the input cost.
""It is the NDA government that has laid great emphasis on both government procurement centres and government procurement,"" he said.
The Prime Minister also took swipe at Lalu Yadav's tenure as Chief Minister and said Bihar was pushed into ""a quagmire of chaos and disorder"".
""Today, at the root of many problems of Bihar is the chaos and misrule of the nineties. But now you are seeing a new Bihar being built. The need for lanterns in Bihar is over now.""

PM Modi also appealed to go local during this festive season to support artisans and move towards Atmanirbhar Bihar.

""No doubt that Triple talaq is very difficult for women but there is a board for Islamic law. The board must think about this issue instead of deciding it in the Supreme Court or in other courts. The Board is never above of Sharia but they can look into it and can make changes if needed for betterment of women,"" Farooq Abdullah said.      Earlier in the day, after asserting that Triple Talaq cannot be branded as unconstitutional, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal said the Supreme Court should be hearing the matter in the first place.      The argument began when Sibal said that the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all.      Sibal asked the apex court how a 1,400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      Meanwhile, the bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre yesterday assured the apex court that it will come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq was upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.      Rohatgi also conveyed to the apex court bench that Triple Talaq violates Muslim women's right to equality within the community, and also within the country.      Earlier in the hearing, the apex court refused to hear all the three cases of Polygamy, Nikah and Halala at once, saying it will focus on one matter at a time.      The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides Triple Talaq.      However, the top court said that they have limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing last Friday, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the apex court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether Triple Talaq is valid constitutionally.      Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposes the triple talaq practice and wants to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that triple talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.      A five-judge bench of the apex court further observed that it would not hear polygamy issue along with the triple talaq case.      +      Relentless debates on the validity and plausibility of this practice were instigated soon after one petitioner, Shayara Banu, challenged the Muslim personal law over instantaneous application of triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and nikah-halala.      Supporting the stance of ending the practice of triple talaq, the Allahabad High Court had earlier asserted that the rights of any person, including Muslim women, cannot be violated in the name of 'personal law'.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice ""unconstitutional.""      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional.

""Triple talaq is not an issue of religion, faith. It is only an issue of gender justice, dignity and equality. It is acting as a deterrent in the country,"" he said.
""22 Islamic countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have regulated triple talaq. But in India people are raising the issue of secularism and communalism. The Supreme Court has set it aside. Lok Sabha has passed it. Yet triple talaq is going on (in states) including in Telangana and UP. This is not fair,"" he added.
Prasad also urged United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chief Sonia Gandhi, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to extend their support to the government for the passage of the Triple Talaq Bill in the Rajya Sabha.
Triple talaq, or verbal divorce, is practised by some in the Muslim community to instantly divorce their wives by uttering talaq three times.

Owaisi alleged that Triple Talaq will bring Muslim women to the roads and will ruin them and to put Muslim men behind the bars.
""This law is to bring only Muslim women to the roads, to ruin them and weaken them, and to put Muslim men in jail. The law will be misused, you will see,"" Owaisi told reporters here.
The bill, known as Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill is a watered down version of the one which was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier and had got stalled in the Rajya Sabha.
The Lok Sabha passed the Triple Talaq bill which makes the practice a criminal offence with a provision of three-year jail term for the erring husband. It will now have to be passed by the Rajya Sabha to become a law.
The legislation, which replaces an Ordinance issued by the government in September, was passed by the Lower House of Parliament after the government asserted that it should not be seen from the prism of politics as 20 Islamic countries have already banned the practice and not secular India.
Among the various changes made in the initial bill, the new legislation has a provision for bail and mandates that an FIR should be filed only by the aggrieved woman or a blood relative.
The bill makes the offence of instant Triple Talaq compoundable, which means that the case can be withdrawn if the man and his estranged wife reach a compromise, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said while piloting the legislation.
The instant triple talaq was taken up in Parliament in August last year after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In the landmark 3-2 verdict, the apex court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that Triple Talaq was an integral part of religious practice. (ANI)"

Talaq or divorce can be obtained in either of two ways. Under 'talaq-ul-sunnat', there has to be a three-month period called 'iddat' between the pronouncement of talaq by a husband and a lawful separation. But 'talaq-e-bidat' authorises a man to do so in a single sitting.      The AIMPLB has issued appeals to all maulanas and imams of mosques to read out the code of conduct during Friday 'namaz' and emphasise on its implementation.      The board has made it clear that it will not tolerate any interference in the Shariat laws, and claimed that majority of the Muslims in the country do not want any change in their personal law.

They should not harm any community, but benefit the larger section of society. The Centre should rethink its decision,"" he said.Earlier on Sunday, the AIMPLB requested the Central Government to withdraw and withhold the triple talaq bill.While addressing a press briefing in Lucknow, AIMPLB's Sajjad Nomani accused the Centre of not following the laid procedure in drafting the bill.The body also claimed the bill was against women and children, and if implemented, would destroy many families.

The five judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), Jagdish Singh Khehar and four other judges Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Kurian Joseph, Uday Umesh Lalit and S. Abdul Nazeer, reserved the order after hearing in great detail from all the parties - from various petitioners and respondents and the Central government for six consecutive days during the summer vacation session.      The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) yesterday told the apex court that marriage in the Muslim community is a contract and in order to protect their interests, they can put special emphasis on certain clauses in 'nikahnama'.      The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce triple talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      The board's reply came after CJI J.S. Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it was possible to give bride the right to not accept instant triple talaq.      The board also showed the court a resolution passed on April 14, 2017 which stated triple talaq as a sin and that the community should boycott the person doing such an act.      The apex court also wanted to know from the AIMPLB if it was possible for the board whether their (SC) advisory will be followed by the Qazis at the ground level.      One of the board's lawyers Yousuf Hathim Muchala told the top court that the advisory of the AIMPLB was not mandatory for all Qazis to follow. Muchala, however, made it clear that the board accepted the suggestions in all humility and would look at it.      Sibal earlier on Monday's proceedings said the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all.      ""Yes, you should not hear,"" replied Sibal.      Earlier, Sibal asked the top court as to how a 1400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      The bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on the WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre, during the earlier hearing, assured the apex court that it would come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq is upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.      Rohatgi also conveyed to the apex court bench that triple talaq violates Muslim women's right to equality within the community, and also within the country      Earlier in the hearing, the apex court refused to hear all the three cases of Polygamy, Nikah and Halala at once, saying it would focus on one matter at a time.      The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides triple talaq.      However, the top court said that they have a limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the Supreme Court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether triple talaq is valid constitutionally. Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposed the triple talaq practice and wanted to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that Triple Talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court earlier observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.

""This Bill has exposed all those who consider themselves 'liberals'. A 'liberal' should ordinarily be hostile to the idea of discrimination and injustice perpetuated by an oral divorce. In this case, not one spoke in favour of the Bill which is ending the injustice. They raised weak arguments so that the fundamentalists amongst the Muslims are kept happy,"" Jaitley wrote in a blog titled, ""'Talaq' without a Social Security"".
""Let us assume the reverse of the present situation. What if such a provision existed in Hindu law? Liberals, leftists, women organisations and perhaps even the judiciary would have been shocked with such a provision and would have attempted either for a repeal of the law or it being declared unconstitutional. These people stand exposed because what they have attempted to raise farcical objections. They wanted to continue and defend an obsolete practice which promotes injustice,"" he added.
Jaitley went on to write that those with ""short-sighted"" vision have repeatedly argued that since the Supreme Court has declared the practice as unlawful, why punish a husband who is indulging in an unlawful act.
""The 'triple talaq' right used by him is unlawful and does not exist, then why send him to jail?""
""The Supreme Court, by striking down the practice of 'triple talaq', has merely made a declaration of the law. This declaration has to be followed by legislation which punishes the offending spouse for indulging in this cruel act despite it being declared unlawful. Many conservatives would still practice this irrespective of what the court has said. There is data available post the judgement which establishes that this is actually happening on the ground,"" Jaitley wrote.
""Besides being tried for the offence in a court, obviously the husband will have to pay maintenance to his wife. Both these will have a strong deterrent effect for those who want to use the weapon of 'triple talaq'. They will think hundred times before using it due to the onerous consequences of their illegality.""
Jaitley said he has no doubt that once an example is made out of some people, ""the fear of its consequences will lead to minimising this practice.""
""If this law was not enacted, the judgement of the Supreme Court will turn into a futile academic exercise where the practice is illegal, if you still indulge in it, no penal consequence visits you,"" he said.
Criticising the Congress party, he wrote, ""The Congress Party has ruled this country for a long time. During this period it has amended several personal laws to make them acceptable to the changing social mind-set. But when it comes to the Shariat, it is scared. It's stand in both the Shah Bano case and now in the legislation emanating from the Shayara Bano case, it has given a clear evidence of its intent.""
He added, ""It does not mind Muslim women being driven to destitution. After all, the fundamentalist vote bank is at a higher priority than justice being conferred to the female gender.""
Jaitley said that there is ""no social security for women in India"".
""Those who champion the case of liberalising the marriage and divorce laws must realise two basic facts. India is a developing society. Even though weaker sections are being provided certain facilities by the Government, the concept of social security does not exist in India. The second important fact is that in a divorce proceeding, no person can take advantage of his own wrong,"" he wrote.
He went on to explain, ""Christianity traditionally did not accept the idea of an easy divorce. The conservatives were opposed to the idea of divorce. However, with the economic evolution of developed countries along with the creation of a social security net, the laws in the developed world started liberalising.""
Jaitley said that in many societies, divorce is accompanied with the sharing of assets.
""We, in India, are still in a stage where sharing of assets is extremely rare, maintenance levels are extremely low and post a divorce, unless she is working or employed, the wife is driven to either dependency or destitution. On basic principles of humanity, justice and fairplay, would it be right, irrespective of religion, to give to the husband a unilateral right to end the marriage? The fear of the husband uttering three words will always keep the wife subjugated and bear the injustice,"" he wrote.
""The basic principle of matrimonial law is that no person can take advantage of his own wrong. The Shariat law was an exception. The husband may have wronged the wife and still despite his own matrimonial misconduct divorce her by uttering three words to dissolve the marriage. This is against all cannons of humanity, justice and fairplay. If this practice is adopted by others, many women would be driven to destitution,"" he added.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019 criminalises instant triple talaq among Muslims and attracts a jail term of three years for the husband.
The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring the Bill to the Select Committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against.

The board also said that divorce proceedings instead of triple talaq could damage a woman's chances of re-marriage if the husband indicts her of loose character in the court.

Launching an attack on the central government, he further asserted that 'the community is losing its patience now', ""All are our own people but when they behave like others, we feel astonished. They can bring an ordinance on Triple Talaq but what is being done for us.

He also criticised both the central government and the Supreme Court and called for a revolution.
""We all are very worried. We got majority votes for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and have one expectation that they will solve the issue. But nothing happened; I can see everything going opposite. Today my only submission is that all saints must get together to take a firm decision. We can tolerate no more insult. The court is doing what it is doing, but I want to ask why the case is constantly being deferred.

Soon after the Rajya Sabha passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019, Mufti tweeted, ""Fail to understand the need to pass the triple talaq bill especially since the Supreme Court had already declared it illegal. Undue interference seemingly to punish Muslims. Given the current state of the economy, should this really have been a priority?""
Mufti's post didn't go well with Abdullah, who tagged her post on the micro-blogging site and wrote, ""Mehbooba Mufti ji, you might want to check how your members voted on this bill before tweeting. I understand they abstained which helped the government with the numbers needed to pass the bill. You can't help the government and then 'fail to understand need to pass'!""
Replying to him, Mufti tweeted, ""Omar sahab, I suggest you get off your moral high horse since it was your own party that expelled Soz sahab for voting against the BJP in 1999. FYI in Parliament, abstention is essentially a no vote.""
Abdullah was quick to retort to Mufti's claims, and wrote, ""Madam, is recounting an incident from TWENTY years ago the best you can do to defend PDP duplicity? So you are accepting you instructed your MPs to abstain. And no an abstention is NOT a no vote, a no vote is a no vote. An abstention helped the BJP this time.""

The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring the Bill to the Select Committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against.
The BJP-led NDA government, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, still managed to have smooth sailing for the contentious bill because parties like AIADMK, which has 11 members and JDU, with six, walked out after recording their opposition to the Bill.

Outlining the Modi government's vision in its second term, President Ram Nath Kovind, in his customary address to joint sitting of Parliament, said the the building of a ""Strong, Safe, Prosperous and All-inclusive India"" is inspired by the basic spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas' (With all, development for all and with everyone's trust).""
In his nearly hour-long speech in the Central Hall of Parliament which, was repeatedly cheered by MPs of the ruling NDA combine with loud thumping of desks, the President spoke of the achievements during the first tenure of the Modi government and enumerated the steps to be taken to put the country on firm footing on basis of its political, social and economic agenda.
Referring to the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent aerial strikes in Balakot across the border, Kovind said that ""in future too all possible steps will be taken to ensure the country's security"".
 ""India has amply demonstrated both her intent and capabilities, first through surgical strikes and then through air strikes after the Pulwama attack at terrorist hideouts across the border. In future too, all possible steps will be taken to ensure our security,"" he said.
A day after Modi called a meeting of the Presidents of all parties represented in Parliament to discuss his pet idea of ""One Nation, One Election"", the President said it was the need of the hour and all MPs should ponder over it.
""Our vibrant democracy has also matured adequately.  During the last few decades, due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted.  
""Our countrymen have demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict both at State and National issues.  'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections' is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefitting our countrymen. 
""With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare. Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development oriented proposal of 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections'.""
Praising the voters of the country for giving a very clear mandate in the election, the President said after assessing the performance of the Government during the first tenure, the people have given even stronger support for the second term.
""By doing so, the people of the country have given a mandate for continuing uninterrupted and at an accelerated pace the journey of development which started in 2014,"" he said.
""Giving the highest regard to that mandate, my Government started to march forward without any discrimination with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas', to create a New India,"" he said
The President's address also focused on another issue - infiltration-- that was brought by the BJP during the recent elections.
""Illegal infiltrators pose a major threat to our internal security. This is leading to social imbalance in many parts of the country, as well as putting a huge pressure on limited livelihood opportunities.
""My Government has decided to implement the process of 'National Register of Citizens' on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration. Security along the border will be further strengthened to prevent infiltration,"" he said.
Kovind said while on the one hand, Government is working to identify the infiltrators, on the other, it is also fully committed to protecting the victims of persecution due to their faith.
""In this regard, efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting the linguistic, cultural and social identities,"" he said.
Asserting that New India will be sensitive and also economically prosperous, the President said but for this to happen nation's security is of utmost importance.
""My Government accords top most priority to national security. Therefore, effective steps are being taken to tackle Terrorism and Naxalism,"" he said.
""My Government is resolutely working to eradicate the menace of Naxalism from the country. Considerable success has been achieved in this direction during the last 5 years. The area affected by Naxalism is reducing continuously. In the coming years, development projects will be expedited in these areas, which will benefit our tribal brothers and sisters residing there,"" he said.
On Kashmir, Kovind said that my Government is making efforts with complete dedication to provide a safe and peaceful environment to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.
""The recently concluded peaceful elections to local bodies and to Lok Sabha have bolstered our efforts. My Government is committed to take all necessary steps for the development of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.
Touching on the topic of modernisation of the army and the armed forces, the President said India was going the receive the delivery of first 'Rafale' fighter aircraft and 'Apache' helicopters in the near future.
""Special emphasis is being accorded by the Government to manufacture of modern armaments under 'Make in India'. The policy of indigenously manufacturing weapons such as modern rifles and cannons, tanks and combat aircrafts is being carried forward successfully. 'Defence Corridors' coming up in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu will further strengthen this mission. While fulfilling our security requirements, export of defence equipment is also being encouraged,"" he said.
On economy, the President said India is now on the way to become the world's 5th largest economy in terms of GDP.
""To maintain the high growth rate, reform process will continue. It is our objective to make India a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2024,"" he said.
""Work is underway in full earnest to transform India into a Global Manufacturing Hub.  Keeping in view Industry 4.0, a New Industrial Policy will be announced shortly.  In 'Ease of Doing Business', India has leap-frogged 65 positions during the past 5 years, from a ranking of 142 in 2014 to 77.
""Now our goal is to be among the top 50 countries of the world.  In order to achieve this, process of simplification of rules will be further expedited in collaboration with the States. In this sequence, necessary amendments are also being brought in the Companies Law,"" Kovind said.
Touching on the unfinished task during the government's earlier tenure, the President said to secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' is imperative.
""I would urge all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of our sisters and daughters better and dignified,"" he said. (ANI)"

The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce Triple Talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      This came in response to when Chief Justice of India (CJI) Jagdish Singh Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it is possible to give bride the right to not accept instant Triple Talaq.      The board also showed the court a resolution passed on April 14 2017 which stated Triple Talaq as a sin and that the community should boycott the person doing such an act.      The apex court also wanted to know from the AIMPLB if it is possible for the board whether their (SC) advisory will be followed by the Qazis at the ground level.      One of the board's lawyers Yousuf Hathim Muchala told the top court that the advisory of AIMPLB is not mandatory for all Qazis to follow. Muchala, however, made it clear that the board accepts the suggestions in all humility and will look at it.      Sibal earlier on Monday's proceedings said the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all.      ""Yes, you should not hear,"" replied Sibal.      Earlier, Sibal asked the top court as to how a 1400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple Talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      The bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre, during the earlier hearing, assured the apex court that it would come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq is upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.      Rohatgi also conveyed to the apex court bench that Triple Talaq violates Muslim women's right to equality within the community, and also within the country      Earlier in the hearing, the apex court refused to hear all the three cases of Polygamy, Nikah and Halala at once, saying it will focus on one matter at a time.      The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides Triple Talaq.      However, the top court said that they have limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the Supreme Court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether Triple Talaq is valid constitutionally.      Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposes the Triple Talaq practice and wants to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that Triple Talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of Triple Talaq, the apex court observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.      A five-judge bench of the apex court further observed that it would not hear polygamy issue along with the Triple Talaq case. (ANI)"

The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could prove to be contentious.
The first two days of the session will be completely devoted to oath-taking by 542 members of the lower House of the Parliament.
One seat in the House is vacant as the election for Vellore constituency in Tamil Nadu was cancelled on charges of money use. Two more MPs will be nominated by the government from the Anglo Indian community, making the full house of 545.
The oath-taking by the new members will be overseen by the protem Speaker Virendra Kumar. President Ram Nath Kovind will administer him the oath of the office today morning at the Rashtrapati Bhavan before the Parliament Session begins. He will be assisted by a panel of senior members including Kodikunnil Suresh and Bhatruhari Mahtab in overseeing the proceedings when members take oath on Monday and Tuesday.
The election of Speaker of the Lok Sabha will be held on Wednesday followed by a joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament on Thursday when President Kovind will deliver his customary address.
Interest is now centred on who will be the new Speaker in the place of Sumitra Mahajan who did not contest the recent elections.
It remains to be seen whether the new Speaker will be a woman and if so whether it could be former minister Maneka Gandhi, also a senior MP. Before Mahajan, during the second term of the UPA, the post was held by Meira Kumar who became the first woman Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
The Union Budget will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, preceded by a pre-Budget Economic survey on July 4. It will be the full Budget of the year because the one presented before the elections was a vote on account.
Ahead of the session, the BJP parliamentary party was reconstituted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the leader of the House in the Lok Sabha and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh being his deputy. Justice Minister Thawarchand Gehlot has been named the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha with Railway Minister Piyush Goyal being his deputy.
Arun Jaitley, who was the Leader of the House, during the first Modi government, will be missed as he opted out of the government on health grounds.
Main opposition party Congress has yet to decide its leader of the party in both Houses of the Parliament. Sonia Gandhi, however, has been elected as leader of the Congress parliamentary party.
This session of the Parliament will have no former prime ministers as Manmohan Singh's Rajya Sabha term ended Friday while H D Deve Gowda could not make it to the Lok Sabha.
Some prominent faces will be missed in the session. Senior BJP leaders like L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharati, as they did not contest the elections. Similarly, Mallikarjun Kharge, who was the Leader of the Congress in the 16th Lok Sabha, and his deputy Jyotiraditya Scindia, will not be seen in the House as they failed to win the polls.
Some new faces including heavyweights Home Minister Amit Shah, Child and Women Welfare Minister Smriti Irani, Malegaon blast accused Pragya Singh Thakur, cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir (BJP), actors Ravi Kishan, Sunny Deol, singer Hans Raj Hans will appear on the treasury benches of the Lok Sabha. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a customary all-party meet where he said that the Parliament session should begin with ""fresh zeal and new thinking"".
Addressing the media after the all-party meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said that Modi has urged leaders of all parties to ""introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfil people's aspirations as their representatives and the manner in which last two years of the 16th Lok Sabha were wasted"".

A statement issued by Union Ministry of Law and Justice on Thursday said: “The President of India on February 21, 2019, has promulgated four Ordinances, namely, The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019 (Ord. 4 of 2019), The Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 (Ord. 5 of 2019), The Companies (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 (Ord. 6 of 2019), and The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019 (Ord. 7 of 2019).”
“The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019, has been promulgated to give continued effect to the provisions brought in by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019. This Ordinance, inter alia, declares the practice of triple talaq to be void and illegal and also to make it an offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years and fine,” says the statement.
The Ordinance will protect the rights of married Muslim women and deter the practice of divorce by triple talaq, that is, talaq –e –biddat. It also provides for payment of subsistence allowance and custody of minor children.
The Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 has been promulgated to give continued effect to the work already done by the Board of Governors (BOG) as per the provisions of earlier Ordinance.
“This Ordinance, inter alia, enables the Board of Governors appointed in supersession of the Medical Council of India (MCI) to continue to exercise the powers of MCI for a period of two years or till the Council is reconstituted, whichever is earlier so as to ensure transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country,” adds the statement.
In pursuance of the Central government’s objective of providing Ease of Doing Business to Law abiding corporate while simultaneously strengthening the corporate governance and compliance framework enshrined in the Companies Act, 2013, the Companies (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 has been promulgated with a view, to empower the Central government to allow certain companies to have a different financial year instead of as determined by the Tribunal.
This Ordinance, inter alia, addresses the need to impose civil liability for technical and procedural defaults of a minor nature and to plug the corporate governance and enforcement framework, through re-categorisation of 16 minor offences as civil defaults which will de-clog special courts, transfer of certain routine functions such as permitting conversion of a public company into a private company from NCLT to the Central government, making non-maintenance of registered office and non-reporting of commencement of business as grounds for striking of from register of companies; and breach of ceiling on Directorships being made a ground for disqualification, enhancing the pecuniary jurisdiction of Regional Director’s for compounding offences under the Companies Act with a view to unburdening the NCLT of routine functions etc.
The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019 has been promulgated to have central legislation to tackle the menace of illicit deposits taking activities in the country. Presently, non-banking entities are allowed to raise deposits from the public under the provisions of various statutes enacted by the Central government and State governments.
However, the regulatory framework for deposit-taking activity in the country is not seamless. Despite such diverse regulatory framework, schemes and arrangements leading to an unauthorised collection of money and deposits fraudulently by inducing the public to invest in uncertain schemes promising high returns or other benefits are still operating in the society.
“This Ordinance, therefore, ensures a comprehensive ban on unregulated deposit-taking activity and for its effective enforcement. It aims to prevent such unregulated deposit schemes or arrangements at their inception and at the same time makes soliciting, inviting or accepting deposits pursuant to an unregulated deposited scheme as a punishable offence,” says the statement.

The constitution allows Muslims, the biggest minority in the country, to regulate marriages, divorces, and inheritance through their own civil code.But in August, the Supreme Court had ruled that the practice is ""void"", ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"".As many as 22 Muslim countries have banned the triple talaq.

How is the Congress even talking about women empowerment?""
The Congress took strong exception to the triple talaq bill and the lesser strength of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Rajya Sabha prevented the bill's passage in the Upper House and hence, it could not be enacted.
""The Congress has never been serious about the safety of women. Here in Vijayapura, there was a case but what did the Congress government do? Northing,"" he added.
Prime Minister Modi slammed the Siddaramiah-led Karnataka government over the state of farmers, rural development, among other issues in the state, and stated that it was the Central Government which brought social security schemes for the poor as well as electricity to villages.
""The people of Karnataka have decided to punish the Congress party,"" Prime Minister Modi remarked, indicating imminent victory for BJP.
""Instead of going among the people, the Congress leaders are thinking about what excuses to make about a certain defeat. The reasons for their excuse will include faulty EVMs and other such reasons,"" the Prime Minister continued.
He further said that instead of taking the society together, the Congress is bothered about votes, ""I am here in a land closely associated with Bhagwan Basaveshwara.

The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring it to select committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against. 
The government, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, still managed to have a smooth sailing for the contentious bill because parties like AIADMK, which has 11 members and JDU, with six, walked out after recording their opposition to the bill. 
MPs belonging to parties like YSRCP and TRS reportedly abstained from voting while NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel and some Congress members were absent.      
The Bill has already been passed by the Lok Sabha.
The motion to refer the Bill to a select committee was negated with 84 members voting in its favour while 100 voted against it. The amendments moved by several opposition members were also defeated either by voting or by voice vote.

Soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu was to take up the Bill for its passage, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the entire opposition was for the empowerment of women but as far as the Bill was concerned, the opposition parties wanted some modification.
""This was the reason the opposition members moved some amendments. Our demand to refer the Bill to the select committee was rejected.

After his remarks, the voting took place and the Bill was declared passe by the Chairman.
Earlier, replying to the over four-hour-long debate, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted that the House did not need the mandate of the Supreme Court to pass a law.
He said that a woman had recently approached him because her husband had given her triple talaq over WhatsApp. ""Should I tell these women that you frame the Supreme Court judgment? If they go to the police, they'll be told that if there is no law then they can't file an FIR. I'm a minister in the Narendra Modi government and not the Rajiv Gandhi government. If there is a need for justice, we will bring a law on it,"" he said.
On Opposition parties questioning the jail term in the case of triple talaq, Prasad justified the move by citing the jail terms in anti-dowry law and for Hindu men marrying the second time.
""You spoke a lot today, Ghulam Nabi Azad. You (Congress) won 400 seats in 1986. There have been nine Lok Sabha elections after that, you did not get a majority in any of them. Think why did that happen? You were 44 in 2014, 52 today. In 1986 you rose to 400, Shah Bano's case happened in 1986 and you never received a majority after that. I am giving you food for thought,"" he said.
Participating in the debate, Opposition parties stressed that the Bill needs to be referred to a select committee for further scrutiny.
The Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the left parties opposed the Bill.

The court further observed that triple talaq sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional. It violates the rights of Muslim women,"" ruled the high court, adding that no personal law board was above the Constitution. (ANI)"

Prior to the adjournment, the House passed the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address, 2019-20 interim budget 2019-20 and appropriation bill without any debate.
Due to the adjournment of the Upper House, The Musilm Women (Protection of Rights on Marrrige) Bill and The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which have generated much heat, will lapse. The Bills were passed in Lok Sabha and were scheduled to be introduced in Rajya Sabha.
General elections are due in May.
According to the Rajya Sabha Legislative Procedure, a Bill pending in the Upper House which has not been passed by Lok Sabha does not lapse on the dissolution of the Lower House. But a Bill which is passed by Lok Sabha and is pending in Rajya Sabha stands lapsed on the dissolution of Lok Sabha.
Following disruption by Samajwadi Party members in Rajya Sabha and its subsequent adjournment on Tuesday, sources had said that the Centre was considering extending the current session of the Upper House of Parliament by a couple of days.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in Lok Sabha on January 8, seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who came to India before December 31, 2014. 
Attempts by the government to introduce the Bill in Rajya Sabha in the past six weeks were thwarted by the Opposition which sought it be referred to a Select Committee. 
The passage of the Bill in Lok Sabha has led to widespread protests in the North East. 
Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were imposed in East and West Imphal districts ahead of the proposed tabling of citizenship Bill in Rajya Sabha.
The triple talaq Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on December 27 last year with 245 votes in favour and 11 against it.
The Opposition parties want the Bill to be sent to a Select Committee of Parliament for further vetting, a demand rejected by the Centre. However, an ordinance was re-promulgated in January this year as the revised Bill could not be passed in Rajya Sabha where the government lacks majority.
The Bill criminalises the practice of instant triple talaq with a provision of three years imprisonment to the erring husband. (ANI)"

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will move the Bill which aims at making instant divorce illegal, a practice followed by a section of Muslims.
On Tuesday, the BJP issued a whip to its Lok Sabha members to be present in the House on December 27 when the Bill to ban instant triple talaq is taken up for discussion and is likely to be put to vote.
The three-line whip is a strict instruction to the Members of Parliament from their respective party which necessitates their presence in the House and participates in voting. Any breach of the whip has serious consequences including disciplinary action against the violators of the whip.
The Triple Talaq Bill intends to make the practice of instant triple talaq among Muslims an offence under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) with the provision of three-year jail for the husband. The Bill, earlier introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 17, will replace the ordinance issued by the central government in September this year, banning the instant triple talaq.
With the Lok Sabha failing to function properly due to disruptions ever since the Winter Session began on December 11, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on last Friday had chaired a meeting of the Rules Committee during which law to punish erring members with disciplinary action was favoured.
In the meeting, while referring to Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's comments that his party was ready to discuss the instant Triple Talaq Bill on December 27, the Speaker had said: ""I believe that on December 27 the House will function smoothly.""

The Bill, which proposes to criminalize the practice of Muslims men giving divorce to their wives by uttering the word ""Talaq"" thrice in quick succession, was passed by Lok Sabha three days back.
It needs to be passed by the Rajya Sabha to become a law.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2018 was slated to be taken up by the Rajya Sabha this afternoon for consideration and passing.
However, as soon as an effort was made to take this Bill up, an uproar erupted in the house.
TMC leader Derek O Brien said all opposition parties unanimously want the Bill to be sent to a select committee for proper scrutiny.
Echoing similar sentiments, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, said, ""This is such an important bill which can positively or negatively affect the lives of crores of people can't be passed just like this without going to a select committee.""
As the House was not in order, deputy chairman Harivansh adjourned the house for 15 minutes.
But when the House reconvened, uproar continued.
Congress leader Anand Sharma said that a legislative scrutiny was critical of the Bill before it could be taken up by the house.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affair Vijay Goel attacked the opposition for stalling the Bill, saying they had no sympathy for the Muslim women.
Amid the uproar Harivansh adjourned the house for the day. (ANI)"

""An unnerved BJP finding itself cornered on the issue of repeated and gruesome rape incidents, as also issues of women security seeking to divert and reset the political agenda by hurriedly bringing an ordinance on Instant Triple Talaq. Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have become habitual offenders of using the issue of Instant Triple Talaq as a political football for vote garnering rather than ensuring the welfare and subsistence of Muslim women,"" he added.
He claimed that the central government is indulging in ""mere vilification and blame game"" without releasing the proposed ordinance or listing out the solutions or concerns raised by Muslim women.
Earlier in the day, the Centre approved an ordinance after the Triple Talaq Bill could not be tabled in the Rajya Sabha due to lack of consensus last month during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament, even as the Union Cabinet had approved an amendment to the Bill.
Triple Talaq, or verbal divorce, is often practised by a section in the Muslim community in India to instantly divorce their wives by uttering the word 'Talaq' three times.

""The BJP's doors are always open for the good people. It is up to HS Phoolka to decide whether he wants to join the BJP or not,"" Goel said in response to a question from ANI.

Following his resignation from the AAP, speculations were rife that Phoolka was joining the BJP. Speculations got credence when the BJP decided to felicitate him for fighting the legal battle of families of 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims.

The fresh bill, which prohibits divorce of Muslim couples by pronouncing 'talaq' (divorce) three times by their husbands, was first introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday to replace an ordinance issued in September. Under this proposed law, Muslim men giving instant triple talaq will attract imprisonment of three years.
According to the Lok Sabha's revised business list, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will introduce the bill in the lower house today. ""Ravi Shankar Prasad to move that the Bill to protect the rights of married Muslim women and to prohibit divorce by pronouncing talaq by their husbands and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, be taken into consideration,"" the document read.
The ordinance was passed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet as this bill could not be tabled on the last day of the Monsoon session held in September, owing to a lack of consensus among political quarters.
The central government gave nod to a number of crucial amendments to the Ordinance, including a provision for bail to an accused before the commencement of trial. The other amendment cleared by the Centre includes allowing only a woman or her close kin to file a police case against her spouse for instant triple talaq.
As per the Ordinance, the victim is also allowed to drop the case if her spouse comes around later and they arrive at a compromise. It also mandates that the magistrate can decide on releasing the husband on bail only after hearing the wife's stance.
In accordance with the Ordinance, a Muslim woman against whom talaq has been declared is entitled to get subsistence allowance from her spouse for herself and for her dependent children. The amount of the allowance will be determined by the Magistrate hearing the case.
The current Ordinance also allows victims to seek custody of her minor children; however, the manner of custody will be determined by the Magistrate. It also makes all declaration of talaq, including in written or electronic form, to be void (i.e. not enforceable in law) and illegal.
The issue of triple talaq was taken up in the Parliament after in August last year, a five-judge bench of the apex court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the Supreme Court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that triple talaq was an integral part of religious practice.(ANI)"

Earlier in the day, the apex court observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.

The apex court is hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women rejecting the practice of triple talaq.      Relentless debates on the validity and plausibility of this practice were instigated soon after one petitioner, Shayara Banu, challenged the Muslim personal law over instantaneous application of triple talaq (talaq-e-bidat), polygamy and nikah-halala.      Supporting the stance of ending the practice of triple talaq, the Allahabad High Court had earlier asserted that the rights of any person, including Muslim women, cannot be violated in the name of 'personal law'.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice ""unconstitutional"".      The court further observed that triple talaq sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.

If they read, they'll themselves discover that these things don't exist,"" Shaukat Ali told ANI.      The Islamic scholar further said that the Allah considers both the sexes equal, adding that there is no gender discrimination in Islam.      ""Muslim women read the Quran in a language which they don't understand. They should read it in translated language and from beginning to end in order to discover that such a thing does not exist. God is just towards both the sexes because there's no discrimination in Islam,"" she said.      Joining the chorus of voices against Triple Talaq, Salma Ansari yesterday noted that saying talaq thrice does not amount to anything, and further called on Muslim women to read the Quran thoroughly instead of relying on clerics for their views on Islam.      ""There can be no 'talaq' just because someone says 'talaq, talaq, talaq' three times,"" Ansari told reporters.      ""Whatever the maulana said you think it's true. You read the Quran in Arabic but never read its translations. Women should read the Quran, ponder on it, gain knowledge what the Shariat says and not just follow anyone blindly,"" she added.      Ansari was participating in a program at Chacha Nehru Madarsa run by Aligarh's Al Noor charitable society.      The Allahabad High Court had in December 2016 held that the practice of triple talaq is 'cruel' and raised an issue that whether the Muslim Personal Law could be amended to provide relief to the Muslim women.      The High Court also stated that the form of 'instant divorce' is 'most demeaning'.      The Supreme Court is to hear multiple pleas challenging the validity of triple talaq, 'nikah halala' and polygamy practices among Muslims community on May 11 by a Constitution bench during the summer vacation.      Earlier, on March 27, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the apex court that the pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.

Briefing media after the cabinet meeting, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, ""A lot of decisions were taken by Cabinet today. A bill to abolish Triple Talaq will be brought during the upcoming session of parliament. Cognisance will be taken of the objections raised by Opposition on it.""
The minister termed it as a testimony of - Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas.
""It is the debt of humanity. It is about gender equality and gender justice. Earlier also, we tried two-three times but it did not get through in Rajya Sabha,"" he said.
Javadekar also claimed that a lot of people supported the bill during the recently held General Elections.
""As you know that Talaq-E-Bidat is illegal in several Muslim nations, so, this decision will impart justice to Muslim women,"" the Minister said while expressing hope that this time Rajya Sabha will approve the bill.
""The Bill would ensure gender equality and gender justice to Muslim women. The Bill would also help in protecting the rights of married Muslim women and prevent divorce by the practice of 'talaq-e-biddat' by their husbands. The Bill will be introduced in the forthcoming session of the Parliament,"" he said.
The Bill proposes to declare the practice of triple talaq as void and illegal. It makes the offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years and fine. It also provides for payment of subsistence allowance to married Muslim women and dependent children.
The Bill also proposes to make the offence cognizable, if information relating to the commission of an offence is given to an officer in charge of a police station by the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced or by any person related to her by blood or marriage.
The offence is made compoundable with the permission of the Magistrate at the instance of the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced.
The Bill further provides for hearing the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced before the accused is released on bail by the Magistrate.
According to an official statement, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 is on similar lines of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019, an official statement said.
The triple talaq Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on December 27 last year with 245 votes in favour and 11 against it.
However, the bill lapsed after it could not get through Rajya Sabha and subsequent dissolution of Lok Sabha.
On an earlier occasion too, the bill could not be passed from Rajya Sabha even after it was approved by the Lok Sabha. (ANI)"

Speaking to ANI, Sethi said there was nothing wrong in what he said.

""BJP is known everywhere as a communal party, even though they deny it their actions prove otherwise. They use such nasty topics against a community which may increase communal tension and set fire in the state,"" Mishra said. 
""There are many things which are mentioned in books, they are presented in a different context in the books. But it is not necessary to say them in the Assembly,"" he added.
Earlier today, President Ram Nath gave his nod to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019, which criminalises instant 'triple talaq' among Muslims and attracts a jail term of three years for the husband.
The President's approval came two days after the Rajya Sabha passed the triple talaq bill after rejecting the Opposition's demand to refer the Bill to the Select Committee and to remove the criminality clause which provides for jailing the husband for three years for pronouncing 'triple talaq' to his wife.
The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring the Bill to the Select Committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against it.
With the President's approval, the Bill has become an Act.

In his address to the nation on the eve of 73rd Independence Day, the President said the illustrious generation that led to the country to freedom did not perceive independence only in terms of transfer of political power but ""as a stepping stone in a longer and larger process of nation-building and national welding"".
Their objective, he said, was to improve the life of each individual, each family and of society as a whole. 
""In this backdrop, I am confident that the recent changes made in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh would be of immense benefit to those regions. They will enable the people to access and enjoy the same rights, same privileges, and the same facilities as their fellow citizens in the rest of the country.

The Parliament earlier this month adopted a resolution to repeal Article 370, which provided special powers to Jammu and Kashmir. 
It also passed a bill to reorganize Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir (with legislature) and Ladakh without it.
The reorganization bill was signed by the President after it was passed by the two houses of parliament and it was notified by the government on August 9.
Another bill passed by parliament to extend 10 per cent reservation to economically backward sections will also apply to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

The top court had also made it clear that it wants to adjudicate on the triple talaq issue as it is a matter involving a person's human rights.

She also wants to outlaw polygamy within a Muslim marriage.      In December last year, the Allahabad High Court termed the Islamic practice of divorcing a woman by uttering the word ""talaq"" thrice as unconstitutional.      The court further observed that the triple talaq practice sanctioned under Muslim Personal Law that governs marriage, property and divorce violates the rights of Muslim women.      ""Triple talaq is unconstitutional, it violates the rights of Muslim women,"" ruled the High Court, adding that no personal law board is above the Constitution.

Meanwhile, commenting on the recent talaq cases in Hyderabad and Uttar Pradesh, the chairman of Minorities Commission serving Telangana and Andhra Pradesh said such incidents are extremely unfortunate.      ""First of all I condemn these types of acts and I strongly ask my community to stand up against these type of things and condemn it and protect the women from such whimsical ways of doing talaq which is illegal arbitrary and not as per Islamic laws,"" he told ANI.      A 38-year-old man, identified as Mohammed Haneef, was arrested in Hyderabad earlier on Friday after he sent a postcard with 'triple talaq' to divorce his wife. The arrest took place a day after his wife lodged a complaint against him.      In a similar incident in Uttar Pradesh, a woman was given triple talaq over phone on March 23.      The Allahabad High Court had in December 2016 held that the practice of triple talaq is 'cruel' and raised an issue whether the Muslim Personal Law could be amended to provide relief to the Muslim women.      The High Court also stated that the form of 'instant divorce' is 'most demeaning'.      The Supreme Court is to hear multiple pleas challenging the validity of triple talaq, 'nikah halala' and polygamy practices among the Muslims community on May 11.      Earlier on March 27, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the apex court that the pleas challenging such practices among the Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed three rallies; United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Chairperson Sonia Gandhi made her first public appearance after two years in Bijapur district.
Since the Prime Minister has started campaigning in Karnataka, he has been censuring the Congress over several issues. He continued his tirade against the Congress in Vijayapura, Koppal, and Bengaluru rallies.
In Vijayapura, Prime Minister Modi launched fresh salvo against the Congress and raised questions on the grand old party's stand on women empowerment over Triple Talaq Bill.
""It is the Congress party that did not allow the law on Triple Talaq to be passed. How is the Congress even talking about women empowerment?"" Prime Minister Modi said.
The Congress took strong exception to the triple talaq bill and the lesser strength of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Rajya Sabha prevented the bill's passage in the Upper House and hence, it could not be enacted.
In Koppal, the Prime Minister accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of being insensitive towards the farmers.
""Why is it that farmers of Karnataka face shortage of water? Congress government, being in 'sleep mode', is doing nothing to address their problems. In five years, they ruined the farmers of Karnataka,"" said Prime Minister Modi.
In Bengaluru, Prime Minister Modi said that Karnataka needs 'sensitive' and 'receptive' Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government unlike Congress which has no vision for the state.
""Congress lacks a forward looking vision for the development of Karnataka, which needs a BJP Government which is sensitive and receptive in nature,"" Prime Minister Modi said.
He also alleged that Bengaluru's crumbling infrastructure and women's safety are not a priority for the state Siddaramaiah-led government.
On the other hand, Sonia Gandhi's speech was focused on the Prime Minister. She said Prime Minister Modi is a good orator but speeches cannot fill empty stomachs.
She also accused the Prime Minister of spreading lies and distorting historical facts for his political motives.
The UPA Chairperson alleged that Prime Minister Modi did not meet Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who wanted an appointment to discuss the issue of draught-hit farmers.
The UPA Chairperson alleged that Modi government even provided least drought compensation to Congress-led Karnataka.
She said that the Congress has worked for Karnataka's development and has made it Number one state in the country despite Centre's bias towards the state.
Sonia Gandhi's public appearance came after Prime Minister Modi on Sunday said that Sonia Gandhi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi are out on bail in connection with Rs. 5000 crore.
The political battle for Karnataka has reached its acme where ruling Congress, BJP, and Janata Dal (Secular) are leaving no stone unturned to win trust of voters who will cast their votes on May 12. The counting of votes and announcement of result will take place on May 15, 2018. (ANI)"

The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce Triple Talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      The board's reply came after Chief Justice of India (CJI) Jagdish Singh Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it is possible to give bride the right to not accept instant Triple Talaq.      The board also showed the court a resolution passed on April 14 2017 which stated Triple Talaq as a sin and that the community should boycott the person doing such an act.      The apex court also wanted to know from the AIMPLB if it is possible for the board whether their (SC) advisory will be followed by the Qazis at the ground level.      One of the board's lawyers Yousuf Hathim Muchala told the top court that the advisory of AIMPLB is not mandatory for all Qazis to follow. Muchala, however, made it clear that the board accepts the suggestions in all humility and will look at it.

Earlier this week, over a million Muslims from across India had signed a petition to end the controversial divorce practice of triple talaq.      The petition was started by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an Islamic organisation affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), adding that the positive response to the petition has been linked with the Bharatiya Janata Patry's recent success in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.      Several women have filed a petition before the apex court seeking the quashing of the triple talaq practice.      The Central Government has also told the top court that it is against gender injustice and for equality between men and women under the Constitution.      However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) defended the practice, saying it is better to divorce a woman than kill her.      Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that he favoured the discontinuation of 'triple talaq', stating that ""lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be destroyed by triple talaq.""      He also targeted the opposition for 'politicising' the issue and supporting a gender discriminatory practice to appease their vote banks. (ANI)"

""Gender equality and dignity of women are non-negotiable, overarching constitutional values and can brook no compromise,"" the government said in an affidavit filed in the top court.

The government, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, still managed to have a smooth sailing for the contentious bill because parties like AIADMK, which has 11 members and JDU, with six, walked out after recording their opposition to the bill.
MPs belonging to parties like YSRCP and TRS reportedly abstained from voting while NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel and some Congress members were absent.
The Bill has already been passed by the Lok Sabha.
The motion to refer the Bill to a select committee was negated with 84 members voting in its favour while 100 voted against it. The amendments moved by several opposition members were also defeated either by voting or by voice vote.

I congratulate PM Narendra Modi ji for fulfilling his commitment and ensuring a law to ban Triple Talaq, which will free Muslim women from the curse of this regressive practice. I thank all parties who supported this historic bill,"" the Home Minister tweeted.
Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government has fulfilled its commitment by giving justice to Muslim women.
""Today is a historic day. Both the Houses have given justice to Muslim women. This is the beginning of a transforming India,"" he told reporters outside Parliament.
Prasad tweeted: ""A historic day when the Rajya Sabha passed the #TripleTalaq Bill, earlier passed by Lok Sabha. Govt of PM @narendramodi has fulfilled its commitment by giving justice to Muslim women. No more Talaq-Talaq-Talaq!""
Former finance minister Arun Jaitley also lauded the development and tweeted, ""The passage of the bill criminalising Triple Talaq in Muslim Personal Law is monumental change in Personal Law. Disheartened that the 'So Called Liberals' have opposed a progressive law. Congratulations to all, particularly Muslim women.""
However, on the contrary, Congress leader Raj Babbar termed the bill as a ""historical mistake"".
""I think this is a big blow for family law in the country. A civil law has been made a criminal law. It's a historic mistake,"" he said.
The government scored a major victory in the Rajya Sabha on the back of cracks in the opposition when the House passed the triple talaq bill after rejecting the Opposition's demand to refer it to the select committee and to remove the criminality clause which provides for jailing the husband for three years for pronouncing triple talaq to his wife.
The Bill was passed with 99 members in its favour while 84 members voted against it in the final division. In the division on referring it to select committee, the government got 100 votes while 84 voted against.
The government, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, still managed to have a smooth sailing for the contentious bill because parties like AIADMK, which has 11 members and JDU, with six, walked out after recording their opposition to the bill.
MPs belonging to parties like YSRCP and TRS reportedly abstained from voting while NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel and some Congress members were absent.
The Bill has already been passed by the Lok Sabha.
The motion to refer the Bill to a select committee was negated with 84 members voting in its favour while 100 voted against it. The amendments moved by several opposition members were also defeated either by voting or by voice vote.

""We appreciate the stand the Centre has taken, we have always been demanding that the Muslim family law need to be codified so that the value of the Quran and the Constitutional Right of Equality and Justice are able to become part of the Muslim family law,"" Jahan told ANI.      She said that there is a need to codified Muslim family law like it has been codified in different religions, so that practices like triple talaq, halala, polygamy could be abolished and women would be given justice.      Meanwhile, Muslim Cleric, Hina Zaheer condemned Congress leader Manish Tewari statement on triple talaq and said that what is the need of law if one has to bring reforms from within.      ""If the reformation has to be done from inside that what is the need of constitution, law or court of conduct.   To bring these changes some forces are needed, people can't change themselves. If he can bring changes in himself than why would he make a mistake at the first place,"" she said.

""Validity of Triple Talaq and polygamy have to be seen in light of gender justice, equality and dignity of women,"" stated the Centre in its affidavit.      The Government also said that polygamy and triple talaq do not adhere to constitutional values and, therefore, cannot be accepted.      The Muslim law board had earlier claimed that triple talaq is a 'personal law' and, hence, cannot be modified by the Centre. (ANI)"

Speaking on ""Abolition of Triple Talaq - Correction of a historic wrong"" at the Constitution Club of India here, Shah traced the journey of the Act, saying that he had spoken on the issue of Triple Talaq when it was in the ordinance format and when it was a bill.
He said that it was a proud moment for him to speak of the issue of Triple Talaq when it had finally been enacted by the Parliament.
Blaming the policy of appeasement for the opposition to the removal of Triple Talaq, he said that while removal of social evils is generally welcomed by society, it was appeasement that led to some opposition to the move.
Shah said that social unity and holistic development are hampered because of appeasement. He said that the development of an entire society takes hard work and rigorous planning, and requires dedication, commitment, and empathy.
Calling appeasement a ""shortcut"", he said that appeasement never leads to development.
Shah said that those who are left behind in the journey of development must be empowered, and that holistic, all-encompassing, last-mile development is the philosophy of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Giving the examples of nations that had abolished Triple Talaq, Shah said that several Islamic nations had already taken the step decades ago, and this proves that such a barbaric practice is not part of Islamic culture.
Praising the tenacity and decisiveness of the government, Shah said that the road to ending Triple Talaq was not easy, as the Bill was not able to pass through the Rajya Sabha multiple times.
However, the government persisted with the passage of the Bill and was ultimately successful.
Commenting on the Constitutional Status of the issue, Shah said that a five-judge Constitution Bench had pronounced with a majority of 3-2 that the practice of Triple Talaq violates Article 14 of the Constitution -- equality before the law and equal protection of the law. Thus, the Supreme Court itself has declared the practice of Triple Talaq to be illegal, unconstitutional, arbitrary and void.
Shah said that the society must progress with time, otherwise, it becomes stale. He also said that the abolition of Triple Talaq would ensure dignity and equality for crores of Muslim women.
Commenting on the aspect of imprisonment for the violation of the Act, Shri Shah remarked that the correction of many social evils required the application of criminal laws - from Sati Pratha and child marriages to polygamy and dowry.
Regarding the maintenance of the aggrieved wife and children, Shah said that the husband will be required to provide for the wife he divorces through Triple Talaq, as well as their children.
Shah said that the law stipulates three years of imprisonment for violators, and bail is possible only after the aggrieved woman has had a chance to present her side to the court. Thus, this law empowers Muslim women in the truest sense of the word.
Commenting on the results of a survey, Shah said that 92.1 per cent Muslim women wanted Triple Talaq gone. He said that he was proud of having voted against ending the social evil of Triple Talaq.
Shah observed that nepotism, casteism, and appeasement have collectively damaged the nation's polity, and emphasised that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government had taken steps to remove all three from India's polity.
Shah stated that with the passage of the Act, the Prime Minister's promise to the nation stands fulfilled. He also said that the world looks up to India with respect because of this move.
He remarked that great social reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy, Jyotiba Phule, Kavi Narmad Mahatma Gandhi, Veer Savarkar, and Dr Ambedkar have all contributed to uplifting our society and removing social evils.
He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name would find a place in the list of great social reformers because of his leadership in the quest for abolishing the practice of Triple Talaq.
Hailing the Prime Minister for the decision, Shah said that the journey of the nation towards development must not stop here. He emphasised that the nation must function not on nepotism, casteism or appeasement, but on merit. (ANI)"

The apex court has tagged this plea with pending matter in court.      The petitioner Ishrat Jahan has sought a declaration from the apex court, saying that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was unconstitutional, as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 21 (life) and 25 (religion) of the Constitution.      In her petition, Jahan has asked whether an arbitrary and unilateral divorce through triple talaq can deprive the wife of her rights in her matrimonial home as also her right to have custody of her children.      A batch of petitions is being heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and notices have already been issued to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and others.      However, this is not first such type of petition that has been presented before the Supreme Court.      Uttarakhand based Shayara Banu, another Muslim woman and the Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh through its president Farah Faiz, have raised similar queries.      On July 29, the apex court had favoured a wider debate on the petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq.      All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) president Shaista Ambar has demanded abolishing of the triple talaq system.      Talaq-e-bidat is a Muslim man divorcing his wife by pronouncing the word ""talaq"" more than once in a single tuhr (the period between two menstruations), or in a tuhr after coitus or pronouncing an irrevocable instantaneous divorce at one go (unilateral triple-talaq).      The Centre has set up a high-level committee to review the status of women in India, and according to reports, has recommended a ban on the practice of oral, unilateral and triple talaq (divorce) and polygamy.

""I have suggested that this harmonising effort has to be undertaken. The personal law board has said that the harmonising effect cannot be done by court and should not be done by court.

Deviating from the Muslim Personal Law Board's opinion, Khurshid said one cannot contract out of faith, just like one cannot legislate out of faith.      The apex court reserved its order in the case, on Thursday pertaining with validity of the Islamic divorce practice - triple talaq.      The five judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), Jagdish Singh Khehar and four other judges Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Kurian Joseph, Uday Umesh Lalit and S. Abdul Nazeer, reserved the order after hearing in great detail from all the parties - from various petitioners and respondents and the Central government for six consecutive days during the summer vacation session.      The AIMPLB on Wednesday told the apex court that marriage in the Muslim community is a contract and in order to protect their interests, they can put special emphasis on certain clauses in 'nikahnama'.      The board further said that a Muslim woman had every right to pronounce triple talaq in all forms, and also ask for very high 'mehr' amount in case of talaq.      The board's reply came after CJI J.S. Khehar asked AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal if it was possible to give bride the right to not accept instant triple talaq.      The board also showed the court a resolution passed on April 14, 2017 which stated triple talaq as a sin and that the community should boycott the person doing such an act.      Sibal earlier on Monday's proceedings said the apex court should not decide or interfere in one's faith and belief.      To this, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the five judges constituting the bench asked, if they should not hear the matter at all.      ""Yes, you should not hear,"" replied Sibal.      Earlier, Sibal asked the top court as to how a 1400-year-old practice be branded 'unconstitutional'.      ""Triple talaq is going on since 1400 years, how can you say it is unconstitutional?"" Sibal asked the apex court.      Sibal further argued that just like the Hindus' faith about Rama's birth at Ayodhya cannot be questioned, similarly Triple Talaq which is also a matter of faith for Muslims should not be questioned.      The bench also questioned the AIMPLB on the position of e-divorce given on the WhatsApp in Islam.      The Centre, during the earlier hearing, assured the apex court that it would come out with a law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if Triple Talaq is upheld as invalid.      ""The government will come out with law to regulate marriage and divorce among Muslims if court holds Triple Talaq as invalid,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench.      Rohatgi also conveyed to the apex court bench that triple talaq violates Muslim women's right to equality within the community, and also within the country.      Earlier in the hearing, the apex court refused to hear all the three cases of Polygamy, Nikah and Halala at once, saying it would focus on one matter at a time.      The Attorney General and top law officers representing the Central government arguing in front of the five judge Constitution bench said the apex court should hear other cases also, besides triple talaq.      However, the top court said that they have a limited time, so all the matters could not be covered at present.      On the second day of the hearing, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is the amicus curiae in the matter, said before the Supreme Court that the controversial Islamic divorce system cannot be justified whatsoever.      Citing examples, Khurshid told the court that the Triple Talaq practice cannot be validated constitutionally.      ""There was a discussion that whether triple talaq is valid constitutionally. Substantiating my view with reasons and examples, I asserted that it cannot be justified and cannot be given law's validation,"" Khurshid said during the hearing.      The Centre, earlier on May 11, told the apex court that it opposed the triple talaq practice and wanted to fight for women equality and gender justice.      However, AIMPLB counsel Kapil Sibal told the apex court that Triple Talaq is a matter that comes under the Muslim board and therefore, in his opinion, the top court should not interfere in it.      ""The Central Government makes rules but in my opinion the apex court should not interfere into it,"" Sibal said.      While hearing several pleas filed by Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq, the apex court earlier observed that it would examine whether the issue is fundamental to religion or not.

The legislation, which replaces an Ordinance issued by the government in September, was passed by the Lower House of Parliament after the government asserted that it should not be seen from the prism of politics as 20 Islamic countries have already banned the practice and not the secular India.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill is a watered down version of the one which was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier and had got stalled in the Rajya Sabha.
It will now have to be passed by the Rajya Sabha to become a law and replace an Ordinance issued by the government in September this year.
Among the various changes made in the initial bill, the new legislation has a provision for bail and mandates that an FIR should be filed only by the aggrieved woman or a blood relative.
The bill makes the offence of instant Triple Talaq compoundable, which means that the case can be withdrawn if the man and his estranged wife reach a compromise, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said while piloting the legislation.
He emphasised that the bill was ""not against any community, religion or belief.""
The government brought the measure after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court termed as unconstitutional the practice that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives by simply uttering the word 'talaq' three times in quick succession.
There have been hundreds of complaints by the affected women against the practice.
Some Opposition parties, including the Congress, AIADMK and TMC, staged a walk out of the House just before the bill was put to vote as their demand for sending it to a Joint Select Committee was not accepted.
However, other Opposition parties like RSP, AIMIM and BJD did not walk out of the House but moved some amendments which were negated.
BJD leader B Mahtab appreciated the government for toning down the provisions in the initial legislation.
Law Minister Ravi Shanker Prasad, while strongly justifying the legislation, questioned why such a measure could be made into a law when the country can have a law against dowry.
The minister defended the non-bailable clause in the bill, saying offences such as domestic violence and dowry are also non-bailable offences.
He said the proposed law should not be seen through the prism of politics.
Asserting that the measure was aimed at ensuring rights and justice to the women, Prasad said, ""Twenty Islamic nations have banned Triple Talaq, then why can't a secular nation like India?""
""The Opposition's demand for a joint select committee has possibly only one reason -- Why it is criminalized? When Parliament has passed bills calling for harsh punishment for other crimes then why no one said what will happen to families of culprits,"" Prasad said.
Leader of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge said the bill should be sent to a Joint Select Committee of Parliament for a detailed assessment. He suggested that such a committee could be asked to submit its report within 15 days.
""This is a very important bill which needs detailed study. It is also a constitutional matter. I request the bill be sent to joint select committee"" he said.
Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay also pressed for sending the bill to a Select Committee, as did AIADMK's P Venugopal.
Samajwadi Party's Dharmendra Yadav said Triple Talaq was a social issue and the BJP was trying to politicise the matter.
NCP's Supriya Sule also said that the issue was social and should not be converted into a political issue.
BJP ally Shiv Sena's Arvind Sawant used the occasion to rake up Ram Temple issue, asking the government to live up to its promise on it and bring an Ordinance.
CPIM leader Mohd Saleem said the bill was unnecessary. (ANI)"

The party which claims to be the champion of Muslim causes staged a vanishing act yesterday in the Lower House during the voting on the Triple Talaq Bill which prohibits divorce of Muslims couples by pronouncing talaq three times by their husbands. Interestingly, their alliance partner in Telangana, AIMIM has been vehemently opposing the Bill in Lok Sabha and its only member Asaduddin Owaisi voted against the Bill.
During the debate in the Lok Sabha yesterday, TRS Parliamentary Party leader A P Jithender Reddy had stated that the Centre under the pretext of protecting women's rights is aiming to mess with the integrity of the country.
""Modifying religious practices is not the purpose of this House. This Bill is entirely arbitrary. We should ensure the integration of minority community into the majority, not alienate them. This Bill is misconceived,"" he added.
The statement from Reddy came just days after its party chief Rao had stated that he is jointly working with All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party president Asaduddin Owaisi on a national level in order to unify the Muslim community in India, in accordance with plans chalked out for a Federal Front.
However, when it came to taking a stand on the Bill, TRS, which is perceived to be cosying up with the BJP as well, decided to abstain.
A TRS Parliamentarian said on Friday that the party had decided only to participate in the discussion on Triple Talaq but not in voting.
Before the commencement of the Assembly elections, Chief Minister KCR had launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not increasing Muslim reservations to 12 per cent during various public meetings and assured that he will continue to fight for Muslims in getting reservation.
On a closer look, the political outfit while distributing the tickets for the Assembly elections this time selected only two Muslim candidates out of a total of 105. Moreover, in 2014, there were as less as eight Muslims in the Telangana Assembly. Out of eight, seven were from AIMIM in Hyderabad region and one was from TRS from Nizamabad.
After four hours of debate, the Bill was passed in the lower house of the Parliament amid din on the floor of the House with 11 noes and 245 ayes.
The issue of Triple Talaq was taken up in the Parliament after in August last year, a five-judge bench of the Apex Court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the Apex Court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that Triple Talaq was an integral part of religious practice.(ANI)"

Khan made the statement after, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi earlier today said, he hopes that AIMPLB challenges the Triple Talaq Bill in the Supreme Court.
The former Union Minister told ANI, AIMPLB first dubbed practice of triple talaq as ""sinful, oppressive and unjust"", however, they later in a press conference in Bhopal changed their stance.
""We are a democracy. Everybody is entitled to have an opinion. You have every right to challenge the constitutional validity of an enactment passed by Parliament. I can't question what he is saying. But I find it very difficult to understand that Muslim Personal Law board which through an additional affidavit promised to the Supreme Court that they will start a campaign against triple talaq which they said is prohibited, sinful, oppressive and unjust. They admitted everything,"" Khan told ANI a day after the Rajya Sabha passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019.
""They said that we will call for social boycott if someone resorts to it. But 10 days later, they changed their stance at a conference in Bhopal and said this practice will continue notwithstanding with the judgment which are being given by the courts. How do they go now to the Supreme Court, how will they reconcile what they had said in affidavit and now when they are coming again and challenging the constitutional validity. I would like to watch what they say there. I welcome this. They should go to the court,"" he added.
Khan, who was a minster in the Rajiv Gandhi government but left the Congress in 1986 over Muslim Personal Law Bill and triple talaq legislation, said if Owaisi wants equality then he should ask the government to implement common civil code.
""Owaisi said Hindu men will be jailed for one year and Muslim men will be jailed for three year. If he is so keen on equality, why does he not ask the government to apply the family laws equally to every citizen of India and let us have a common civil code,"" he said.
Khan said that divorce is a civil matter and triple divorce is a ""criminal act"".
""Nobody can stop anyone from seeking a divorce. But the Supreme Court said that the triple talaq is arbitrary where you make three pronouncements and the woman is thrown of her marital home. This is not a civil act. Divorce is a civil matter and a triple divorce is a criminal act,"" he said.  
""For criminal act, you will not find any single instance in the Muslim jurisprudence where an action which is held to be 'haram' is not punishable. Even Personal Law Board says it is haram. Even if you go by their viewpoint if it is 'haram' then it has to be punishable,"" Khan said.   (ANI)"

He further elaborated that on August 1, the President gave the approval to make triple talaq criminal.
""In 1985 Congress made a terrible mistake which made Muslim women pay heavily. Communists who speak about women's empowerment were against its abolition,"" said the Minister. He pointed out that women posted videos with hashtag #ShukriyaModiBhaiJaan.   
As around 15 Muslim women entered the room where Union Ministers Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Smriti Irani and Ravi Shankar Prasad were to address them, and others virtually connecting across the states, they were greeted by PM Modi's speech in Parliament when the law against triple talaq was passed, a year ago.

As per the latest dossier issued by Rajya Sabha secretary-general Desh Deepak Verma on Monday all India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Aam Aadmi Party, Nationalist Congress Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist) have withdrawn their support in turning the Bill into the law.
On December 27, the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha amid huge uproar by some opposition parties. It is now set to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
The Bill proposes to make the practice of instant triple talaq a punishable offence under the Indian Penal Code with the provision of a three-year jail term for the erring husband.
Earlier today, TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu also held a teleconference with his party MPs over the Bill and discussed the strategy to be adopted in the Rajya Sabha today.
""I have appealed to them (Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi) to obstruct the harassment of Muslims. All of them are united. All opposition parties should fight united against the anti-Muslim attitude of BJP. The government is forcibly imposing it. The triple talaq act is dangerous for secularism, national integrity and safety. All citizens should be considered under single Act. Separate acts for separate communities should not be there. Muslims should not be ill-treated,"" Naidu said.
""Already, attacks on minorities are increasing. Muslims are feeling insecure, which is harmful for the national integrity. Centre's acts should not be detrimental to nation's future. Non-BJP parties should unite, and save the rights of minorities. The greatness of Indian secularism should be raised. TDP MPs should raise their voice strongly in parliament for Muslims rights,"" he added.
On Sunday, Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP, AP Jithender Reddy had stated that the Centre under the pretext of protecting women's rights, is aiming to mess with the integrity of the country.
""Modifying religious practices is not the purpose of this House. This Bill is entirely arbitrary. We should ensure the integration of minority community into the majority, not alienate them. This Bill is misconceived,"" he added.
The issue of triple talaq was taken up in the Parliament in August last year, after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled ""unconstitutional"" a law that allows Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering ""talaq"" three times in quick succession.
In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the apex court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that triple talaq was an integral part of religious practice. (ANI)"

Division Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Harishankar clearly stated that the petition is maintainable and it is upto the petitioner to continue the matter here or wants to approach Supreme Court as several similar matters are already seized in the top court.
Petitioner Shahid Ali then decided to withdraw the PIL from Delhi High Court and speaking to ANI said he will approach Supreme Court soon.
The plea sought quashing/setting aside of Section 4 and 7 of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which makes pronouncement of Triple Talaq a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine under Section 4 of the Act.
Ali, a social activist, in his petition stated that though the Supreme Court had limited its judgment up to the declaration of triple divorce as unconstitutional and invalid, however, the Govt. went many steps further and not only declared the pronouncement of Triple Talaq as void and illegal but also has made the same a criminal offence, however, without making any arrangement in the said Act for reconciliation between the Muslim husband, pronouncing the Triple Talaq, and his wife.
The mere fact of not providing any measure for reconciliation in between the husband and his wife is ultra-vires to own statement of objects and reasons attached with the Act and also violative of the order of the Supreme Court, the plea states.
Petition further mentions that the present Act ""discriminate against Muslims also on the ground that, as submitted herein above, that the instances of desertions would be increased, In Indian society most of the aggrieved Hindu husbands on account of tough procedure of divorce, prefers to desert their wives and since desertions is no offence, therefore, they avoids the unhappy marriages, however, the Muslim husbands cannot desert their wives and also cannot go in adultery on account of commandment of Quran, therefore, it is submitted that the present Act will result in discrimination against Muslims.""

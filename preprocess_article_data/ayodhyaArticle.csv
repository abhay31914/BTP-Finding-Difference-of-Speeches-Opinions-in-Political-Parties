Leaders were seen inciting mobs to tear down the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya on a day that may have permanently changed for the worse the psyche of large sections of people in India – both in the minority and majority communities.
Come to think of it, BJP and Sangh Parivar leaders were caught on tape, caught on camera and caught in the eyes of thousands of people exhorting frenzied crowds to bludgeon and batter the masjid. Ek dhakka aur do – give one push more – had been the battle cry for many in the Parivar, each as obsessed as the foot soldiers they were leading not just to destroy a place of worship but the very fabric of communal harmony that clothed India.
This case did not need investigative prowess and intelligence gathering acumen as much as it needed the courage of conviction, grand principles of justice, an acute sense of what’s wrong and right – on the part of the governments, then and those that followed, and on the part of those handed the enormous responsibility of pinning blame on the clutch of people responsible for what must surely rank as one of India’s biggest blotches – along with the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the Godhra violence. 
It’s also startling and reeks of great indifference on the part of respective governments that the Liberhan Commission wasn’t given a strict deadline to finish off a probe that always tottered and never walked straight with the determination of direction. Or that MS Liberhan, the former Punjab and Haryana High Court judge, himself wasn’t changed when there was little to show for things even after a decade. That the end has come after a staggering 17 years, 48 extensions, 400 sittings and Rs 9 crore of public money is a marvel on its own. This can perhaps be tolerated only in India.
In his defence, Liberhan has said he got little cooperation from people who mattered. Though he added he will not name them right away. We may or never know who these people were, but don’t bet on it. Under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, the UPA government has six months to share in Parliament Liberhan’s findings and the action taken report. But, as TOI reported today, ""tabling of the report in the two Houses will depend on how swiftly the government wants to act on the recommendations"". 
If you ask me, the government will be in no hurry. Some players in the sordid saga are already dead, others too infirm, yet others have been completely marginalized during the time this report has seen the light of day. Taking action, even if this government gathers the guts to do it, will not mean the same anymore. Justice, like all things else, is only relevant when the injured party is agonizing about it. I get the feeling that the modern Muslim and the modern Hindu just wants to wash his hands of the blot, use a sanitizer to let go of the stench and move on. Good for the country. So, here’s hoping a place of worship is never attacked in India again, but in case there is such a tragedy, let’s hope the government works on a time frame to deliver its verdict on the sully, if not justice.

     It also took over two decades and even more to pin down Hitler's fascist collaborators.  Does this mean that fascism is gaining more tolerance within our society? Seemingly so. Hopefully the accused will be brought to trail soon....  Read More

1,1617655166-213,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Managing the CAA & NRC Imbroglio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/blunt-frank/managing-the-caa-nrc-imbroglio/,Managing the CAA & NRC Imbroglio,"December 26, 2019, 3:33 PM  IST","For the last six months, a small section of the 130 crores Indian society was itching to initiate nationwide protests against the government at the centre. Politicians from the opposition, misguided liberals and a few Muslim community leaders, who form this lobby, appeared to be a worried lot. Try as they may, the Modi juggernaut seemed to be having a free run. The frustration was writ large on their faces whenever they were seen on national television or elsewhere. They appeared to be powerless as the government went about its job of introducing some long-pending important legislations successfully one after the other.
It started with Triple Talaaq, then came the bombshell of abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A in the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir. Before they could recover, the BJP led government came trumps on the Ayodhya issue with Supreme Court ruling in favour of building a Ram Mandir on the disputed site. To their credit majority of Muslims accepted the verdict gracefully. Perhaps it was always clear that the Muslim community as a whole had little interest in Ayodhya dispute as it neither impacted their religion nor any of them individually in any manner. The hype around the issue was only the creation of some selfish community and religious leaders who wanted to exploit it to further their dubious leadership credentials.
The expected Muslim backlash, after these three events, was nowhere in sight. This really set the cat among the pigeons as far as the anti-government lobby was concerned. Most opposition leaders were worried that BJP and its allies would reap a lot of political mileage from all that had happened. No amount of political rhetoric, which ranged from base to crass, seemed to be working for the opposition and their sympathisers. They were itching to create hurdles and difficulties for the government but Indians thought otherwise and all efforts of the lobby came to a nought. Then came the fourth bombshell of Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA) passed by the parliament on 11 December 2019.
On the face of it, CAA was perhaps the least controversial issue in the list. But as events unfolded in its aftermath, it has become the most controversial one. The main reasons for this are lack of understanding by citizens and the success of the lobby in pushing it as an anti-Muslim bill. The lobby saw an opportunity to fan communal divide that could give them the much-awaited platform for nationwide protests. Many among the Muslim community were itching for a fight after their perceived humiliation and fears relating to Triple Talaaq Bill, changed status of J&K and Ayodhya judgement. Opposition’s strategy of starting with peaceful protests by students from Muslim dominated universities paid huge dividends. Starting from Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi, the protests spread to other campuses within days. Using students as a front, the opposition successfully infiltrated these protests and ensured that they turned violent. Local politicians, some student leaders and social activists ensured that passions ran high by delivering high decibel speeches laced with perceived fears of CAA being anti-Muslim in more ways than one. It is important to note here that a lot of young people, who are not Muslims, to have joined the protests as equality in word and spirit is genuinely important for them. Finally, after a long period of frustration, the lobby had found an issue to ride. The fears over NRC (National Register of Citizens) to being anti-Muslim added to the imbroglio.
Over the last two weeks, the government itself has made matters worse by confusing the public further through its statements on CAA, NRC and now NPR (National Population Register). Despite its honourable intentions, the government is on the back foot today because of its muddled position on this issue. The lobby has used this confusion caused by the government to its advantage by making the issue more perplexing for the common man. Government’s stand that is it CAA or NRC or NPR, all were the brainchild of previous Congress-led governments supported by the likes of Mamta Banerjee has not cut any ice with the public. In any case, it is time BJP leadership realises that today the onus for ensuring understanding and acceptance of the issue lies with them. If they try to pass the buck it will only result in loss of their credibility.
Maharashtra election results and formation of non-BJP government in the state has reaffirmed opposition’s faith in the need for forging alliances at all cost in every state to beat BJP. Jharkhand has gone the same way and despite being the largest party, BJP will have to sit in the opposition. Despite putting up a brave face BJP’s leadership must be a worried lot today. Emboldened by the protests, many Chief Ministers have openly stated that they will not implement CAA or NRC or NPR in their states. The legality or correctness of their statements is irrelevant here but the fact that such stand by states adds fuel to the raging protest fires cannot be overlooked These political developments have a lot to do with the intensity of the protests and the newfound confidence within opposition ranks.
In hindsight, it is obvious that CAA and NRC are just excuses. The real reason for the protests is the pent up frustration of part of the Muslim community because of their perceived fears of marginalisation and Hindu domination. One can argue, and perhaps rightly too, that all this is far from true and is baseless. However, it will not surprise anyone if an average Muslim, even if he is not involved in the protests directly, does harbour such fears with varying degrees of conviction. The anti-government lobby will leave no stone unturned to further this false narrative to increase Muslim apprehensions. In fact, given their pathetic run in the last five years, they have nothing to lose by doing so. A nation or what is good for the nation is farthest from their minds today. All that matters to them is how to stay relevant politically or otherwise.
Given the above environment, the responsibility for normalising the situation and confidence-building has to rest with the government. Is appeasement, as practised for nearly seven decades in the past, an answer? Perhaps not as it will be a very regressive approach. In fact, the current environment is partly a legacy of the appeasement policies of yesteryears. So what can the government do in this regard to normalise the situation? First, and that is perhaps not negotiable, is the fact that violence must be unacceptable and dealt with a heavy hand. Those responsible for such violence and damage to public or private property must be held accountable and dealt with in quick time. Political leaders, including those from the ruling party, and those from the social elite who masquerade as activists, responsible for inciting or spreading half-truths must be dealt with expeditiously. Last but not least, the government must institute measures to prevent the spread of fake news in media of all kinds.
Since protests started from students, it may be prudent to educate them to defeat fake narratives on CAA or NRC. University authorities must play an important part in this apart from well-meaning intellectuals and responsible citizens. Politicians and student unions should be kept out of such events as politicisation must be avoided at all costs. The government could consider issuing a gazette notification giving assurance to all citizens, irrespective of religion, regarding the safety of their citizenship status. Any exceptions in this regard must be stated clearly and must be specific to avoid any ambiguity. Once that is done it may be prudent for the government to prepare an NRC or NPR, whatever one may call it, based on the vast data already held with authorities in the form of Aadhar and Voter Cards since these are the most widely issued documents in the country. Where required these can be linked to PAN, driving licence, passports and property deeds by authorities themselves. Once that is done the authorities would only need to reconfirm the existence of that individual instead of asking him to prove his identity from scratch. This could easily be done as part of next census exercise in 2021. Only exceptions should be required to prove their identity from scratch which will be a much smaller and manageable exercise. Hopefully, these steps may allay a lot of unfounded fears that abound in many citizens today.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",for the last six months a small section of the 130 crores indian society was itching to initiate nationwide protests against the government at the centre politicians from the opposition misguided liberals and a few muslim community leaders who form this lobby appeared to be a worried lot try as they may the modi juggernaut seemed to be having a free run the frustration was writ large on their faces whenever they were seen on national television or elsewhere they appeared to be powerless as the government went about its job of introducing some longpending important legislations successfully one after the otherit started with triple talaaq then came the bombshell of abrogation of articles 370 and 35a in the erstwhile state of jammu  kashmir before they could recover the bjp led government came trumps on the ayodhya issue with supreme court ruling in favour of building a ram mandir on the disputed site to their credit majority of muslims accepted the verdict gracefully perhaps it was always clear that the muslim community as a whole had little interest in ayodhya dispute as it neither impacted their religion nor any of them individually in any manner the hype around the issue was only the creation of some selfish community and religious leaders who wanted to exploit it to further their dubious leadership credentialsthe expected muslim backlash after these three events was nowhere in sight this really set the cat among the pigeons as far as the antigovernment lobby was concerned most opposition leaders were worried that bjp and its allies would reap a lot of political mileage from all that had happened no amount of political rhetoric which ranged from base to crass seemed to be working for the opposition and their sympathisers they were itching to create hurdles and difficulties for the government but indians thought otherwise and all efforts of the lobby came to a nought then came the fourth bombshell of citizenship amendment bill caa passed by the parliament on 11 december 2019on the face of it caa was perhaps the least controversial issue in the list but as events unfolded in its aftermath it has become the most controversial one the main reasons for this are lack of understanding by citizens and the success of the lobby in pushing it as an antimuslim bill the lobby saw an opportunity to fan communal divide that could give them the muchawaited platform for nationwide protests many among the muslim community were itching for a fight after their perceived humiliation and fears relating to triple talaaq bill changed status of jk and ayodhya judgement oppositions strategy of starting with peaceful protests by students from muslim dominated universities paid huge dividends starting from jamia milia islamia in delhi the protests spread to other campuses within days using students as a front the opposition successfully infiltrated these protests and ensured that they turned violent local politicians some student leaders and social activists ensured that passions ran high by delivering high decibel speeches laced with perceived fears of caa being antimuslim in more ways than one it is important to note here that a lot of young people who are not muslims to have joined the protests as equality in word and spirit is genuinely important for them finally after a long period of frustration the lobby had found an issue to ride the fears over nrc national register of citizens to being antimuslim added to the imbroglioover the last two weeks the government itself has made matters worse by confusing the public further through its statements on caa nrc and now npr national population register despite its honourable intentions the government is on the back foot today because of its muddled position on this issue the lobby has used this confusion caused by the government to its advantage by making the issue more perplexing for the common man governments stand that is it caa or nrc or npr all were the brainchild of previous congressled governments supported by the likes of mamta banerjee has not cut any ice with the public in any case it is time bjp leadership realises that today the onus for ensuring understanding and acceptance of the issue lies with them if they try to pass the buck it will only result in loss of their credibilitymaharashtra election results and formation of nonbjp government in the state has reaffirmed oppositions faith in the need for forging alliances at all cost in every state to beat bjp jharkhand has gone the same way and despite being the largest party bjp will have to sit in the opposition despite putting up a brave face bjps leadership must be a worried lot today emboldened by the protests many chief ministers have openly stated that they will not implement caa or nrc or npr in their states the legality or correctness of their statements is irrelevant here but the fact that such stand by states adds fuel to the raging protest fires cannot be overlooked these political developments have a lot to do with the intensity of the protests and the newfound confidence within opposition ranksin hindsight it is obvious that caa and nrc are just excuses the real reason for the protests is the pent up frustration of part of the muslim community because of their perceived fears of marginalisation and hindu domination one can argue and perhaps rightly too that all this is far from true and is baseless however it will not surprise anyone if an average muslim even if he is not involved in the protests directly does harbour such fears with varying degrees of conviction the antigovernment lobby will leave no stone unturned to further this false narrative to increase muslim apprehensions in fact given their pathetic run in the last five years they have nothing to lose by doing so a nation or what is good for the nation is farthest from their minds today all that matters to them is how to stay relevant politically or otherwisegiven the above environment the responsibility for normalising the situation and confidencebuilding has to rest with the government is appeasement as practised for nearly seven decades in the past an answer perhaps not as it will be a very regressive approach in fact the current environment is partly a legacy of the appeasement policies of yesteryears so what can the government do in this regard to normalise the situation first and that is perhaps not negotiable is the fact that violence must be unacceptable and dealt with a heavy hand those responsible for such violence and damage to public or private property must be held accountable and dealt with in quick time political leaders including those from the ruling party and those from the social elite who masquerade as activists responsible for inciting or spreading halftruths must be dealt with expeditiously last but not least the government must institute measures to prevent the spread of fake news in media of all kindssince protests started from students it may be prudent to educate them to defeat fake narratives on caa or nrc university authorities must play an important part in this apart from wellmeaning intellectuals and responsible citizens politicians and student unions should be kept out of such events as politicisation must be avoided at all costs the government could consider issuing a gazette notification giving assurance to all citizens irrespective of religion regarding the safety of their citizenship status any exceptions in this regard must be stated clearly and must be specific to avoid any ambiguity once that is done it may be prudent for the government to prepare an nrc or npr whatever one may call it based on the vast data already held with authorities in the form of aadhar and voter cards since these are the most widely issued documents in the country where required these can be linked to pan driving licence passports and property deeds by authorities themselves once that is done the authorities would only need to reconfirm the existence of that individual instead of asking him to prove his identity from scratch this could easily be done as part of next census exercise in 2021 only exceptions should be required to prove their identity from scratch which will be a much smaller and manageable exercise hopefully these steps may allay a lot of unfounded fears that abound in many citizens today

The election will decide who will be at the helm in Sri Lanka for the next five years.
<img src=""https://epaper.timesgroup.com/Olive/ODN/TimesOfIndia/get/TOICH-2019-11-12/image.ashx?kind=block&amp;href=TOICH%2F2019%2F11%2F12&amp;id=Pc0060800&amp;ext=.jpg&amp;ts=20191112030203"" width=""580"" height=""400"" class=""amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height"">
Internationally, Sri Lanka has emerged as the strategic pivot for China to assert its military and economic power in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). China’s influence is to make further headway with the progress of the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative in the region. These developments have become a source of major concern to India as its national security is tied with Sri Lanka by geography. Growing Chinese power in IOR has increased the concern to the USA and its East Asian and European allies, dominating the Indo-Pacific.
The election is being held at a time when the country’s governance has taken a beating ever since President Maithripala Sirisena made an abortive attempt in October 2018 to replace Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The infighting between the two exposed serious deficiencies in national security with the April 21 Easter Sunday attacks costing more than 253 lives. The anti-Muslim backlash highlighted the potential threat of religious extremism getting out of hand. These events overshadowed some of the achievements of the government, which came to power promising good governance. The country is facing severe economic pressure compounded by growing debt servicing load, high cost of living and unemployment. Alleged war crimes and forced disappearance issues after the Eelam war continue. The election will also decide whether former president Mahinda Rajapaksa will emerge powerful again.
Of the 35 candidates, the real contest is between 70-year-old Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the controversial former defence secretary and brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa, 52, housing minister and son of former president Ranasinghe Premadasa. Gotabaya, fielded by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna led by Mahinda, has Sinhala Buddhist nationalists as his support base. On the other hand, Gotabaya’s reputation as an authoritarian figure with disdain for democratic norms, humanitarian laws and rule of law dogs him. Gotabaya’s manifesto released on Oct 25 focuses on national security and restoring stability after the failure the present regime to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks. The government plans to work with India for regional security and engage with SAARC and BIMSTEC groupings.
In contrast, Sajith Premadasa, deputy chairman of the ruling United National Party (UNP), fielded by the New Democratic Front is a non-controversial personality. His father Ranasinghe Premadasa came from humble beginnings rose to become PM and then President.
Since 2000, Sajith has been elected to parliament four times. Sajith has followed in his father’s footsteps by focusing on development youth and the downtrodden. Apart from the UNP, which usually enjoys the support of a third of voters, Sajith is supported by two prominent Muslim parties — Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and All Ceylon Makkal Congress, the Tamil Progressive Alliance formed by Tamils of Indian origin and the Jathika Hela Urumaya, popularly known as monks party. Former president Chandrika Kumaratunge and her group within the SLFP has also pledged their support to Sajith.
Sajith’s manifesto appears to have more depth, having learned from the aberrations of the outgoing Sirisena government’s failure to deliver on its promises. The manifesto pledged a new constitution to create a strong nation with a judiciary independent of the government, independent public prosecutor appointed by the Constitutional Council. The manifesto also envisaged the creation of an upper house comprising provincial council representatives. Of interest to minorities are the introduction of new laws to monitor religious extremism, penalising hate speech, resettlement of war displaced persons and “meaningful devolution” of powers to provinces. This last promise tipped the scales in his favour for the Tamil political parties, who were caught in a dilemma in deciding whom to support as Gotabaya’s manifesto which smacked of militarism.
As a neighbour, India would prefer a politically and economically stable Sri Lanka, to build upon existing cooperation in national security and trade between the two countries. At the same time, India is wary of China’s use of Sri Lanka as a springboard to further its military advantage as well as commercial edge in South Asia. The Easter Sunday attacks have shown the need for close cooperation between the nations to combat terrrorism. The Rajapaksa rule had shown a tilt towards China, ostensibly to develop infrastructure using its help; however, the country has been burdened with huge debts. If Gotabaya wins, India may have to get Sri Lanka to strike a balance in its relationship with India and China.

3,1617655295-245,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,As the year goes by,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/long-short/as-the-year-goes-by/,As the year goes by,"December 26, 2019, 10:46 AM  IST","Year 2019 has been eventful for the India: Pulwama, Balakot, 17 th Lok Sabha, Article 370, Hyderabad Nirbhaya, Ayodhya verdict and NRC-CAA. Each of these events have ramifications beyond the immediate.
The Pulwama terrorist attack, Balakot air strike and Lok Sabha election results happened not just sequentially but also consequentially. Pulwama provided the justification for Balakot. Questions about intelligence failure in Pulwama and doubts on efficacy of Balakot strike notwithstanding, public euphoria at the muscular response and rhetoric against cross border terrorism carried itself to the hustings.
Attention then turned homewards where Kashmir theatre provided the best acoustics for the loudest bang. Article 370 of the Constitution was abated. There were celebrations in rest of the country that the Kashmir imbroglio has been settled for good. Just how good will be known only after the valley is released from lockdown.
The Hyderabad Nirbhhaya event shocked the nation — one more time! Public bayed for blood of the perpetrators and scalp of the police. Four persons were arrested and within days all of them killed in an encounter. The police which had been at the receiving end till then, was showered upon with flower petals. The encounter has all the signs of being premeditated, but it is exactly for that a large section of the public congratulated the police. While frustration with the criminal justice system is understandable, advocating extra-judicial killing as the mode of justice delivery is fraught with grave danger. How can the police steeped as it is in corruption be trusted to turn soldier saints only when dealing with rapists? Where is the guarantee that powerful quarters will not bribe the police to pick-up petty criminals, label them as accused and eliminate them in a staged encounter to bring closer to the case while the actual rapists go scot free? A disturbing trend in social media has been to congratulate the police for this encounter while blaming the courts for delayed justice in other cases. In this, is there a message for the judiciary which is perhaps the last constitutional bastion that has not yet succumbed to the executive?
The verdict of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya dispute is a landmark judgement. Though holding that desecration of the mosque by placing idols in 1949 and its destruction in 1992 was against the law, it allotted the entire disputed land for temple construction and ordered allotment of alternate site for a mosque. While the verdict has brought down the curtain on a longstanding dispute, it is hoped it has not raised any for mischief elsewhere.
The calendar will turn to a new year with the agitation against NRC-CAA continuing. India does have a problem of illegal immigrants particularly in certain parts and like any other country has the right to create a register of citizens. However, the process should not be discriminatory or unduly torturous. The NRC exercise in Assam was quite tormenting and admittedly erroneous though perhaps not discriminatory. Instead of learning from the Assam experience, government functionaries chose to declare the intent of repeating the same throughout the country adding to it the feature of religious discrimination in the form of CAA. Whether intentionally or not, chest thumping advocacy of NRC has sharpened polarization and made the exercise appear more sinister than what it could be. In any case, it is the poor of all communities who will be most hard pressed to adduce documentary proof of citizenship. All in all, the responsibility of detecting illegal immigrants is getting transferred from the government machinery to hapless citizens in a manner that they would stand guilty unless proven otherwise by their own effort.
Among all this, the glory of Abhijit Banerjee winning the Nobel should not be forgotten. His political views being well known, social media was flush with personal attacks on him as soon as the prize was announced. He then had a meeting with the prime minister after which they complemented each other with complimentary references. Lo and behold, the scurrilous posts stopped abruptly leaving not much to guess what could have been their inspirational source. Banerjee has since fortified his nationalist credentials by wearing a dhoti to the Nobel award ceremony while his non-Indian wife wore a saree. However, he must continue to remain cautious as at present it is impossible to make any pertinent comment on the Indian economy without offending the powers that be.

4,1617655214-226,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The day a community’s pride was hurt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/strategic-insights/the-day-a-communitys-pride-was-hurt/,The day a community’s pride was hurt,"August 9, 2020, 11:03 PM  IST","It was August 5, 2020. Times Square in New York had been rented to promote Hindutva (Hinduness). There were functions held in numerous western capitals. All of India was agog.
Except for India’s 200-million strong Muslim minority. Their mosque, the Babri Masjid, was torn down by Hindu zealots in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. Many Hindus alleged that the mosque had been built by in turn tearing down a Hindu temple. So they wanted the temple restored.
Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister for the second time in 2019. Some months after his reelection, the Indian Supreme Court in a judgment dated November 9, 2019, stated that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was illegal. It also said that there was no evidence to suggest that a Hindu structure stood underneath the mosque.
Yet, the Court handed over the disputed land to Hindus to construct their temple, while at the same time awarding a large tract of land in Ayodhya for the construction of a new mosque. Modi hailed the verdict in his by now all-too-familiar television addresses.
I am a Hindu. A devout Hindu. Perhaps not as devout a Hindu as Mahatma Gandhi, the founding father of India. Yet Gandhi gave his life for India’s Muslims. Gandhi hails from the Indian state of Gujarat, the state of Modi. In his office, Modi has a statuette of Gandhi.
But does Modi follow Gandhi’s ideals? India is one of the biggest, most-diverse nations on earth. Gandhi wanted India to strictly separate church from state, and handed India to the atheist Jawaharlal Nehru to run for close to two decades. In 1984, there was a watershed election. The Hindu right, almost always marginalized until then, won only two seats in parliament.
They didn’t know where to look. Their leader, LK Advani, latched onto the temple-mosque issue to gain power. It became a matter of pride for Hindus. Hindu pride.
But Hindu pride is not like white pride. Hinduism is one of the world’s oldest and one of the most peaceful religions in the world. Unlike some other religious groups, Hindus do not proselytize. Circa 1000 AD, Muslim invaders started arriving in the subcontinent and by 1200 AD they had captured almost all of India.
They ruled uninterrupted until the British arrived in the mid-eighteenth century. Nehru himself acknowledges in his Independence Day speech on the night of August 14, 1947, that the soul of India had been long suppressed. By the soul of India he meant the soul of India’s Hindus.
But Gandhi wanted every wind to sweep through the house of India. Advani stirred and shook the nation with a violent, traumatic journey across the country in 1992 to promote the temple. His party’s seats grew to almost a hundred, still nowhere near enough to form a government.
But he knew he was on the right track. In 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the PM, and in 2014, Modi. Modi marginalized him and made him a part of the path-showing council, which is neither path-showing nor a council. It is defunct. Advani, the architect of Hindutva, was made defunct. Power does that.
He did not attend the foundation laying ceremony of the temple in Ayodhya. Maybe because it’s because of Covid, maybe because Modi did not want him to. Modi was of course the chief guest. This was not a Hindutva opportunity to be missed.
As many of India’s exult, almost all of India’s Muslims cow down in shame. Modi’s regime has not been kind to them. Cow vigilantism has led to numerous attacks of lynchings on India’s Muslims. The Muslim majority-state of Kashmir has been under a brutal lockdown for a year. Modi has given refuge in India to persecuted minorities in India’s neighborhood like Hindus, Sikhs and even Christians (in a sign of clear concession to the West), but not to Muslims.
Today the Indian Muslim lies almost comatose. He is at the bottom of the country’s societal and economic totem pole. No real programs are launched to help him. Many Hindus rejoice at his fate, who they consider their former tormentor.
The Babri Masjid was built circa 1520, almost five hundred years ago. Modi’s supporters say that with the construction of the temple, he has accomplished what no one had for five hundred years. But India’s soul is being torn apart. Gandhi’s ashes are being singed.
Modi’s supporters mock Hindus like me to be bad Hindus, just as Trump’s supporters mock liberal whites to be bad whites. But what would Modi say about Gandhi? Does he pray to him only to show the world, while internally he regards him as a relic. Gandhi won India its freedom. Why not let his thoughts linger on for a while? Must we all breathe from the putrid stench of hate.

     ""The supreme court also said that there was no evidence to suggest that a Hindu structure stood underneath the mosque."" I don't know how you can so blatantly and shamelessly lie on a public forum, when one of the main pillars of the judgement of the supreme court is the report by the archaeological survey of India which confirmed that there is indeed a temple structure underneath the mosque. Listen to the talk by Mr. KK Muhammed. Kaha se aathe hai aise log.. Pathetic....  Read More

5,1617655375-266,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,End in sight: A golden opportunity to settle the Ayodhya dispute beckons the Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/end-in-sight-a-golden-opportunity-to-settle-the-ayodhya-dispute-beckons-the-supreme-court/,End in sight: A golden opportunity to settle the Ayodhya dispute beckons the Supreme Court,"September 18, 2019, 8:15 PM  IST","Hopes of a judicial settlement of the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi title dispute have brightened with Supreme Court setting an October 18 deadline for both sides to conclude arguments. That would give the present bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi a month to pronounce its verdict before he retires. The court has also allowed mediation efforts to continue concurrently. Given the tortuous course that the agitation for the Ram Mandir and the litigation have taken, the ongoing SC hearings represent the best opportunity to settle the dispute for all time.
For one, judiciary, unlike the political executive, has no gallery to play to and is ideally placed to ensure everyone abides by its decision. It is the political executive’s failings since the 1980s which ensured that a local dispute flared up into an issue that threatened national integrity. But SC must avoid the pitfalls that undermined the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment when it partitioned the disputed land three ways between the Hindu and Muslim parties. While staying the Allahabad HC judgment in 2011, an SC bench had criticised the verdict’s overt reliance on mythology as a “leap of faith”.
The present bench mustn’t fall into the same trap and must go solely by legal principles when deciding the title suit. Nearly 27 years after Babri Masjid was demolished, most citizens are wary and weary over the continuance of such disputes. It is unfortunate that mediation failed to find a middle ground between the litigants. While the apex court must arrive at a decision based on the law as well as the constitutional principle of equality of all religions, it is also important that a political consensus is forged to implement the apex court order on Ayodhya, irrespective of who it may displease — else India will be on the road towards becoming ungovernable.

     My biggest worry is that the Supreme Court might resort to Muslim appeasement. Also, why is it the case that the Sunni Waqf board owns or claims to own so much property/land in India? Who gave them that? Did the British give them that right? If they did, then an independent India should have re-evaluated those allocations. This is another fraud being played on Indians. India must reclaim its land....  Read More

6,1617655320-251,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"Democracy, not a mosque, the prize at Ayodhya",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/cursor/democracy-not-a-mosque-the/,"Democracy, not a mosque, the prize at Ayodhya","September 24, 2010, 8:45 PM  IST","The courts cannot settle the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, only politics can. And this is not a question of striking some compromise between rival litigants in the title suits over the piece of land on which the Babri mosque stood till December 6, 1992 and which many Hindus believe to be the birth place of Lord Ram. Nor is it a question of some religious or political leaders deciding to bury the hatchet.
The solution to a dispute like this one lies in more robust democracy, and building that is a protracted business. The response of the mainstream political parties and of the Muslim community should be designed to strengthen the process of building democracy, not to disrupt it.
The rights of India’s minorities are best protected by reinforcing democracy, not by patronage of one political party or another. Leaders of the Muslim community should refuse to accept the profuse, insistent offers of patronage that assorted political parties and leaders are guaranteed to extend in the wake of the court verdict on the disputed site.
No major organised violence is likely to greet the court verdict, whichever way it goes. And this is not just because those who lose the case in the high court have the option of going on appeal to the Supreme Court. Building a Ram temple has always been a secondary goal of the movement that the Sangh Parivar kicked off in 1982 through the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The principal, tangible goal was to demolish the mosque, not to build a temple in its place. The temple motif was brought in only to mobilise support.
The Ayodhya movement that polarised the polity on communal lines, caused riots and killed people was a political movement, not one of faith, although it manipulated faith to subserve its political goal. Through the immediate, tangible goal of demolishing the mosque, the movement pursued the larger objective of the Sangh Parivar, of redefining Indian nationhood as Hindutva.
Demolishing the mosque, overriding the protection offered by different organs of the constitutional Republic, would demonstrate to the Muslim community where exactly it stood vis-à-vis the relations of power that govern society and its conduct. And this goal was achieved when a mob brought the mosque down.
That marked a rupture in the evolution of India’s polity. The state failed to live up to the constitutional promise to uphold law and order, as well as the rights of the minority. If uppity minorities still refused to appreciate the import of what this meant for how they should conduct themselves in Hindu majority India, they would be taught further lessons, such as the Gujarat pogrom of 2002 and the attack on Christians in Kandhamal, Orissa, in 2007 and 2008.
The state, led by one member of the Parivar, would look the other way, if not actually aid the attackers organised as other Parivar members. This is the politics of the Sangh Parivar. This politics continues today, although it has virtually left behind the specific locus of Ayodhya. The project of creating a democratic polity that guarantees and protects the rights of religious minorities to live with dignity is alien to the Sangh Parivar’s majoritarian vision of privileging Hindus over others in political rights.
It would be a mistake to think that, just because one member of the Parivar, the BJP, has received a setback at the moment, the Sangh Parivar has lost its teeth or that the threat posed by its majoritarian ideology to the project of building constitutional democracy has abated.
India’s mainstream political parties, including the Congress, have been opportunistically communal on various occasions, and this has helped the Sangh Parivar’s cause.
This is the context in which the Muslim leadership has to respond to the Ayodhya verdict. No issue of faith is at stake for Muslims at Ayodhya. The issue at stake is political. And asserting a property right is a small detail in the appropriate political project of building democracy.
Moving to build a mosque at the site or to remove the Ram idols being worshipped in a makeshift temple there would hurt the process of building democracy. It would give the Parivar an opportunity to whip up religious passions again. So, even if the high court decides in favour of the Sunni Waqf Board, it should not proceed in this direction.
Should the Muslims graciously hand over the land for a Ram temple to be built? The loser’s magnanimity has few takers; rather, it is seen as a sign of weakness. Winning a case is a minor victory in a larger political battle where the democratic ground lost by the demolition of the mosque is yet to be regained. And a show of weakness, too, would be a setback for the democratic project. a
When Indian democracy evolves to a level of maturity where the security of no religious identity depends on a physical edifice, then would be the time to give priority to faith over politics in deciding what to build at the Ayodhya site. Till then, the status quo will do quite nicely.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",the courts cannot settle the ram janmabhoomi dispute only politics can and this is not a question of striking some compromise between rival litigants in the title suits over the piece of land on which the babri mosque stood till december 6 1992 and which many hindus believe to be the birth place of lord ram nor is it a question of some religious or political leaders deciding to bury the hatchetthe solution to a dispute like this one lies in more robust democracy and building that is a protracted business the response of the mainstream political parties and of the muslim community should be designed to strengthen the process of building democracy not to disrupt itthe rights of indias minorities are best protected by reinforcing democracy not by patronage of one political party or another leaders of the muslim community should refuse to accept the profuse insistent offers of patronage that assorted political parties and leaders are guaranteed to extend in the wake of the court verdict on the disputed siteno major organised violence is likely to greet the court verdict whichever way it goes and this is not just because those who lose the case in the high court have the option of going on appeal to the supreme court building a ram temple has always been a secondary goal of the movement that the sangh parivar kicked off in 1982 through the vishwa hindu parishad the principal tangible goal was to demolish the mosque not to build a temple in its place the temple motif was brought in only to mobilise supportthe ayodhya movement that polarised the polity on communal lines caused riots and killed people was a political movement not one of faith although it manipulated faith to subserve its political goal through the immediate tangible goal of demolishing the mosque the movement pursued the larger objective of the sangh parivar of redefining indian nationhood as hindutvademolishing the mosque overriding the protection offered by different organs of the constitutional republic would demonstrate to the muslim community where exactly it stood visàvis the relations of power that govern society and its conduct and this goal was achieved when a mob brought the mosque downthat marked a rupture in the evolution of indias polity the state failed to live up to the constitutional promise to uphold law and order as well as the rights of the minority if uppity minorities still refused to appreciate the import of what this meant for how they should conduct themselves in hindu majority india they would be taught further lessons such as the gujarat pogrom of 2002 and the attack on christians in kandhamal orissa in 2007 and 2008the state led by one member of the parivar would look the other way if not actually aid the attackers organised as other parivar members this is the politics of the sangh parivar this politics continues today although it has virtually left behind the specific locus of ayodhya the project of creating a democratic polity that guarantees and protects the rights of religious minorities to live with dignity is alien to the sangh parivars majoritarian vision of privileging hindus over others in political rightsit would be a mistake to think that just because one member of the parivar the bjp has received a setback at the moment the sangh parivar has lost its teeth or that the threat posed by its majoritarian ideology to the project of building constitutional democracy has abatedindias mainstream political parties including the congress have been opportunistically communal on various occasions and this has helped the sangh parivars causethis is the context in which the muslim leadership has to respond to the ayodhya verdict no issue of faith is at stake for muslims at ayodhya the issue at stake is political and asserting a property right is a small detail in the appropriate political project of building democracymoving to build a mosque at the site or to remove the ram idols being worshipped in a makeshift temple there would hurt the process of building democracy it would give the parivar an opportunity to whip up religious passions again so even if the high court decides in favour of the sunni waqf board it should not proceed in this directionshould the muslims graciously hand over the land for a ram temple to be built the losers magnanimity has few takers rather it is seen as a sign of weakness winning a case is a minor victory in a larger political battle where the democratic ground lost by the demolition of the mosque is yet to be regained and a show of weakness too would be a setback for the democratic project awhen indian democracy evolves to a level of maturity where the security of no religious identity depends on a physical edifice then would be the time to give priority to faith over politics in deciding what to build at the ayodhya site till then the status quo will do quite nicely

8,1617655173-215,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,A fifteen-day fight!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/a-fifteen-day-fight/,A fifteen-day fight!,"March 23, 2020, 7:30 PM  IST","As I was preparing to pen down my thoughts on corona, I saw this big bang announcement on television channels … UP govt cancels the Ramanavami celebrations in Ayodhya..it was the first ramnavami after the apex court verdict on the Rama’s birthplace temple site and a lot of people would have thronged to Ayodhya for this historic once in a lifetime occasion…the state government must be applauded to have the grit to take this decision as there would have been people who would have questioned it or perhaps in favour of scaling down celebrations…but at a time when the world is fighting the corona menace with all its might n resolve, anything short of cancelling this function would have been adequate.
First, let’s get some of our basics on the corona right … this is, without doubt, the biggest public health emergency in last 100 years at the least… let’s not fool ourselves or be in a stage of denial…it could be catastrophic…it has affected 150 plus countries till now and the graph is still on a rise…no vaccine or medicine which can assure cure is in sight and all are in a trial mode…the most advanced centres of the world with the best facilities are working very hard but till date there isn’t a reason to be complacent…the only way out is precaution and prevention by a multi-pronged approach and we have in hand the experiences of some of the countries which have fought this menace better than the others…we have the example of South Korea which had 8500 cases but with35 casualties… compare this with Italy which has had 35000 cases with almost 3500 deaths….Spain with 10000 cases and 800 deaths whereas Germany with 12000 cases and 50 deaths by far…The figures are both alarming as well as reassuring … if South Korea can do it why can’t we…I have been to Seoul and its pretty much same as Delhi or Mumbai…
Let’s come to the Indian scenario now…200 cases and 5 mortalities…things are well in control as of now…but as I speak and interact with my batch mates and friends from the medical fraternity I do sense apprehension and fear as to where we go from here….in my 27  years since I joined medicine way back in 1992, I have never seen such a concern in the medical fraternity…as medical students, we had worked in one of the best medical schools of the country, when HIV was at its peak and growing but I very vividly remember my teachers in medicine would perform surgeries on known patients without much apprehensions with due precautions in place…What makes the coronavirus different from any other virus is its very contagious and one person even though asymptomatic can infect many hundred others in a short span…the South Korean patient is an example very well known now…if this kind of pattern starts happening in India, in a very short span our number of cases would shoot…we have to prevent this at any cost…as public health experts rightly put, we are still in stage 2 with local transmission, but if not handled effectively, in no time it would go in the third stage…Some very eminent doctors and leaders in medicine like Dr. Naresh Trehan and Dr Debishetty are repeatedly emphasizing on this…
One must say that till now this entire Corona challenge has been handled extremely well and very professionally by the government machinery and the health care leaders and workers in India….the first case was detected on 30th January and since then our total count as of today is around 200 after a good 50 days…but as they say in medicine at times it’s better to overdo the treatment and precautions than underdo it…my personal belief is that the same principle must be continued and more strictly adhered to for the next 15 days at the least…the JANTA CURFEW which be the honourable prime minister appealed for has been taken well by one and all and am sure that it will be continued for couple of weeks more…there cannot be anything less than a total shutdown of economic activity for the next 15 days if steps like social distancing, hand washing, quarantine have to yield desired results…canceling international flights and arrival for the next 15 days is every positive step in the right direction…public transport, restaurants, shops, and many such non-essential activities must be shut with immediate effect…some states have taken the decision in this regard but there isn’t a uniform policy on this…cities are more vulnerable than countrysides for many reasons…we will have to get this across to the masses that its not life as usual for the next couple of months…at the same time it’s the responsibility of the affluent to take care of the people dependent on them and not adhere to strict attendance as the economic insecurity amongst the daily wage earners have to be addressed.. Economic activity would slow down drastically for a couple of months but its imperative and the long term economic gains would be worth this reduction if we are able to fight this corona war successfully…
As in any major community struggle, I firmly believe it’s the educated middle class which has to lead from the front…it’s a war of numbers which has to reach to as many people as possible…through the medium of information technology the huge numbers in India can be both sensitised and educated..that’s where the role and purpose of work from home can have its maximum benefits…it won’t be easy to send the message of economic let down to the masses easily but that is what would make substantive difference…Sun Shuo PENG , HEAD of a Chinese red cross delegation that visited Italy said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out…governments have a limited role in this ..this works also as a demonstration effect…if people see life as usual, more n more are encouraged to go out for not very pressing reasons…this must be stopped and discouraged…I must personally cite two anecdotes to make my point across…I friend of mine called me to invite me to a birthday party of his child…I tried to reason out with him that it wasn’t the right time to hold a party and that he must thinkover..within half an hour I got a message from him that he has cancelled the party…on the contrary, when I called a relative of mine,a responsible educated person, he smartly conveyed that he had booked a flight bto vaishno devi n was planning to go there in a couple of days… I tried to reason out with him but he was reluctant to cancel his trip… thankfully after six hours, I forwarded him the news of the closure of the vaishno devi shrine..both would have incurred some financial loss, but then the life and safety of self and ones loved ones are more important than some financial damage…it’s the second kind of thought process that needs to be discouraged… all non-essential travels must be totally stopped…
There is another school of thought which says,..don’t panic….while agree in principle with this attitude, I would modify this a bit…I bit of nervousness is a sign of how serious one is about an issue…I remember during my medical college examinations, when we would say I am nervous, our seniors would suggest that that is good…as that shows you have done preparations…one who is prepared seriously and systematically is a bit nervous… it’s not life as usual…if people in personal cars would go out for casual drives with there families, they would be followed by people in bikes and then the next would be ones using public transport…all have to act responsibly and patiently… also as the prime minister said that this thought that this can’t happen to me is further from truth…I again reemphasize on the next 15 days because if we are able to contain the total numbers to less than 1000 in the next fifteen days, the spike would into a plateau and it will not unduly put pressure on our health infrastructure…even the government and private combined have limited ICUs, ventilators, advanced care setups even in the best of cities… the population of the elderly too is not very insignificant… some state governments have acted promptly and professionally than the others…the government of Maharastra, Uttarakhand and Delhi have been quick enough in realising the problem and responding effectively…while other states too must have acted, but we need to show a more determined and resolute approach…
Now, last and the most important, the morale and the resolve of all the health care workers doctors, nurses, other staff have to be kept high and their spirits sustained… we can do this by providing them with all the logistic support they need for taking care of Covid-19 positive patients…the n-95 face mask, the personal protective equipment (PPE), goggles, gloves etc should be in abundant supply…the supply chain of these are very vital to keep the motivation levels of all the people who are risking there lives and dealing with such high-risk groups be it the police in there usual duties or the airlines’ staff, customs, immigration etc at the airports…as I was discussing this issue with a batchmate of mine who is a consultant in Mumbai, conveyed that there were concerns of a shortage of N-95 masks…more than the shortage there is also a tendency to hoard the essential item and then sell them with extremes margin of profit…such unethical profiteerings must be sternly discouraged in this our of crisis….no battle or war can be won if we cannot provide an uninterrupted supply of equipment etc to our soldiers.
And as I conclude, another news flash that a Bollywood singer, back from London just 10 days back, joined parties attended by high profile guests have tested positive for Covid19. This approach in itself speaks for the kind of responsibility we exhibit collectively as citizens at the time of an unprecedented national health emergency. To end on a positive note, China for the second consecutive day has reported NIL corona case. A ray of hope, a silver lining in the dark clouds with a very firm belief that this too shall pass!

historic once in a lifetime occasion…the state government must be applauded to have the grit to take this decision as there would have been people who would have questioned it or perhaps in favour of scaling down celebrations…but at a time when the world is fighting the corona menace with all its might n resolve anything short of cancelling this function would have been adequatefirst lets get some of our basics on the corona right … this is without doubt the biggest public health emergency in last 100 years at the least… lets not fool ourselves or be in a stage of denial…it could be catastrophic…it has affected 150 plus countries till now and the graph is still on a rise…no vaccine or medicine which can assure cure is in sight and all are in a trial mode…the most advanced centres of the world with the best facilities are working very hard but till date there isnt a reason to be complacent…the only way out is precaution and prevention by a multipronged approach and we have in hand the experiences of some of the countries which have fought this menace better than the others…we have the example of south korea which had 8500 cases but with35 casualties… compare this with italy which has had 35000 cases with almost 3500 deaths…spain with 10000 cases and 800 deaths whereas germany with 12000 cases and 50 deaths by far…the figures are both alarming as well as reassuring … if south korea can do it why cant we…i have been to seoul and its pretty much same as delhi or mumbai…lets come to the indian scenario now…200 cases and 5 mortalities…things are well in control as of now…but as i speak and interact with my batch mates and friends from the medical fraternity i do sense apprehension and fear as to where we go from here…in my 27  years since i joined medicine way back in 1992 i have never seen such a concern in the medical fraternity…as medical students we had worked in one of the best medical schools of the country when hiv was at its peak and growing but i very vividly remember my teachers in medicine would perform surgeries on known patients without much apprehensions with due precautions in place…what makes the coronavirus different from any other virus is its very contagious and one person even though asymptomatic can infect many hundred others in a short span…the south korean patient is an example very well known now…if this kind of pattern starts happening in india in a very short span our number of cases would shoot…we have to prevent this at any cost…as public health experts rightly put we are still in stage 2 with local transmission but if not handled effectively in no time it would go in the third stage…some very eminent doctors and leaders in medicine like dr naresh trehan and dr debishetty are repeatedly emphasizing on this…one must say that till now this entire corona challenge has been handled extremely well and very professionally by the government machinery and the health care leaders and workers in india…the first case was detected on 30th january and since then our total count as of today is around 200 after a good 50 days…but as they say in medicine at times its better to overdo the treatment and precautions than underdo it…my personal belief is that the same principle must be continued and more strictly adhered to for the next 15 days at the least…the janta curfew which be the honourable prime minister appealed for has been taken well by one and all and am sure that it will be continued for couple of weeks more…there cannot be anything less than a total shutdown of economic activity for the next 15 days if steps like social distancing hand washing quarantine have to yield desired results…canceling international flights and arrival for the next 15 days is every positive step in the right direction…public transport restaurants shops and many such nonessential activities must be shut with immediate effect…some states have taken the decision in this regard but there isnt a uniform policy on this…cities are more vulnerable than countrysides for many reasons…we will have to get this across to the masses that its not life as usual for the next couple of months…at the same time its the responsibility of the affluent to take care of the people dependent on them and not adhere to strict attendance as the economic insecurity amongst the daily wage earners have to be addressed economic activity would slow down drastically for a couple of months but its imperative and the long term economic gains would be worth this reduction if we are able to fight this corona war successfully…as in any major community struggle i firmly believe its the educated middle class which has to lead from the front…its a war of numbers which has to reach to as many people as possible…through the medium of information technology the huge numbers in india can be both sensitised and educatedthats where the role and purpose of work from home can have its maximum benefits…it wont be easy to send the message of economic let down to the masses easily but that is what would make substantive difference…sun shuo peng  head of a chinese red cross delegation that visited italy said he was shocked to see so many people walking around using public transportation and eating out…governments have a limited role in this this works also as a demonstration effect…if people see life as usual more n more are encouraged to go out for not very pressing reasons…this must be stopped and discouraged…i must personally cite two anecdotes to make my point across…i friend of mine called me to invite me to a birthday party of his child…i tried to reason out with him that it wasnt the right time to hold a party and that he must thinkoverwithin half an hour i got a message from him that he has cancelled the party…on the contrary when i called a relative of minea responsible educated person he smartly conveyed that he had booked a flight bto vaishno devi n was planning to go there in a couple of days… i tried to reason out with him but he was reluctant to cancel his trip… thankfully after six hours i forwarded him the news of the closure of the vaishno devi shrineboth would have incurred some financial loss but then the life and safety of self and ones loved ones are more important than some financial damage…its the second kind of thought process that needs to be discouraged… all nonessential travels must be totally stopped…there is another school of thought which saysdont panic…while agree in principle with this attitude i would modify this a bit…i bit of nervousness is a sign of how serious one is about an issue…i remember during my medical college examinations when we would say i am nervous our seniors would suggest that that is good…as that shows you have done preparations…one who is prepared seriously and systematically is a bit nervous… its not life as usual…if people in personal cars would go out for casual drives with there families they would be followed by people in bikes and then the next would be ones using public transport…all have to act responsibly and patiently… also as the prime minister said that this thought that this cant happen to me is further from truth…i again reemphasize on the next 15 days because if we are able to contain the total numbers to less than 1000 in the next fifteen days the spike would into a plateau and it will not unduly put pressure on our health infrastructure…even the government and private combined have limited icus ventilators advanced care setups even in the best of cities… the population of the elderly too is not very insignificant… some state governments have acted promptly and professionally than the others…the government of maharastra uttarakhand and delhi have been quick enough in realising the problem and responding effectively…while other states too must have acted but we need to show a more determined and resolute approach…now last and the most important the morale and the resolve of all the health care workers doctors nurses other staff have to be kept high and their spirits sustained… we can do this by providing them with all the logistic support they need for taking care of covid19 positive patients…the n95 face mask the personal protective equipment ppe goggles gloves etc should be in abundant supply…the supply chain of these are very vital to keep the motivation levels of all the people who are risking there lives and dealing with such highrisk groups be it the police in there usual duties or the airlines staff customs immigration etc at the airports…as i was discussing this issue with a batchmate of mine who is a consultant in mumbai conveyed that there were concerns of a shortage of n95 masks…more than the shortage there is also a tendency to hoard the essential item and then sell them with extremes margin of profit…such unethical profiteerings must be sternly discouraged in this our of crisis…no battle or war can be won if we cannot provide an uninterrupted supply of equipment etc to our soldiersand as i conclude another news flash that a bollywood singer back from london just 10 days back joined parties attended by high profile guests have tested positive for covid19 this approach in itself speaks for the kind of responsibility we exhibit collectively as citizens at the time of an unprecedented national health emergency to end on a positive note china for the second consecutive day has reported nil corona case a ray of hope a silver lining in the dark clouds with a very firm belief that this too shall pass                                                                                                                                                  ,preparing pen thoughts corona saw big bang announcement

Within this six months several historic and transformative decisions have been taken by Modi 2.0 touching positively, in particular, the lives of poor, downtrodden, farmers, women, youth, middle class, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes.

The overarching principle and spirit of all decisions by the Modi government has been “India First”. In line with the mandate and faith re-imposed emphatically by the people of India, the government under Modi’s dynamic leadership has engaged in realising and fulfilling the promises made by the BJP in its election manifesto.
With the larger vision of “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas”, Modi 2.0 is steadfastly working and seeking “Sabka Vishwas”.
Several core promises of the BJP have already been fulfilled. One Nation, One Flag, One Constitution became a reality under the Modi government.
It was a historic moment when the bill to abrogate Article 370, piloted by BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah, was passed by Parliament. The passage of the triple talaq bill has delivered gender justice to Muslim women.
The six months’ tenure of Modi 2.0 in the country also saw the historic verdict of the Supreme Court on Ayodhya, paving the way for the construction of a magnificent Ram temple on “Ram Janmabhoomi”.
Significantly, some of the key political opponents did everything to delay the judgement on Ayodhya. However, as mentioned by Modi in his “Mann Ki Baat” programme, the spirit of peace and harmony that prevailed post-Ayodhya verdict was a testimony to the strength of Indian democracy.
India is on the right path to become a 5 trillion dollar economy soon. With major decisions like strategic disinvestment of PSUs and reforms like tax, labour and banking, the Indian economy is strengthening.
Corporate tax rates have been slashed to 22% for existing and 15% for new domestic manufacturing companies. India now has one of the lowest tax rates, making it one of the most competitive global economies.
Today, the world looks up to India for providing solutions to global issues like climate change and sustainable development and we are no more back benchers.
During the recent Climate Action Summit in New York, the world was taken by surprise when Modi announced that India is going to increase energy produced from non-fossil fuels to 175 GW by 2022, and will further take it to 450 GW. At the same summit the PM also launched a Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.
On the domestic front we have transferred Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds to the tune of Rs 47,436 crore, to 26 states and Union territories for afforestation. We have ensured that tribal rights are protected fully and tribals continue to be  important stakeholders in forest development.
Government is taking all efforts for the mitigation of air pollution in the country. The central government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy with targets to achieve 20% to 30% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024.
The Modi government is determined to take all steps to fight the menace of air pollution and I can assure you that New Delhi will take less time than Beijing to improve its air quality.
Flying clean and high, the Modi government has brought Rafale to India. With this, the litany of false allegations against the government has fallen apart.
Strengthening its outreach to the far-flung areas, the Union government is in the process of setting up of 118 more community radio stations. The Indian Institute of Mass Communication has been tasked with training and capacity building for the same.
In order to enhance the accessibility of television programmes for the hearing impaired, we have asked for the implementation of Accessibility Standard for TV programmes.
Countering fake news has been high on the government’s agenda. We are setting up a fact checking unit in order to identify and effectively counter fake news narratives related to government and its policies.
Modi believes in public participation by which behaviour can be changed. He had proved this through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and building toilets.
Now he has given a clarion call for “Say No to Single Use Plastic”. During just 15 days’ campaign, 13,000 tonnes of plastic waste were collected.
He has also appealed to people to do “plogging”, that is, while jogging or walking, picking and properly disposing of polythene littered on the streets or pathways.
Though six months are a very short period, when we look back, a phenomenal achievement has been made by Modi government 2.0.

10,1617655090-196,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Recall Ram Temple every five years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-editorials/recall-ram-temple-every-five-years/,Recall Ram Temple every five years,"October 19, 2018, 10:52 PM  IST","A rose is a rose is a rose. A temple, however, is a different kettle of matsya avatar. A temple is, variably, a place of spiritual peace and worship, an architectural marvel, an alternative site for solemnising marriage, a mobiliser of immense resources and, occasionally, a tool of political expedience.
This last identity is best exemplified by a temple that does not exist but is constantly on the horizon, the Ram temple allegedly to build which the Babri mosque was razed at Ayodhya in 1992. It is to build this temple that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has asked the government to pass a specific law.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-110963"" src=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-13.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-13.jpg 640w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-13-300x225.jpg 300w, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-13-52x39.jpg 52w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"">
The demand comes at a time when the Supreme Court has cleared the way for hearing the challenge to the Allahabad High Court’s compromise verdict on what essentially is a title suit regarding the piece of real estate on which the mosque stood before it was demolished. Would it be proper for Parliament to move a law on a subject under the court’s express consideration?
Even if a law is initiated now, can it be expected to be passed and notified complete with subordinate legislation any time soon? Why has such a demand not been raised till now, ever since the present government took office in May 2014?
Clearly, the temple demand at this point of time is meant as campaign fodder for the 2019 general elections.
The role of the courts is to settle points of law. The campaign to demolish the mosque at Ayodhya and build a temple there was quintessentially political in character, capitalising on the faith of many that Ram had been born where the mosque stood.
Neither law nor the courts can resolve disputes of politics or faith. If the aim is to find a solution, it should be reached through compromise. If the aim is to whip up religious feeling for electoral gain, hail the temple every five years.

     The US made just 27 constitutional Amendments since 1791 as on 2018, why they are great , why India with over 100 constitutional Amendments since 1951 is just useless.. if we see, our politicians wanted Amendments at the fall  of some hat, do you think they are worth, you might  have noted about 11000   amendments proposals brought in the congress why just 27 is accepted why in India almost in 70 yrs yrs of independence our parliament passed 100  constitutional amendments does it mean indian parliament is simply superb institution in  the world, we need to think is my view sirs....

11,1617655057-189,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The secular fundamentalist,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/headon/the-secular-fundamentalist/,The secular fundamentalist,"June 20, 2013, 2:04 PM  IST","The next general election, says Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, will be a battle between “communal and secular forces.” He’s right. But who represents these two “forces”? And how do you define communalism and secularism? Is Nitish Kumar secular? Is Narendra Modi communal? Has L.K. Advani suddenly morphed from being communal to being secular? Does Sonia Gandhi represent secularism? 
I attempted answers to some of these questions here and here. 
In the final analysis, the 2014 Lok Sabha poll will be a referendum on the ideologies of Sonia Gandhi and Narendra Modi. Sonia’s stewardship of the Congress has demonstrated that she stands for the following: 
1: Secularism;
2: Welfarism;
3: Inclusive growth. 
All are unexceptionable in theory but problematic in practice. Consider each:  
Secularism: The classical definition of secularism is simple: keeping religion out of the public domain. The definition of communalism is equally straightforward: using religion to win votes by offering job, educational or other quotas to, for example, Muslims or pandering, for example, to Hindus over emotive issues like building a Ram temple at Ayodhya. In short, religion is private. Keep it at home.  
The brand of secularism the Congress has practised for decades has been economically and socially detrimental to Muslims. Outcome, not intent, is the only real test of a policy targeted at a specific community. By that test, the secularism of the Congress – and of the JD(U), SP and NCP in their respective states – fails the test.  
Welfarism: India’s fiscal profligacy, since especially 2011, has led to low economic growth, inflation and a falling rupee. Much of this profligacy is predicated on the Congress’s welfarism. This has been opposed by the Prime Minister. But he has often been – unconstitutionally – vetoed by Sonia.  
Inclusive Growth: Economists ranging from Keynes to Friedman have stressed that, without growth, inclusion becomes irrelevant. But inclusive growth is possible only if there is growth. Instead, the UPA’s nine years in office have become better known for inclusive corruption.  
Turn now to the ideology of Sonia’s principal political rival – Narendra Modi. His definition of secularism has been articulated as India First – nation above all else. This stands up to scrutiny – in theory. In practice, the outcome will emerge only in the fullness of time.  
On welfarism, Modi clearly prefers a private sector, industry-driven model. This has worked well in Gujarat though health and social indicators need to catch up with the manufacturing sector before Modi’s economic model can be declared a complete success.  
On inclusive growth, Modi says he works for “six crore Gujaratis, not six crore Hindus and Muslims”. Again, that’s impeccable in theory. In practice, Muslims in Gujarat are indeed better off than Muslims, for example, in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Assam. But inclusiveness is an ongoing project. It needs constant attention and improvement.  
Author Amish Tripathi recently wrote: “The answer to religious extremism is not secular extremism, but religious liberalism. This leads one to the obvious question: what is liberalism? For in modern Indian public debate, the definition of liberalism has been distorted. Being liberal is very often misconstrued as being leftist. But I have met many leftists who are as illiberal as the right-wing extremists they oppose. We have to realize that religious extremism will only be defeated by religious liberalism, not by ivory-tower, secular, homilies from our elite.” (Emphasis added).  
Digvijaya Singh, as I said at the start, is right in declaring 2014 a contest between secular and communal forces. But his party has too often preached the former and practised the latter. 
In less than 10 months, a young, aspirational Indian electorate, interested in corruption-free, decisive governance and jobs, not religious extremism or dressed-up secularism, will deliver a verdict.  
If that verdict places real secularism, and not the fraudulent variety manufactured by some parties, at the heart of Indian society, religion will no longer be held hostage to political opportunists.

is equally straightforward using religion to win votes by offering job educational or other quotas to for example muslims or pandering for example to hindus over emotive issues like building a ram

constant attention and improvement  author amish tripathi recently wrote the answer to religious extremism is not secular extremism but religious liberalism this leads one to the obvious question what is liberalism for in modern indian public debate the definition of liberalism has been distorted being liberal is very often misconstrued as being leftist but i have met many leftists who are as

added  digvijaya singh as i said at the start is right in declaring 2014 a contest between secular and communal forces but his party has too often preached the former and practised the latter in less than 10 months a young aspirational indian electorate interested in corruptionfree decisive governance and jobs not religious extremism or dressedup secularism will deliver a verdict  if that verdict

12,1617655454-284,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ayodhya Verdict: The Future Of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Introspection/ayodhya-verdict-the-future-of-india/,Ayodhya Verdict: The Future Of India,"October 11, 2010, 8:44 PM  IST","""Does the Almighty need a place fixed by human beings to live?"" This, I believe, would have been Gandhi’s reply had he been alive, for a solution to the vexed Babri mosque-Ramjanambhoomi dispute in Ayodhya. He would have said ""The dispute will be resolved effortlessly if Hindus lay their lives seeking justice for 2002 Gujrat genocide victims and Muslims offer their heads to restore rights of the Kashmiri Pandits, victims of ethnic cleansing.""
 
Many may call it impractical but Bapu sucessfully used the formula ""instead of fighting against each other, Hindus and Muslims must fight for each other” for Hindu-Muslim unity in 1921 when he launched the campaign to mobilise people for the non-cooperation movement. He visited every nook and corner of India exhorting Hindus to put their weight behind the Muslims’ Khilafat movement and asked Muslims to stop cow slaughter to respect Hindu sentiments.
 
The task initiated by the Father of the Nation has become more relevant today. A reflection of it can be seen in the verdict of the Allahabad high court on the Ayodhya dispute. The post-verdict maturity shown by the Hindus and the Muslims so far is commendable, although there is an element of disappointment among a section of Muslims. As expected, political parties and hardliners are out to polarise the people by misinterpreting the verdict to serve their vested interests.
 
Though legal questions are being raised over the verdict, I would particularly like to salute Justice US Khan. He placed legal facts before us and also suggested the solution. He asked Indian Muslims to show the world the real meaning of Islam by resolving the Ayodhya conflict. He cited examples of Lord Ram and Prophet Mohammad to explain what sacrifice and reconciliation means and how it can pave the way for better relations between Hindus and Muslims.
 
Justice Khan observed: ""When Prophet Mohammad entered into a treaty with the rival group at Hudayliyah, it appeared to be abject surrender even to his staunch supporters. However, the Quran described that as a clear victory and it did prove so. Within a short span therefrom the Muslims entered Mecca as victors and not a drop of blood was shed… Indian Muslims have inherited a huge legacy of religious learning and knowledge… It’s time to show it to the world.""
 
Justice Khan said what he believed to be true. It needs real courage to speak the truth fully knowing that it might also earn brickbats. He, I believe, has suggested that the distrust between the Hindus and the Muslims, which came after Independence, should go and asked Muslims to take the initiative. In the same spirit, the plaintiff in the Ayodhya case, Muhammad Hashim Ansari  requested the mahant of Hanuman Garhi to work for an out-of-court settlement.
 
Now it’s the turn of Hindus to reciprocate with equal generosity and display the true spirit of Hinduism by offering to build the mosque at the place where it stood before being demolished by Hindu fanatics. It will be the triumph of Hinduism and not a loss. Hindu pseudo-nationalist talk about Babri mosque built after the demolition of Ram temple but never mention that Hanuman Garhi in Ayodhya has been built on the land donated by the Muslim nawabs of Awadh.
 
What Justice Khan did was (in Gandhi’s words) a satyagrah, that is, a firm assertion of truth. This will help the country to counter terrorism being carried out in the name of Hindutava and Islam. The most important element in any court verdict is justice and Justice Khan has delivered it to millions of Hindus and Muslims of India and to the coming generations who may not be a party to the case but are affected by it and they don’t want bloodshed over the issue anymore.
 
The challenge was no less for Bapu in 1921 to convince people that Hindus and Muslims can be brothers and that the non-violent struggle requires more determination, courage and sacrifice. Gandhi’s formula was also of sacrifice and reconciliation by both Hindus and Muslims. Despite opposition by some prominent leaders, he was successful in building a formidable alliance of Hindus and Muslims and made the weakest of the weak stand up against the mighty British Empire.
 
The non-cooperation movement was launched after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Punjab, where on April 13, 1919, over 1,200 people, protesting peacefully against the suppressive Rowlatt Act, were killed in a firing ordered by General Dyre. At that time, the British action against the caliph of Turkey angered Muslims, who launched the Khilafat movement. Gandhi, with the support of Ali brothers and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, brought Hindus and Muslims together.
 
According to Pascal Alan Nazareth, managing trustee, Sarvodaya International Trust, Gandhi also supported  Shaukat Ali’s proposal that there should be three national slogans – ""Allaho Akbar"" (God is great), Vande Mataram( Hail, Motherland) and Hindu-Mussalman ki Jai (victory to Hindus and Muslims). He urged people to enthusiastically raise the third slogan since India could not be conceived without the union of Hindu and Muslim hearts.
 
However, Gandhi withdrew the movement when it was at its peak in February 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident in which 23 policemen were killed by an agitating mob. He was criticised by Muslim and Hindu leaders for withdrawing the movement at a crucial time. But Gandhi derived his strength from the masses who identified themselves with his way of life. No wonder lakhs followed when he undertook the Dandi march in 1930 to launch the civil disobedience movement.
 
The movement was suspended in 1931 after the Gandhi-Irwin pact with the British accepting some demands. But Gandhi was slammed by Hindu and communist leaders for not negotiating the death sentences of revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. Protests also took place against Gandhi at many places. But in 1932, the nation looked up to Bapu again when the British tried to divide Hindus through separate electorate for dalits as they did to break Hindu-Muslim unity.
 
Gandhi undertook a fast unto death to oppose separate electorate which led to signing of the Poona Pact, which replaced the separate electorate with a system of reserved constituencies for the dalits. He also launched a campaign against untouchability, the ancient evil practised by Hindus. But the Poona Pact made him a villain for dalit leaders, who blame him even today for ""sabotaging the dalit cause"", and reforms carried out by Bapu made him an eyesore of saffron outfits.
 
Gandhi also had to face criticism within in the Congress. In 1934, he resigned from the party’s primary membership to focus on social reforms. But masses rallied behind in the 1942 Quit India movement. Independence in 1947 was marred by gory riots. While India celebrated freedom, Gandhi was on fast unto death in Calcutta to stop riots. Over 55,000 soldiers deployed in Punjab could not stop the killings. A lone Bapu brought communal madness under control in Bengal.
 
In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a terrorist brainwashed by the Hindu extremist organisations. Hindu pseudo-nationalist plotted the assassination of Gandhi as they knew that their narrow and radical Hinduism will never by able to ideologically defeat Bapu’s Hinduism (practised by majority Hindus) based on non-violence, tolerance, truth and sacrifice. The world took inspiration from the Mahatma but in his own country a hate campaign against Gandhi continue. The Ayodhya verdict is being criticised by many but I see it as an attempt to follow the path of reconciliation and peace showed by the Father of the Nation.
 
It’s true that Muslim invaders plundered thousands of temples and looted wealth but could not break India’s spirit. But that was 500-1000 years ago. The invaders were outsiders and the Muslims today in the country are sons of the soil who rejected the two-nation theory of MA Jinnah and preferred India over Pakistan. These Muslims helped us become a nuclear power (former president APJ Abdul Kalam) and win wars (Paramveer Abdul Hamid) against Pakistan.
 
It’s true that communal elements, separatists and terrorists are also among Muslims. Kashmir is bleeding because of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Hindus have been persecuted in neighbouring Islamic countries. Jihadi terrorism is threatening world peace. Muslim youths are being brainwashed by Islamist  extremist outfits. But it’s also true that the same terrorist ideology is killing innocent Muslims in Islamic countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
In India, both sides have opportunist and misguided people. If Hindus have Togadias, Muslims have Bukharis. If Hindu extremists are responsible for 1989, 1992 and 2002 riots, Muslim extremist used these riots to brainwash Muslim youths for terror attacks. If Muslims have Students’ Islamic Movement of India, Hindus have Abhinav Bharat. Hindus have been caught spying for Pakistan. Muslims are not responsible for Naxalism and caste killings.
 
But at the same time, 90% of Hindus and Muslims want peace. The two communities are intricately weaved into the national fabric. Attempts to separate them would mean destruction. Can we do away with the tabla and the sitar, carved out from mridang and veena respectively by Amir Khusrau? Can we imagine Indian cinema without Dilip Kumar and music without Bismillah Khan? Can we forget the successful chase of England’s 326 score by Yuvraj and Kaif in 2002?
 
Kabir, Nanak and Raidas cannot be divided. More Hindus visit Sufi shrines than Muslims. In Ayodhya, many Muslims earn their living by stitching clothes for Lord Ram and by selling flowers for puja. Examples of a temple and a mosque situated adjacent to each other and Hindus and Muslims living peacefully are in abundance. Those who are dividing people on communal lines now to serve their interests, if successful, will divide us later on regional lines (is Marathi Manus listening?).
In my opinion (and I am sure most would agree), Swami Vivekanand knew more about Hinduism than the Thackerays, Advanis and Bhagwats. Vivekanand took pride in the fact that he belonged to a nation which gave shelter to the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations on earth. At the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, he said: ""I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.""
In ""Future of India"", Vivekanand stated: ""The Mohammedan conquest of India came as a salvation to the down-trodden, to the poor. That is why one-fifth of our people have become Mohammedans. It was not the sword that did it all. It would be the height of madness to think that it was all the work of sword and fire."" He believed that the future of India needs Hinduism with its qualities of inclusiveness and tolerance but sans caste discrimination and communal hatred.
The revolutionary Bhagat Singh was an atheist and staunch supporter of Hindu-Muslim unity. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s right hand in the Indian National Army was Major General Shah Nawaz Khan, who along with Colonel Prem Sahgal (Hindu) and Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon (Sikh) refused to be defended by MA Jinnah, the architect of partition, after their arrest in 1945. Jinnah had offered his services as a lawyer to Khan if he joins Muslim League.
The legendary Ram Prasad Bismil, who penned ""Sarfaroshi ki tammana"", was a staunch Brahmin and his best friend was Ashfaqulla Khan, a devout Muslim. Both preferred to kiss the noose of the hangman over a mercy petition in 1927. Bismil has written in his autobiography that he and his compatriots may have failed in getting their motherland free from the British but were able to prove that Hindus and Muslims can fight together like brothers against the British rule. The same spirit is need today.

     Gandhiji deceived nationwhen he accepted the division of country for creation of Pakistan forgetting his previous promise that division of motherland could follow after the division of his body only,never before his eyes.Being follower of nonviolence how could he permitted Indian Govt. to send army to defend Kashmir when attacked by Pakistanee Marauders in October  1947 ?Thirdly,Gandhiji never announced Fast unto deathagainst enemy or opponentsuch as Britishers or Jeena.Had he dared to announce the fast against creation of Pakistan he would have met the same fate as that of Swami Shraddhanand who participated in the Khilapat movement shoulder to shoulder with Muslims who assasinated him when he presided over reconversions back to Hinduism for the Muslims who wanted to come back to Hinduism....

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",does the almighty need a place fixed by human beings to live this i believe would have been gandhis reply had he been alive for a solution to the vexed babri mosqueramjanambhoomi dispute in ayodhya he would have said the dispute will be resolved effortlessly if hindus lay their lives seeking justice for 2002 gujrat genocide victims and muslims offer their heads to restore rights of the kashmiri pandits victims of ethnic cleansing many may call it impractical but bapu sucessfully used the formula instead of fighting against each other hindus and muslims must fight for each other for hindumuslim unity in 1921 when he launched the campaign to mobilise people for the noncooperation movement he visited every nook and corner of india exhorting hindus to put their weight behind the muslims khilafat movement and asked muslims to stop cow slaughter to respect hindu sentiments the task initiated by the father of the nation has become more relevant today a reflection of it can be seen in the verdict of the allahabad high court on the ayodhya dispute the postverdict maturity shown by the hindus and the muslims so far is commendable although there is an element of disappointment among a section of muslims as expected political parties and hardliners are out to polarise the people by misinterpreting the verdict to serve their vested interests though legal questions are being raised over the verdict i would particularly like to salute justice us khan he placed legal facts before us and also suggested the solution he asked indian muslims to show the world the real meaning of islam by resolving the ayodhya conflict he cited examples of lord ram and prophet mohammad to explain what sacrifice and reconciliation means and how it can pave the way for better relations between hindus and muslims justice khan observed when prophet mohammad entered into a treaty with the rival group at hudayliyah it appeared to be abject surrender even to his staunch supporters however the quran described that as a clear victory and it did prove so within a short span therefrom the muslims entered mecca as victors and not a drop of blood was shed… indian muslims have inherited a huge legacy of religious learning and knowledge… its time to show it to the world justice khan said what he believed to be true it needs real courage to speak the truth fully knowing that it might also earn brickbats he i believe has suggested that the distrust between the hindus and the muslims which came after independence should go and asked muslims to take the initiative in the same spirit the plaintiff in the ayodhya case muhammad hashim ansari  requested the mahant of hanuman garhi to work for an outofcourt settlement now its the turn of hindus to reciprocate with equal generosity and display the true spirit of hinduism by offering to build the mosque at the place where it stood before being demolished by hindu fanatics it will be the triumph of hinduism and not a loss hindu pseudonationalist talk about babri mosque built after the demolition of ram temple but never mention that hanuman garhi in ayodhya has been built on the land donated by the muslim nawabs of awadh what justice khan did was in gandhis words a satyagrah that is a firm assertion of truth this will help the country to counter terrorism being carried out in the name of hindutava and islam the most important element in any court verdict is justice and justice khan has delivered it to millions of hindus and muslims of india and to the coming generations who may not be a party to the case but are affected by it and they dont want bloodshed over the issue anymore the challenge was no less for bapu in 1921 to convince people that hindus and muslims can be brothers and that the nonviolent struggle requires more determination courage and sacrifice gandhis formula was also of sacrifice and reconciliation by both hindus and muslims despite opposition by some prominent leaders he was successful in building a formidable alliance of hindus and muslims and made the weakest of the weak stand up against the mighty british empire the noncooperation movement was launched after the jallianwala bagh massacre in punjab where on april 13 1919 over 1200 people protesting peacefully against the suppressive rowlatt act were killed in a firing ordered by general dyre at that time the british action against the caliph of turkey angered muslims who launched the khilafat movement gandhi with the support of ali brothers and maulana abul kalam azad brought hindus and muslims together according to pascal alan nazareth managing trustee sarvodaya international trust gandhi also supported  shaukat alis proposal that there should be three national slogans – allaho akbar god is great vande mataram hail motherland and hindumussalman ki jai victory to hindus and muslims he urged people to enthusiastically raise the third slogan since india could not be conceived without the union of hindu and muslim hearts however gandhi withdrew the movement when it was at its peak in february 1922 after the chauri chaura incident in which 23 policemen were killed by an agitating mob he was criticised by muslim and hindu leaders for withdrawing the movement at a crucial time but gandhi derived his strength from the masses who identified themselves with his way of life no wonder lakhs followed when he undertook the dandi march in 1930 to launch the civil disobedience movement the movement was suspended in 1931 after the gandhiirwin pact with the british accepting some demands but gandhi was slammed by hindu and communist leaders for not negotiating the death sentences of revolutionaries bhagat singh sukhdev and rajguru protests also took place against gandhi at many places but in 1932 the nation looked up to bapu again when the british tried to divide hindus through separate electorate for dalits as they did to break hindumuslim unity gandhi undertook a fast unto death to oppose separate electorate which led to signing of the poona pact which replaced the separate electorate with a system of reserved constituencies for the dalits he also launched a campaign against untouchability the ancient evil practised by hindus but the poona pact made him a villain for dalit leaders who blame him even today for sabotaging the dalit cause and reforms carried out by bapu made him an eyesore of saffron outfits gandhi also had to face criticism within in the congress in 1934 he resigned from the partys primary membership to focus on social reforms but masses rallied behind in the 1942 quit india movement independence in 1947 was marred by gory riots while india celebrated freedom gandhi was on fast unto death in calcutta to stop riots over 55000 soldiers deployed in punjab could not stop the killings a lone bapu brought communal madness under control in bengal in 1948 gandhi was assassinated by a terrorist brainwashed by the hindu extremist organisations hindu pseudonationalist plotted the assassination of gandhi as they knew that their narrow and radical hinduism will never by able to ideologically defeat bapus hinduism practised by majority hindus based on nonviolence tolerance truth and sacrifice the world took inspiration from the mahatma but in his own country a hate campaign against gandhi continue the ayodhya verdict is being criticised by many but i see it as an attempt to follow the path of reconciliation and peace showed by the father of the nation its true that muslim invaders plundered thousands of temples and looted wealth but could not break indias spirit but that was 5001000 years ago the invaders were outsiders and the muslims today in the country are sons of the soil who rejected the twonation theory of ma jinnah and preferred india over pakistan these muslims helped us become a nuclear power former president apj abdul kalam and win wars paramveer abdul hamid against pakistan its true that communal elements separatists and terrorists are also among muslims kashmir is bleeding because of pakistansponsored terrorism hindus have been persecuted in neighbouring islamic countries jihadi terrorism is threatening world peace muslim youths are being brainwashed by islamist  extremist outfits but its also true that the same terrorist ideology is killing innocent muslims in islamic countries like pakistan bangladesh iraq and afghanistan in india both sides have opportunist and misguided people if hindus have togadias muslims have bukharis if hindu extremists are responsible for 1989 1992 and 2002 riots muslim extremist used these riots to brainwash muslim youths for terror attacks if muslims have students islamic movement of india hindus have abhinav bharat hindus have been caught spying for pakistan muslims are not responsible for naxalism and caste killings but at the same time 90 of hindus and muslims want peace the two communities are intricately weaved into the national fabric attempts to separate them would mean destruction can we do away with the tabla and the sitar carved out from mridang and veena respectively by amir khusrau can we imagine indian cinema without dilip kumar and music without bismillah khan can we forget the successful chase of englands 326 score by yuvraj and kaif in 2002 kabir nanak and raidas cannot be divided more hindus visit sufi shrines than muslims in ayodhya many muslims earn their living by stitching clothes for lord ram and by selling flowers for puja examples of a temple and a mosque situated adjacent to each other and hindus and muslims living peacefully are in abundance those who are dividing people on communal lines now to serve their interests if successful will divide us later on regional lines is marathi manus listeningin my opinion and i am sure most would agree swami vivekanand knew more about hinduism than the thackerays advanis and bhagwats vivekanand took

Hugo Black J. and William O Douglas J, majority opinion in New York Times Co. v. United States June 30, 1971.
Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India. Author of `Choosing Hammurabi: Debates on Judicial Appointments’ (LexisNexis) and `Appointing our Judges: Forging Independence and Accountability’ (LexisNexis)
Implicit in the actions the establishment uses to muzzle the press, is the silent and persuasive rhetoric which is implemented through the constabulary. With the judiciary’s languid response, “we will not interfere with the investigation”, terror is embedded onto the ecosystem of free speech. The technique is age old. And the response is as ancient as ‘Pontius Pilate’ washing his hands off in the most celebrated murder.
THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE WIRE

Sidharth Varadarajan had written an article on his twitter account attributing the comment, that ‘Lord Ram would protect devotees from the coronavirus’, to the UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The next day, he posted a correction noting that the statement had been made not by the CM of UP, but by Acharya Paramhans, the head of the Ayodhya temple trust. Commonsensically, and even in conservative legalese, the matter ought to have rested there. But this correction does not prevent a FIR to be instituted by a stranger to the controversy in Ayodhya 650 kms away from where S.Varadarajan lives.
The notice was carried by the UP Police personnel which demanded his appearance on 14 April. There is a countrywide lock down. Intimidation of the free press is writ large in the manner and methodology deployed by the police machinery.
WHY REPEATED ATTACKS ON FREE PRESS TAKE PLACE?

But why does this brazen attack at all take place against the press in the broad daylight of a free constitution. It serves a dual purpose for the political establishment. Firstly, It acts as exemplary intimidation of one, and expects the terror will ensure silence of the multitude. Also, it acts as a barometer to test the response of the courts to its brazenness. The eminent American journalist H.L.Mencken noted as early as 1950, “Their usual plan is to invade the constitution stealthily, and then wait to see what happens. If nothing happens they go on more boldly.”
THE CHILLING CHRONOLOGY OF JUDICIAL RESPONSE

There is a chilling chronology of cases of the Supreme Court of India in the recent years when it came to the liberties of men and women. First of the cases was when Kanhaiya Kumar was brought into the Patiala House Courts on charges of sedition and assaulted on the court premises. The court appointed a committee of Mr.Kapil Sibal,Sr.Adv., Dr.Rajeev Dhawan,Sr.Adv., Mr. Dushyant Dave, Sr.Adv., Mr. H.P. Rawal, Sr.Adv., Mr. Ajit K. Sinha, Sr. Adv. and Mr. A.D.N. Rao, learned counsel to proceed to the Patiala House Courts Complex and report the situation prevailing there. The lawyer’s committee filed a report about the violent incidents of 17th February. The report is a chilling account of what these senior lawyers witnessed first hand of the complete breakdown of the rule of law unparalleled in Independent India. They gave a graphic description of how lawyers and journalists were locked inside the court room and Kanhaiya Kumar was badly beaten up by lawyers, while police did nothing to prevent it. The Supreme Court followed the conventional path of letting the trial court decide his bail nevertheless. In an unusual and unprecedented situation like this, instead of assuming jurisdiction and hearing his bail, Kanhaiya was sent him back to the courts where lumpens not only endangered his life but allowed an atmosphere of fear to permeate to the justice administration system. Later Supreme Court dismissed a plea for a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe on the basis of the report of the senior lawyers on the attacks on him at the Patiala House Courts complex in February 2016. Rejecting the prayer, a Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi said “We don’t want to flog a dead horse back into life”
Second, was the incarceration of some of the most brilliant minds in this country: Sudhir Dhawale, a Mumbai-based Dalit rights activist; Surendra Gadling is a lawyer; Mahesh Raut, who works on displacement issues; Shoma Sen, a retired university professor; Rona Wilson, a Delhi-based prisoners’ rights activist; Arun Ferreira is a rights advocate; Sudha Bharadwaj is a Harvard decorated lawyer; writer Varavara Rao is an eminent poet, literary critic and journalist; and Vernon Gonsalves is an academic. The judgement dealing with their liberties in Romila Thapar v. Union of India delivered by the majority could not come up with a response for the liberty of these eminent men and women. The dissenting judgement laid the roadmap to rein in the malaise of a vindictive criminal administration system. But a dissent is a lodestar.
Third, was the nightmarish situation faced by the lawyers of the Senior Counsel, P.Chidambaram. His lawyers moved from court to court running for listing for hearing of his bail. Attempts to get the bail listed before the courts ended up a cropper, resulting in his arrest, a prolonged incarceration and subsequent bail granted by a reasoned judgment of Justice R.Banumati and Justice A.S.Bopanna.
Fourth, was the refusal to grant anticipatory bail to the eminent Dalit scholar Anand Telmude and Gautam Navlakha, a noted civil rights activist and consulting editor of the Economic and Political Weekly by the Supreme Court. Romilla Thapar and other’s appeal to “restore public confidence in our constitution and the civil liberties that it guarantees to all citizens” was just, by now, howling against the wind.
Each of these cases in the chronology is a bolder and bolder attempt at testing the judicial will. Sadly it is also an indicator of how far the courts have travelled from the jealous protection of human liberties.
It was eerily ironic that Anand Telmude, grand son-in-law of Dr B.R.Ambedkar surrendered and was arrested on the 129th birth anniversary of the father of our constitution. It is interesting to note what Ambedkar had to say about the his vocal opponents and critics within the Constituent Assembly viz. Kamath, Dr. P.S. Deshmukh, Sidhva, Prof. Saxena, Pandit Thakur, Das Bhargava, Prof. K.T Shah and Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru.
“That I was not prepared to accept their suggestions does not diminish the value of their suggestions nor lessen the service they have rendered to the Assembly in enlivening its proceedings. I am grateful to them. But for them, I would not have had the opportunity which I got for expounding the principles underlying the Constitution which was more important than the mere mechanical work of passing the Constitution.”
When these instances of judicial indifference is alluded to, there is always the smug question, “was it possible for the Supreme Court to intervene in favour of liberties?” Loaded in the response is that our judiciary cannot go beyond the Lakshman Rekha of the an ancient and timid Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. The answer to the question is an undoubted ‘yes’. But the irony is that even Supreme Courts from the most conservative Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions have spectacularly come to the rescue of democracies.
SRI LANKAN SUPREME COURT PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTION

Two instances come to the fore. First, the intervention of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court when President Maithripala Sirisena of Sri Lanka dismissed the Parliament before the constitutionally mandated tenure came to an end. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court eloquently put it that the sovereignty of the people was the ‘grundnorm’ of the Constitution, the Fundamental rights were “part of their intangible heritage” and the Court was “giving tangible and effective life and meaning to the sovereignty of the people”.
U.K. SUPREME COURT TO THE RESCUE

Similarly in September 2019, 11 judges of the Supreme Court of United Kingdom, unanimously delivered a verdict reversing the decision of the Prime Minister Boris Johnson to prorogue the Parliament. Despite the fact that the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution, from the 17thcentury, the English courts have protected parliamentary sovereignty and the threats posed to it by the use of prerogative powers. Even the ingenious argument that the Prime Minister’s accountability to Parliament was a sufficient safeguard and therefore courts, should not intervene was thwarted. The court concluded that the “fact that the minister is politically accountable to Parliament does not mean that he is therefore immune from legal accountability to the courts.”
CASE AGAINST PRASHANT BHUSHAN

Before the ink dries on this article, Prashant Bhushan’s tweet has invited a notice to be served on him from Rajkot which is 1100 kms away from Delhi. Weaponizing prosecution against the exercise of free speech is eroding the foundations of democratic discourse. It was Harry S. Truman who, incidentally, addressing on the Internal Security of the United States on August 8, 1950 said “Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.” . It reads as if he is writing for today’s time and age.
Justice Deepak Gupta in his remarkable speech on democracy and dissent so effectively conveyed the raison d’etre of the constitution when he simply read the preamble and pithily demonstrated “WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved ……. to secure to all its citizens: .. LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief…..” When did this constitutional promise evaporate or get diluted?
INDIAN COURTS AT THE CROSSROADS OF HISTORY

Free speech is ever more important as we are in the midst of a hitherto unfathomable and uncharted pandemic. The pandemic has hit the shores of five continents. Information, scientific studies, statistical data is being relayed at the speed of light across jurisdictions. A case in point is the war on HIV/AIDS which was won with the concerted efforts of scientists, doctors, politicians, journalists, civil society and social workers. Journalists and rebel pharmaceutical companies like CIPLA who successfully waged a war to bring down the extortionate cost of retroviral drugs. It is a relentless exchange of information, be it scientific data, ground level human conditions, information on responses to drugs, information on the availability of hospital spaces, medical equipment, medicines, the nutritional condition of the poor and impoverished. The list of information being exchanged is endless.
It is appropriate in these trying and vexed times to invoke the eminent Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, who had empirically demonstrated that ”No famine has ever taken place in the history of the world in a functioning democracy,”. Sen explained that democratic governments ”have to win elections and face public criticism, and have strong incentive to undertake measures to avert famines and other catastrophes. There has not been a large-scale loss of life since 1947.”
Higher judiciary in India is at the crossroads of our constitutional history. There are two paths before it. To sustain a constitution responsive to the liberties granted by the founders or endorse an untenable interpretation of the constitution indifferent to human liberties. To quote Justice Deepak Gupta again, “The superior courts as protectors of the rights of the people have a duty to ensure that the powers that be do not suppress dissent because that will have, to use the words of brother Justice Nariman a ‘chilling effect’ on the freedom of speech”
The FIR on Sidharth Varadarajan is an assault on the freedom of press in India. It has consequences far beyond the FIR. The gauntlet has been thrown down once again at the judiciary. This time what is at stake is not just the freedom of the press, but democracy itself.

manner and methodology deployed by the police machinerywhy repeated attacks on free press take placebut why does this brazen attack at all take place against the press in the broad daylight of a free constitution it serves a dual purpose for the political establishment firstly it acts as exemplary intimidation of one and expects the terror will ensure silence of the multitude also it acts as a barometer to test the response of the courts to its brazenness the eminent american journalist hlmencken noted as early as 1950 their usual plan is to invade the constitution stealthily and then wait to see what happens if nothing happens they go on more boldlythe chilling chronology of judicial responsethere is a chilling chronology of cases of the supreme court of india in the recent years when it came to the liberties of men and women first of the cases was when kanhaiya kumar was brought into the patiala house courts on charges of sedition and assaulted on the court premises the court appointed a committee of mrkapil sibalsradv drrajeev dhawansradv mr dushyant dave sradv mr hp rawal sradv mr ajit k sinha sr adv and mr adn rao learned counsel to proceed to the patiala house courts complex and report the situation prevailing there the lawyers committee filed a report about the violent incidents of 17th february the report is a chilling account of what these senior lawyers witnessed first hand of the complete breakdown of the rule of law unparalleled in independent india they gave a graphic description of how lawyers and journalists were locked inside the court room and kanhaiya kumar was badly beaten up by lawyers while police did nothing to prevent it the supreme court followed the conventional path of letting the trial court decide his bail nevertheless in an unusual and unprecedented situation like this instead of assuming jurisdiction and hearing his bail kanhaiya was sent him back to the courts where lumpens not only endangered his life but allowed an atmosphere of fear to permeate to the justice administration system later supreme court dismissed a plea for a special investigation team sit probe on the basis of the report of the senior lawyers on the attacks on him at the patiala house courts complex in february 2016 rejecting the prayer a bench led by justice ranjan gogoi said we dont want to flog a dead horse back into lifesecond was the

response for the liberty of these eminent men and women the dissenting judgement laid the roadmap to rein in the malaise of a vindictive criminal administration system but a dissent is a lodestarthird was the nightmarish situation faced by the lawyers of the senior counsel pchidambaram his lawyers moved from court to court running for listing for hearing of his bail attempts to get the bail listed before the courts ended up a cropper resulting in his arrest a prolonged incarceration and subsequent bail granted by a reasoned judgment of justice rbanumati and justice asbopannafourth was the refusal to grant anticipatory bail to the eminent dalit scholar anand telmude and gautam navlakha a noted civil rights activist and consulting editor of the economic and political weekly by the supreme court romilla thapar and others appeal to restore public confidence in our constitution and the civil liberties that it guarantees to all citizens was just by now howling against the windeach of these cases in the chronology is a bolder and bolder attempt at testing the judicial will sadly it is also an indicator of how far the courts have travelled from the jealous protection of human libertiesit was eerily ironic that anand telmude grand soninlaw of dr brambedkar surrendered and was arrested on the 129th birth anniversary of the father of our constitution it is interesting to note what ambedkar had to say about the his vocal opponents and critics within the constituent assembly viz kamath dr ps deshmukh sidhva prof saxena pandit thakur das bhargava prof kt shah and pandit hirday nath kunzruthat i was not prepared to accept their suggestions does not diminish the value of their suggestions nor lessen the service they have rendered to the assembly in enlivening its

mechanical work of passing the constitutionwhen these instances of judicial indifference is alluded to there is always the smug question was it possible for the supreme court to intervene in favour of liberties loaded in the response is that our judiciary cannot go beyond the lakshman rekha of the an ancient and timid anglosaxon jurisprudence the answer to the question is an undoubted yes but the

14,1617655364-263,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Supreme Court must clarify when it says Ayodhya hearing put off due to non-availability of judge,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/andwordsisallihave/supreme-court-must-clarify-when-it-says-ayodhya-hearing-put-off-due-to-non-availability-of-judge/,Supreme Court must clarify when it says Ayodhya hearing put off due to non-availability of judge,"January 27, 2019, 10:42 PM  IST","Surely, there cannot be anything more important than a five-judge Constitution bench hearing on the Ayodhya issue where the Chief Justice of India would have consulted the other four judges before fixing January 29, 2019, as the date for the first hearing.
It does, therefore, seem rather bizarre for the Supreme Court additional registrar to issue a circular on January 27 saying that the January 29 hearing has been postponed because of the “non-availability” of Justice Bobde. The notice issued by the additional registrar almost makes it sound as if Justice Bobde has some other appointment on January 29 and is, therefore, not available. What could be more important than a Constitution Bench hearing?
If, however, Justice Bobde has suddenly fallen sick, then the Supreme Court additional registrar should say so. Judges in their sixties are as prone to fall sick as all of us, especially in the world’s most polluted city of Delhi where the very air people breathe contains all kinds of dangerous pollutants. Or so we have been told, ad nauseum, ad infinitum.
For the Supreme Court additional registrar to, therefore, just put out a bland notice saying the hearing on Ayodhya has been postponed because of the non-availability of Justice Bobde does seem cursory and casual to the point of being curt, especially considering that a Constitution Bench has been set up for this purpose and that the last judgment on the Ayodhya issue was delivered more than eight years ago on September 30, 2010, by the Allahabad High Court (which decreed that the immediate area under the central dome of the demolished Babri Masjid was the birth-place of Lord Ram and that the surrounding land be divided into three parts, two-thirds going to the deity and the Nirmohi Akhara, and one-third going to the Sunni Central Wakf Board). The judgment was stayed by the Supreme Court in 2011.
The latest notice put out by the Supreme Court additional-registrar does not even mention when the postponed January 29 five-judge Constitution hearing will take place. While the question of judicial reforms has been agitating the minds of all members of the legal fraternity, at the very outset there should be far greater clarity on the notices issued by the registrar on the postponement of something as important as a hearing by a Constitution Bench.
One understands that India’s judges, especially those in the Supreme Court, are heavily burdened and have a very tight schedule. However, once an appeal is made against a judgment delivered on September 30, 2010, by a High Court and the matter is stayed in 2011 by the Supreme Court, it cannot be kept in indefinite limbo, to say the obvious least.
Eight years after the Allahabad High Court judgment, a five-judge Constitution Bench has been set up but its very first hearing (to presumably decide, among other things, the scheduling of the case) has been postponed because of what the additional-registrar says is the “non-availability” of one of the judges.
If the Supreme Court is of the view that the Ayodhya issue should be sorted out through dialogue between the parties involved, it should say so. However, once the matter is taken up for hearing, it should be heard expeditiously, considering that eight years have already elapsed since the Allahabad High Court judgment.
What seems to be forgotten in all this is that India’s High Courts also have a crucial role to play in the delivery of justice. Take the horrendous Nirbhaya case where a 23-year-old physiotherapist died due to severe injuries sustained during a brutal gang-rape in a moving Delhi bus on the night of December 16, 2012. A lower fast-track court sentenced the four gang-rapists to death on September 13, 2013, and the capital punishment was confirmed by the Delhi High Court on March 13, 2014. On March 15, 2014, the Supreme Court stayed the execution, following an appeal filed by the convicts.
However, it took another three years for the Nirbhaya rapists’ appeal to be rejected on May 5, 2017, by the Supreme Court which described the crime as “barbaric” and as something which had shaken “society’s conscience,” a point which had already been made by the first trial judge Yogesh Khanna on September 13, 2013. The delay in the Supreme Court was described as “inexcusable” by the then Supreme Court Bar Association president Dushyant Dave in an interview with the India Today weekly news-magazine. The delay was attributed to the time taken in setting up a three-judge bench. On July 9, 2018, a review petition filed by the convicts was rejected by the Supreme Court. By which date, more than four years had elapsed since the Delhi High Court upheld the death-sentence. And all this despite the unanimous recommendation of the Justice Verma Committee (set up in the wake of the horrific Nirbhaya crime) to fast-track judgment and enhance punishment in such horrendous cases.
If the Supreme Court judges are overburdened with hundreds of cases, then is it necessary for every death sentence confirmed by a High Court to be referred to the apex court? Surely, the judges of the High Court would have applied their minds before confirming the death sentence issued on the Nirbhaya case or any other case. In any case, since the Supreme Court judges are in almost all cases those who are elevated from the High Court, there cannot be that much of a difference in the quality of the Bench or the seriousness with which matters of life-and-death are heard.
The question could, therefore, be asked whether the Supreme Court is taking too much on itself and not just on matters of life and death but even far less important issues like cricket and the functioning of the BCCI. For instance, once the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on reforming the BCCI, the process should have been left to the Committee of Administrators (CoA).
Instead, we now have the ludicrous issue of the sexist comments made by Hardik Pandya and K L Rahul on a TV chat-show being referred to the Supreme Court even though both cricketers have not only admitted their guilt (which, in any case, was telecast) but have also agreed to accept whatever punishment is meted out to them.
The Pandya-Rahul sexist comments’ matter was referred to the Supreme Court because the two-member CoA could not agree on the procedure. The obvious solution would have been to increase the membership of the CoA from two to three so that the majority opinion could prevail. However, something as elementary as increasing the membership of the CoA was not dealt with for months and months.
The referring of the cricketers’ sexist comments matter to the Supreme Court and its referral to a subsequent hearing because of the absence of the court-appointed amicus curiae (who had resigned and who had to be replaced) only meant that Pandya and Rahul had to miss four one-day internationals (ODIs), the three matches in Australia and the first of the games in New Zealand.
It was only at that stage that a new amicus curiae (meaning impartial adviser to a court of law) was appointed and he opined that the suspension of Pandya and Rahul could be revoked and that they be allowed to play until a court-appointed BCCI ombudsman examined the case and gave his verdict on whether the cricketers needed to be punished and, if so, the quantum of punishment.
Whereas, the initial response of the CoA chairman Vinod Rai (with his colleague Diana Edulji not agreeing to the procedure suggested by him) was that a deterrent punishment in the form of a two-match ban would suffice. Now if the BCCI ombudsman to be appointed by the Supreme Court decides that a two-match ban is adequate, how do you ‘unpunish’ Pandya and Rahul who have already been prevented from playing four ODIs!

15,1617655176-216,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Some comments on your clarifications Mr. Gogoi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Outraged/some-comments-on-your-clarifications-mr-gogoi/,Some comments on your clarifications Mr. Gogoi,"March 23, 2020, 8:45 PM  IST","Dear Mr. Gogoi,
You gave a rather combative interview in the press after taking oath in the Rajya Sabha within four months of your retiring as the Chief Justice of the country’s highest court. You obviously believe from your court-room experiences that when one has a weak case, attack is the best defense.  I am tempted to summarize some of your more telling comments in that interview (Times of India, March 20, 2020).
You observed, “Independence of judiciary means breaking the stranglehold of half-a- dozen people over it. Unless this stranglehold is broken, judiciary cannot be independent. They hold judges to ransom….If a case is not decided in a particular way advocated by them, they malign the judge in every way possible… .”  So in your narrative, by joining the Rajya Sabha, you are being a buccaneer out to break that stranglehold. You dismissed criticism that your nomination was quid pro quo for the Ayodhya and Rafale judgments, saying you were being slandered because you deﬁed the “lobby”.
Well Mr Gogoi, let me share some of my thoughts on your statements. Firstly, if you did not manage to break the stranglehold of those ‘half a dozen people’ as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, after decades of serving in the judiciary, your chances of doing so post-retirement from outside the Supreme Court and from the the Rajya Sabha in your twilight years, are lower than a worm’s belly button. Further, if I recall right, “the lobby” as you sneeringly call your critics, objected more to your non-transparent roster allocation for several important cases in which the ruling government was a party. This they did in an open manner even if the action of a press conference was unusual. But according to them, many of their missives to you on the matter had fallen on deaf ears. Besides, it is not as if their worst fears were not seemingly justified.
Let’s see what your Ayodhya judgment was. The judgment averred that the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the 1949 desecration of the Babri Masjid were in violation of law. But it went on to uphold the land title for the Hindu side and ordered the government to allot a 5-acre plot elsewhere to the Sunni Waqf Board. Surprise, surprise! The government was happy and the majority of the country had no reason to complain; except those who wondered whether judgments weren’t supposed to be logical.
And Rafale? The judgment gave a clean chit to the present government in the Rafale fighter jets deal case, saying that the review petitions were without merit, while also ruling out the contention that there was any need for registration of FIR in connection with the deal. Now is that normal?
You have averred in your interview that, “…a judge is not true to his oath if he does not decide a case according to his conscience… I decide according to what my conscience tells me is correct. Otherwise, I am not being true as a judge… .” At another point you ask, “…by levelling quid pro quo allegation, aren’t they questioning the integrity of all the judges involved in the two judgments?” You seemingly trash the “insinuation” that your nomination to Rajya Sabha was part of a quid pro quo where you delivered verdicts suitable to the government. According to you, “Those who are criticising acceptance of nomination as quid pro quo must grant a better sense of proportion to a former CJI. If a former CJI wants quid pro quo, then he could seek bigger, lucrative posts with bigger emoluments and facilities and not a nomination to RS, where the pecuniary beneﬁts are same as that of a retired judge. But I have decided that if the rules permit, I will not take salary and allowances from the RS and give it for refurbishing libraries of law colleges in small towns.”
You finally ask, “Is a former CJI who has spent 20 years as a constitutional judge not suitable to be nominated to RS under Article 80 of the Constitution where the President makes the choice on the aid and advice of the council of ministers? In what way does a retired judge compromise the independence of judiciary by accepting nomination?” And regarding your joining the Rajya Sabha, you also say, “I never was, never am and never will be afraid of anyone’s opinion (except my wife’s)…”
Well Mr. Gogoi, it is precisely your conscience that is under question. After all, you had also chosen to preside over the bench that heard the case of sexual harassment in which you yourself were the accused. And apparently you did not record anywhere that you headed that bench. Didn’t one of your senior colleagues, former Supreme Court Judge N Santosh Hegde go on record saying “Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi hearing a case involving sexual harassment allegations against him was “wholly wrong both in law and morality”? Or was that criticism also misplaced? Where was your judicial conscience at the time sir? Were Justices Chelameswar, Lokur and Kurian too making mere baseless allegations?
And yes, it is nobody’s case that politicians will not try to rope in a CJI into political positions. In the world of adults, the quid-pro-quos don’t have to be spelt aloud. But yes, a former CJI is definitely not expected to lend himself to such a temptation, so that the arm’s length distance between judiciary and the executive is always maintained. That is indeed the crux of the arguments of all those who are being critical of you today, as much as they were of some of the judgments under your tenure at the Supreme Court. If that’s not obvious to you after twenty years of constitutional judgments, there isn’t much we can add. But imagine if every serving judge had an eye on a political appointment post retirement!
And incidentally Mr. Gogoi, the question here is hardly of the pecuniary benefits of a position. But even so, it would be interesting to know if you have vacated your Lutyen’s bungalow. In any case, perhaps we are deviating from the principle of the matter and talking commerce?
Elsewhere you ask, “Why was this same bunch silent when the Supreme Court dealt with the case relating to irregular allotment of 2G spectrum only through sealed cover reports? Why are they silent when the SC was given ‘sealed cover report’ on Shaheen Bagh protests? Why is it not being questioned?”
I can only say you have already started speaking like a seasoned politician. A crafty politician, when cornered with a difficult question on some excessive state action in AMU invariably counters with, ‘where were you when Kashmiri Pundits were being banished from Kashmir?’ Yes sir, you have learnt fast.
As to you maintaining that you “never were, never are and never will be afraid of anyone’s opinion (except your wife’s), well Sir, no one is accusing you of being concerned about the feelings of the rest of the world about your conduct.  Had you been sensitive you wouldn’t have been a Rajya Sabha member today.

16,1617655071-191,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Hashimpura and the Samajwadi silence: What lies beneath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/return-of-the-native/hashimpura-and-the-samajwadi-silence-what-lies-beneath/,Hashimpura and the Samajwadi silence: What lies beneath,"March 31, 2015, 11:41 AM  IST","With the 2017 elections just around the corner, the disappointing verdict in the Hashimpura massacre should have been reason enough to raise some bile among Uttar Pradesh’s ruling Samajwadis. In contrast, there’s only been stoic silence, both by Mulayam Singh Yadav and his vitriol-spewing colleague Azam Khan, or even, for that matter, by UP’s chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
Far from announcing that the state government would go in appeal against the special court’s verdict, the Samajwadi Party government appears to be dragging its feet on the matter. Muslims groups and “outside” political outfits like Owaisi’s AIMIM, have, instead, come forward in show of support, offering to even bear litigation costs for victims who want to challenge the court’s decision.
What’s curious is that Hashimpura is a big contributor to what makes Mulayam the man he is, today. Though he wasn’t the leader of opposition when the massacre occurred, the Lokdal, of which MSY was then a part, was the party that raised a pitch for the need for an independent investigation into the Hashimpura killings. But from 1989, since he first became chief minister, the dharti putra who also earned himself the moniker of ‘Mullah Mulayam’, appears to have quickly, and quietly, forgotten where his loyalties lie.
The Samajwadi Party, though, has the unique distinction of swinging this way and that, depending on which way the political current blows. In 1989-1990, he won himself over to the minorities by ordering the firing at a group of kar sevaks on their way to Ayodhya. But in the years that followed, the secular Samajwadis could never explain why an independent probe into Hashimpura could not be conducted, especially in the years they were in power. They could never say why, also, the families of the victim were denied a special public prosecutor to defend the legal rights of the Hashimpura victims until the Supreme Court intervened in 2004. Nor can the Samajwadis explain the reasons for their silence now, especially when a clearly lopsided judgment in the biggest pre-Ayodhya massacre offers them another chance to win some political brownie points.
Perhaps, now, reaching out to the Hindu voter is more expedient than to appease the long-forgotten Hashimpura victim or any other Muslim. In the light of the saffron surge, consolidating their Hindu vote bank is possibly the new challenge. Why else, after the openly communal role of the PAC in the Hashimpura incident, would the SP government depute the PAC again during the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013? That’s probably why, at Lohia’s birth anniversary in March, MSY appeared to worry over his “Hindu” image and how it had taken a hit during the Ayodhya firing incident. That’s why also, while they have continued to sponsor Haj visits, it’s the Samajwadi Party special train to Haridwar and Rishikesh for Hindu pilgrims that’s got all the eyeballs. The soft Hindutva touch is nicely couched within Akhilesh’s development-for-all poll plank. But if past experiences are anything to go by, it’s unlikely voters on either side will fall for it this time.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",with the 2017 elections just around the corner the disappointing verdict in the hashimpura massacre should have been reason enough to raise some bile among uttar pradeshs ruling samajwadis in contrast theres only been stoic silence both by mulayam singh yadav and his vitriolspewing colleague azam khan or even for that matter by ups chief minister akhilesh yadavfar from announcing that the state government would go in appeal against the special courts verdict the samajwadi party government appears to be dragging its feet on the matter muslims groups and outside political outfits like owaisis aimim have instead come forward in show of support offering to even bear litigation costs for victims who want to challenge the courts decisionwhats curious is that hashimpura is a big contributor to what makes mulayam the man he is today though he wasnt the leader of opposition when the massacre occurred the lokdal of which msy was then a part was the party that raised a pitch for the need for an independent investigation into the hashimpura killings but from 1989 since he first became chief minister the dharti putra who also earned himself the moniker of mullah mulayam appears to have quickly and quietly forgotten where his loyalties liethe samajwadi party though has the unique distinction of swinging this way and that depending on which way the political current blows in 19891990 he won himself over to the minorities by ordering the firing at a group of kar sevaks on their way to ayodhya but in the years that followed the secular samajwadis could never explain why an independent probe into hashimpura could not be conducted especially in the years they were in power they could never say why also the families of the victim were denied a special public prosecutor to defend the legal rights of the hashimpura victims until the supreme court intervened in 2004 nor can the samajwadis explain the reasons for their silence now especially when a clearly lopsided judgment in the biggest preayodhya massacre offers them another chance to win some political brownie pointsperhaps now reaching out to the hindu voter is more expedient than to appease the longforgotten hashimpura victim or any other muslim in the light of the saffron surge consolidating their hindu vote bank is possibly the new challenge why else after the openly communal role of the pac in the hashimpura incident would the sp government depute the pac again during the muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 thats probably why at lohias birth anniversary in march msy appeared to worry over his hindu image and how it had taken a hit during the ayodhya firing incident thats why also while they have continued to

17,1617655210-225,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Building temples unlikely to pay poll dividends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Swaminomics/building-temples-unlikely-to-pay-poll-dividends/,Building temples unlikely to pay poll dividends,"August 9, 2020, 8:30 AM  IST","The bhoomi pujan for the new Ram temple at Ayodhya has hogged the headlines and has been called a historical event by both Hindutva stalwarts and bitter Hindutva critics, with one group cheering and the other groaning about the transition of a secular India into a BJP-Hindutva dominated one.
Forget this hype and razzmatazz. The Ram temple will turn out to be a minor event with no serious political consequences.
When the Babri Masjid was destroyed in 1992, I thought that was a gamechanger that would launch endless attempts by the BJP to demolish hundreds of other mosques and build new Hindu temples on these sites. Having succeeded so spectacularly in harnessing Hindu passions over the Babri Masjid, I was certain the BJP would repeat this again and again to profit politically as a champion of ancient Hindu honour.
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao passed a law saying that henceforth the character of no religious place could be changed. But I thought that law would easily be reversed or amended to irrelevance when the BJP came to power. I feared India was about to descend into Hindu-Muslim terrorism, with vigilantes on both sides accelerating the mayhem. I thought I was vindicated by the post-Babri Mumbai pogrom of Bal Thackeray in Mumbai, to which Muslim don Dawood Ibrahim responded with his serial Mumbai bomb blasts. Many other analysts shared these fears.
Happily, we were proved dead wrong. Narasimha Rao took the gamble of dismissing the BJP-ruled state governments in UP, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, and holding fresh elections there in 1993. The BJP expected a resounding victory, since it believed mosque’s destruction was very popular with the Hindu masses. Besides, Narasimha Rao’s image had been tarnished by the stock market collapse of 1992 and the claim of master manipulator Harshad Mehta that he had personally bribed Rao with Rs 1 crore.
Yet the BJP was beaten in all four states. With the help of Independents it returned to office in Rajasthan, but was decisively rejected in the other three states, above all in Uttar Pradesh. In the next decade the BJP made repeated efforts to stoke Hindu passion for building a Ram temple on the Babri site, yet lost ground steadily in the state. It slipped to no. 4 position after the SP, BSP and Congress. This proved that mob violence can more easily be harnessed for destruction than construction.
The Ram temple is coming up today not because the BJP won a great popular victory but because the Supreme Court came out with an odd verdict that slammed BJP vigilantes for destroying the Babri Masjid and categorically named the Muslims as victims, yet created a new trust to build a Ram temple. Between 1992 and 2019, the BJP tried hard but failed dismally to excite Hindus about building a new temple in Ayodhya. Indeed its comeback in UP after 2014 was due entirely to Modi’s new image of a nationalist who would get tough with Pakistan, provide millions of new jobs, and squelch Congress corruption. Its comeback had nothing to do with renewed popular passion for a Ram temple.
Modi’s tough nationalism and strikes at Uri and Balakot were highly popular, and paid dividends in the 2019 general election. But the Amit Shah-inspired aim in state elections to raise communal temperatures and label Muslims as pro-Pakistani traitors clearly failed. The BJP fared badly in 10 state elections in a row — Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana and Delhi. The Delhi campaign was the most communal, with the BJP accusing the peaceful, patriotic Muslim agitators at Shaheen Bagh of being Pakistani agents. Yet the BJP was thrashed electorally, winning only 8 of 70 seats.
Although the BJP is India’s biggest party by far, it is nowhere near hegemony. Its strategy of polarising the electorate has yielded dismal electoral outcomes. The centre of gravity of Indian politics has indeed shifted away from Nehruvian secularism, and the Congress has tried (though in vain) to portray itself as a Hindutva-lite party.
Yet the BJP’s poor performance in a string of state elections shows that its strength lies overwhelmingly in Modi’s personal popularity, not in communalism or temple building. India has lakhs of temples to dozens of deities, and one more in Ayodhya will make little difference. Indian voters have a thousand complaints about their rulers, exacerbated by Covid-19 and a sick economy that was already slipping badly before the disease struck. If the BJP cannot succeed on these fronts, it will not be saved by building temples at Ayodhya or anywhere else.

     Aiyar, it's so weird that the number of non-Hindus like you are so irate at the Ram temple. Just because you as a non-Hindu just like your European overlord McCauly hate hinduism and Indian tradtions doesn't mean temple construction should stop. Hindus are here are to say, non-Hindus like you can take a hike if you dont like it....  Read More

18,1617655079-193,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Confusion And Rahul Gandhi: Gandhi scion’s UP campaign cannot resurrect party by harking back to older battles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/academic-interest/confusion-and-rahul-gandhi-gandhi-scions-up-campaign-cannot-resurrect-party-by-harking-back-to-older-battles/,Confusion And Rahul Gandhi: Gandhi scion’s UP campaign cannot resurrect party by harking back to older battles,"September 16, 2016, 10:41 PM  IST","He was photographed eating jalebis and samosas at a dusty roadside shop in Mau; ate roti-chokha for lunch with yet another Dalit couple, Rukmini Devi and Swaminath Ram, in the same district; and spouted a new poll slogan, “janta trast hai, Modiji mast hai” to follow up his trademark “suit-boot ki sarkar” jibe.
Rahul Gandhi seemed to be ticking off all the checkboxes in the standard PR playbook – even if the kisans took away some of the khats from his khat sabhas – travelling 824 km from Deoria to Ghazipur during the first leg of his UP kisan mahayatra this month. Yet, his latest roadshow raises more questions than answers.
In a month in which he flip-flopped his way to eventually throwing down the gauntlet to RSS on whether it backed Mahatma Gandhi’s killers or not, the big question is whether we are seeing the beginning of a sustainable political recasting of Rahul and a rekindled Congress? Or is this just a rehash of the same old template of speak-dash-disappear we have seen in the past – from Bhatta Parsaul to Niyamgiri?
It is an important question, not because it will have a substantial impact on the Uttar Pradesh election next year – a state where, after all, Congress had just 28 of 403 MLAs, only 11.65% vote-share and where its candidates in 2012 lost their deposits in as many as 240 seats – but because of its bearing on the larger leadership, succession and existential question marks around Congress and its post-2014 drift.
So, what does Rahul’s new turn in UP tell us? First, Congress’s UP messaging has left everyone, including many of its own workers, confused. UP, at last count, had the highest percentage of indebted farmer households in India and Rahul’s focus on them with the slogan of “karza maaf, bijli ka bill half, MSP ka karo hisaab” (waive loans, halve electricity bills, settle minimum support price) at a time of agrarian crisis is a calculated gambit. The problem is that while Rahul has been repeating this message ad nauseam in his khat sabhas it has gotten muddled and confused by his own photo ops elsewhere.
If farmers are the focus, then why suddenly choose to become the first in your family in two decades to go to Ayodhya for puja in the Hanumangarhi temple? Ayodhya is a totem pole in the iconography of Hindutva. A public visit there by a politician on election yatra goes beyond spiritual signalling alone. Except that it was followed up next day with lunch at the Arabia Riyazul Uloom Guraini Madarsa in Jaunpur and then a “Brahman Samaj pooja”. It begs the question: who exactly is the Congress targeting and what is its electoral aim in UP?
The confusion over its political positioning means that Congress should not be surprised by Hanumangarhi’s chief priest promptly announcing after Rahul left that he is a “good human being” but “no one was better than Akhilesh Yadav”. Congress’s old strategy of being all things to all people is redundant in a state like UP where it has long been a marginal player. This is why its political managers came up with idea of projecting a Brahmin face as its CM candidate, as a way of rebuilding its own caste base. Rahul, though, seems to be reading from a different, older song sheet.
Second, we have seen this Rahul script and media-focussed poverty tourism before. It didn’t turn crowds into votes in 2012 for Congress. It is unlikely to now. From the Vidarbha widow Kalavati Bandurkar, who he visited in 2008 and talked about in Parliament, to his interventions in the 2011 Bhatta Parsaul protests over land acquisition, Rahul has a penchant for raising the plight of the downtrodden but questions over his consistency and inability to follow up remain.
Third, apart from generous doses of Modi-bashing in UP and promising a sarkar of the poor and farmers, the Gandhi scion is yet to spell out clear solutions for what he will do for the poor beyond expressing solidarity with them and complaining about poverty. Most farmers, for example, do not want their kids to remain farmers, as a 2013 CSDS survey found. While nobody likes crony capitalism, many rural folk may actually aspire to wear a “suit-boot”. What is Rahul’s message for aspirational India?
Fourth, Rahul has pinned his colours to the mast on one issue: an ideological war with RSS on Gandhiji’s murder. Even here though, Rahul first seemed to breathe defiance – appearing in person before a Bhiwandi local court in May 2015 where he talked of an “ideological battle” – before climbing down in the Bombay high court saying that he had never blamed RSS as an institution, only to revert again to an aggressive posture. He seemed to backtrack again in the Supreme Court when his lawyer argued that he had blamed a person associated with RSS, not the Sangh as a whole, before changing tack again and telling the apex court that he would “never withdraw” his word on RSS.
If Congress wants to take on RSS ideologically then appearing shifty hardly aspires confidence. At another level, the Gandhi and RSS case may evoke headlines but it is hardly a vote magnet.
The legal verdict on Gandhiji’s assassination was given seven decades ago, examined in detail by the Kapur Commission and the evidence has long been in the public domain. It may lend itself to drawing room chatter. But in a country where bijli, sadak, pani matter the most, harking back to older battles is hardly the template to revive a moribund Congress.

19,1617655331-254,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The piles of Ayodhya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/strategic-insights/the-piles-of-ayodhya/,The piles of Ayodhya,"January 15, 2016, 3:35 PM  IST","So they are at it again. In raking up the dirt of Ayodhya and piling up stones there that have given piles to independent India like nothing else in its 68-year old history.
It was the sagacious Vajpayee who, throughout his six-year rule, kept the Ayodhya issue in abeyance by keeping the Sangh Parivar at bay. For he knew that with his ascension to power, the issue had outlived its purpose, and would only derail his government if resurrected.
Then of course came the verdict of the Allahabad High Court. Creative in the extreme, it was fortunately set aside by the Supreme Court. And there the matter rests.
Or so we thought. Until the Sangh Parivar started piling up stones in Ayodhya. Are they trying to influence the Supreme Court with a show of strength, and thereby give a decision in their favour? Know they not that the court has directed that the status quo be maintained at the disputed site?
Or are they trying to impress the nation, and in particular the minority community, that the Raj is now theirs, and that they can do what they want.
Modi is no Vajpayee, but witness his response, in word and deed, to the attack in Pathankot, and you will find a man who is not hostage to Nagpur. Admittedly he will allow a minister to continue when she taps into her support within the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, as was the case with Sushma Swaraj in Lalitgate, or allow his protégé, Amit Shah, to be raked over the coals by RSS supremo Mohan Bhagwat after the BJP’s debacle in the Bihar elections, but he has shown in the past that a puppet he is not.
In Gujarat, as chief minister, he had visibly tamed the RSS and put to pasture Praveen Togadia, the honcho of the RSS’s offshoot, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who is again up to his dirty tricks in Ayodhya.
Now Modi has an international reputation to protect. Notice how defensive he and his lieutenants became on the intolerance debate. He has a country to run. He has allies that he has to keep by his side, and a virulent opposition that needs only the slightest excuse to run afoul of him to thwart.
Message to the Sangh Parivar: If you want to protect your Raj, turn those stones into rubble. Right now. And now means now. And wait for the decision of the Supreme Court. Which you know you are constitutionally bound to accept. Whether you like it or lump it.

20,1617655206-224,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The Prime Minister’s presence at Ram temple Bhoomi poojan was only ‘natural’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-fact/the-prime-ministers-presence-at-ram-temple-bhoomi-poojan-was-only-natural/,The Prime Minister’s presence at Ram temple Bhoomi poojan was only ‘natural’,"August 8, 2020, 2:00 PM  IST","Addressing select invitees after laying foundation stone of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya the Prime Minister said that his presence at the ceremony was ‘natural’. This feeling and expression thereof by the executive head of the country signified a great meaning. There had been considerable questions raised on his acceptance of the invitation for the bhoomipoojan ceremony – the main argument being as head of the govt he should have avoided being at the function which was purely religious one. Many arguments were also placed in favor of his accepting the invitation too citing such precedents and justifying his decision to be at the function.
By terming his presence ‘natural’ he made the issue too simple and casual. But how come his presence be seen as natural? There might be three dimensions of this feeling which need to be seen in a proper perspective without prejudice :– 
One, The Prime Minister is a devout Hindu with his core belief and pride in being so. One does not and must not shed and leave the core principles that determine and guide his entire ethos of leading his life journey, becoming and discharging his responsibilities as the Prime Minister of this country being part of the great journey of his life. Not accepting and acting being and remaining so to the core and pretending to be seen otherwise is simply hypocrisy. 
Narendra Modi – the person – must be seen to be honest feeling proud of his ethos, ethics and of course, of his religion which only shape his personality into becoming a true-hearted and committed Chief of executive of the country. In many ways, throughout his tenure till date, he has exposed the contradictions and irony of leaders being perceived and seen as secular but otherwise being hardcore communal and even following a politics of divide and hatred among fellow citizens. 
Rahul remains secular if he starts visiting temples and becomes a Janeudhari Brahmin during elections, the successive Congress leaders and Prime Ministers too remain secular visiting temples, following sadhus and acting on their advices but Narendra Modi is deprived of that privilege simply because he wants to be seen as he is. 
Two, Narendra Modi has been a RSS Pracharak, a grass-root BJP functionary which only enabled him serve the country becoming the highest functionary of the country. He did come up where he is with only and only due to his core commitment to the convictions of his character and his earnest urge to serve his nation. He has never been a power seeker – power just came to him on a platter just as sacrament of his irrevocable and austerity. And now when the organization he worked for so selflessly and tirelessly was going to achieve a long cherished milestone, it was so natural for him to be honored being not only part of but being the guest of honor of the occasion which comes rare in one’s life. 
Three, the construction of the temple is the result of hon’ble Apex Court judgment of a case which had been pending from eternity. People just left thinking of any resolution – an endless litigation with fed up litigants. Many govt just went by, so were successive courts. It had been during Narendra Modi govt that the court could deliver a verdict solving the age old dispute. Any govt would be proud of the achievement and enjoy the glory of being at the helm during the times as historic as these. Had Congress been in power during the times, the govt and the party would have grabbed the glory from both the hands and would have created much of hypes and fanfare of the event publicizing this as their great achievement. Any executive head would feel proud being part of the event becoming possible during his governance period. Narendra Modi has been quite moderate while attending the function and not appearing taking credit of the show.
Construction of Ram temple at his birth place is a national event of historical moment and though Lord Ram, incidentally belongs to the Hindu tradition of faith and worship, the legacy largely remains more of Indian culture. The temple would be one more symbol of our rich heritage and great civilization across faiths and religions. Ayodhya, with this temple, would become one of many such places in the country signifying our relationship with great ancient proud past and civilization uniting and embracing all of us.
Whenever we talk of an ideal person, we imagine of Ram and whenever to think of an ideal state, we imagine of Ram Rajya. The Mahatma talked of it too often so did many other philosophers. So it would be reasonable to conclude that Ram or Ram Rajya remains an ideal to achieve and has very little to do with core Hindu religion and faith. It would be only wise and prudent that we move ahead taking the event and the temple as progression of the ideals our society that country stands for. The Prime Minister too invoked the same sentiments while talking at the event. For him the temple ‘will reflect the rich heritage of Indian culture’ and will ‘inspire the entire humanity till eternity’. It has also been noteworthy that BJP, quite understandably, refrained from any unnecessary propaganda out of the event and avoided any show off surrounding the event.
Mood in Ayodhya has been too smooth and conciliatory and communities have been seen to be comfortable. Entire local population was observed in celebratory mood. The sentiment was nicely expressed by Iqbal Ansari the son of Hashim Ansari, one of the litigants of the historic case, who attended the event and said that eventually ‘our Hindu brothers are with us and we are with them in their moment of joy’. It would be wise if outsiders do not ruin the inter community faith at the place. Some of the comments and reactions have been crude and cruel like Sajid Rashidi, the president of All India Imam Association that a mosque would be built after demolishing the temple. Some Hindu ‘intellectuals’ too went ahead with avoidable comments deploring crudely not even the event but also construction of the temple itself. It remains the beauty of the Hindu religion and its practitioners that such comments are not only tolerated but respected too.  
Indian history is already riddled with too much of religious hatred against Hindus by foreign aggressors, the historians among so-called liberal democrats do know it too well than others. It is always better to let the ugly and vulgar facts remain under debris of history and not open the wounds. Gone are the days when ‘people’ were continuously befooled by self-proclaimed thinkers and philosophers. The present generation Indians are capable of seeing and understanding for themselves the rights and wrongs of the history as well as of the current developments of events shaping the history. The construction of the temple is an historical turning point eliminating anything wrong in the past. Everyone in the country from litigants to politicians to the general public continuously and repeated vowed to respect and go by the verdict of the court. The day of the verdict by the honourable Supreme Court is the greatest testimony of the eternal ethos of fraternity among us when all sections of people, across faiths and religions, did welcome the verdict and hoped for a more united and dynamic society. That spirit and sentiment has to be respected and taken forward. Let us not try taking the people back from the historic day and facilitate them look ahead with new hopes and positive aspirations!

that ram or ram rajya remains an ideal to achieve and has very little to do with core hindu religion and faith it would be only wise and prudent that we move ahead taking the event and the temple as progression of the ideals our society that country stands for the prime minister too invoked the same sentiments while talking at the event for him the temple will reflect the rich heritage of indian culture and will inspire the entire humanity till eternity it has also been noteworthy that bjp quite understandably refrained from any unnecessary propaganda out of the event and avoided any show off surrounding the eventmood in ayodhya has been too smooth and conciliatory and communities have been seen to be comfortable entire local population was observed in celebratory mood the sentiment was nicely expressed by iqbal ansari the son of hashim ansari one of the litigants of the historic case who attended the event and said that eventually our hindu brothers are with us and we are with them in their moment of joy it would be wise if outsiders do not ruin the inter community faith at the place some of the comments and reactions have been crude and cruel like sajid rashidi the president of all india imam association that a mosque would be built after demolishing the temple some hindu intellectuals too went ahead with avoidable comments deploring crudely not even the event but also construction of the temple itself it remains the beauty of the hindu religion and its practitioners that such comments are not only tolerated but respected too  indian history is already riddled with too much of religious hatred against hindus by foreign aggressors the historians among socalled liberal democrats do know it too well than others it is always better to let the ugly and vulgar facts remain under debris of history and not open the wounds gone are the days when people were continuously befooled by selfproclaimed thinkers and philosophers the present generation indians are capable of seeing and understanding for themselves the rights and wrongs of the history as well as of the current developments of events shaping the history the construction of the temple is an historical turning point eliminating anything wrong in the past everyone in the country from litigants to politicians to the general public continuously and repeated vowed to respect and go by the verdict of the court the day of the verdict by the honourable supreme court is the greatest testimony of the eternal ethos of fraternity among us when all sections of people across faiths and religions did welcome the verdict and hoped for a more united and dynamic society that spirit and sentiment has to be respected and taken forward let us not try taking the people back from the historic day and facilitate them look ahead with new hopes and positive aspirations

21,1617655268-238,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,My new India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/think-for-india/my-new-india/,My new India,"November 11, 2019, 10:38 PM  IST","There were two incidents in the last week which showed India in contradictory light but since the later and second incident involved almost the whole nation, the response made me a proud Indian. And that’s the reason I call it merabharat mahaan . As the nation waited with bated breath, with elaborate security arrangements across the country, the judgement on Ayodhya’s Ramjanmabhoomi was announced by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and the other four illustrious judges. In a unanimous landmark verdict, the apex court awarded the land for the Ram mandir but made elaborate arrangements for the masjid too putting the onus on the state and the centre. What makes the verdict special is that it was so brilliantly worded that it truly reflects the secular credentials of new India. There was respect and true concern on each pronouncement as the verdict was read out and there was clarity in the thought process. What the verdict was, as important as it was a long-standing affair that was unresolved, but how the verdict was written and presented as a work of pristine art that sought to balance the aesthetics and the sensitivities. Kudos to the JusticeGogoi and the whole panel. It will be a judgement that will be remembered for long in the annals of history as a tightrope walk that pulled it off.
Apart from the verdict itself, the larger appreciation is for the people of India who reacted with utmost restraint understanding the nature of the verdict. Especially my Muslim friends who respected the apex court and the verdict and the emotions of the majority. Such maturity in the wake of religious sentiments and the risks of a hostile Pakistan making use of this situation, were well and truly averted. So the restraint and relief were visible in the eyes and not just an external show.
The majority community also was aware that any rejoicing was a risk, so the acceptance of the verdict in a matter of fact way and avoiding any provocation at this juncture was expected and happened to the core. All in all, a long-standing dispute stands resolved and the amicable reaction of the countrymen thereafter makes a proud India. This happens only in India!
The first incident that I was referring too was a hue and cry made out of the Sony TV’s KBC question which referred to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as Shivaji only and there were a minuscule number of people who lambasted the use of the name as just Shivaji. I will bring my narrative back to the Ayodhya verdict and generally too we refer to Lord Ram as just Ram ( as in Ram Janmabhoomi or Ram temple or Ram Bhakts) but never have we raised a furore on why every time he was not called Lord Ram or Shri Ram. A majority of India more so the younger generation is least bothered with this nitty-gritty and takes them in the stride instead of pressuring and venting anger on such issues. Neither calling Shri Ram as Ram makes him any less revered nor does Chhatrapati Shivaji lose any of his respect. SonyTV and Amitabh Bachchan had to repeatedly apologise because of the fear of losing viewers and understandably so. But that’s the minuscule number of people of India that made a non-issue an issue and the Ayodhya verdict which had all the ingredients of snowballing was dealt with by India with such secular maturity and mutual respect that the world should learn from.
I am proud of My India. Mera Bharat Mahaan !

22,1617655404-271,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Momentous judgment on Ayodhya: SC’s adjudication of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute represents a new dawn for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/momentous-judgment-on-ayodhya-scs-adjudication-of-ram-janmabhoomi-babri-masjid-dispute-represents-a-new-dawn-for-india/,Momentous judgment on Ayodhya: SC’s adjudication of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute represents a new dawn for India,"November 13, 2019, 8:26 AM  IST","Lord Ram is also known as Maryada Purushottam. Dignity and ethics are central to his conduct and philosophy. His story for the last thousands of years continues to animate and inspire the psyche of ordinary Indians and remains a proud narrative of our civilisational, cultural and spiritual heritage.  
It was only fitting and appropriate that the long pending dispute for last hundreds of years about his place of birth “Ram Janmabhoomi” at Ayodhya, was finally settled by the Supreme Court after an elaborate hearing of more than 40 days by a unanimous verdict of five judges. An issue which was contentious, full of competing claims and interests many times giving rise to conflicts and hostility, could be resolved in a perfectly lawful manner consistent with the Maryada of our constitutional polity.  
It is equally reassuring that the entire country has accepted this judgment. There is no discord or hostility on the ground and a rare amity, brotherhood and understanding has been witnessed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a leader deserves full praise for his appeal which played a cardinal role in this amity as also the requisite administrative arrangement. It is indeed a new dawn for India.

There were basically four suits. One filed by a worshipper Gopal Singh Visharad, second by Nirmohi Akhara, third by UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and fourth by the deity itself “Ram Lalla Virajman”, who claimed a declaration of title to the disputed site coupled with injunctive relief. The Allahabad high court gave relief to the Hindus with the right to pray in the main area and also allotting it to them. It further proceeded to partition the disputed area one-third each to Hindus, Nirmohi Akhara and Muslims.  
The judgment of the Allahabad HC was challenged in the Supreme Court, which led to the decision of the Supreme Court. There was voluminous evidence on record – both oral and documentary – consisting of thousands of pages. The Supreme Court in the judgment elaborately considered the interplay of all these evidences. It would only be appropriate to recall some of these. 
Joseph Tieffenthaler was a Jesuit missionary who visited India in 1740. He notes the sacred character of Ayodhya, which he called Adjudea. In particular, he mentions a “Bedi” – a cradle – where Beschan (Vishnu) was born in the form of Ram. Alexander Cunningham, director general of Archaeological Survey of India, refers to Ayodhya in his 1862 report as the birthplace of Lord Ram. P Carnegie, commissioner and settlement officer of Faizabad, mentions in his 1870 report that “Ajudhia is to Hindus what Mecca is to Mohammedans”. 
The court concluded vide para 786 that travelogues of foreigners provide a detailed account both of the faith and belief of Hindus based on the sanctity which they ascribe to the birthplace of Lord Ram and to the actual worship by Hindus of the Janm Sthan. Very significantly, the court further noted that for a period of 325 years from the date of the construction of the mosque until installation of a grill wall by the British, no evidence has been adduced by the Muslims to establish the exercise of possessory control over the disputed site.  
The court held that the oral and documentary evidence shows that the devotees of Lord Ram hold a genuine longstanding and profound belief in the religious merit attained by offering prayer to Lord Ram at the site they believe to be his birthplace. Significantly the court mentioned the acknowledgments by Muslim witnesses about the presence of Hindu religious symbols like Varah, Jai-Vijay and Garud outside the three-dome structure. The court further held, “They are suggestive not merely of the existence of faith and belief but of actual worship down the centuries.” Quite clearly, what was brought down was not just brick and mortar but a vibrant and active symbol and place of worship for millions of Hindus through centuries. 
While decreeing the suit in favour of Ram Lalla plaintiff of the Hindus in substance, the court also decided to provide restitution to the Muslim community by directing the government to allocate five acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board. The central government has been directed to formulate a scheme envisaging the setting up of a trust for the management as also construction of a temple. It has also been given the liberty to hand over the rest of the acquired land for development in terms of the scheme. The order of the Allahabad HC was set aside and the suit of Nirmohi Akhara was dismissed.  
Significantly the court observed the practice of religion, Islam being no exception, varies according to the cultural and social context. Cultural assimilation is a significant factor which shaped the manner in which religion is practised, because cultural assimilation cannot be construed as a feature destructive of religious doctrine. Surely the heritage of Kabir, Rahim and Raskhan stands vindicated today. For me it was an honour and privilege to argue this case on behalf of Ram Lalla and Hindus in the Allahabad HC.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",lord ram is also known as maryada purushottam dignity and ethics are central to his conduct and philosophy his story for the last thousands of years continues to animate and inspire the psyche of ordinary indians and remains a proud narrative of our civilisational cultural and spiritual heritage  it was only fitting and appropriate that the long pending dispute for last hundreds of years about his place of birth ram janmabhoomi at ayodhya was finally settled by the supreme court after an elaborate hearing of more than 40 days by a unanimous verdict of five judges an issue which was contentious full of competing claims and interests many times giving rise to conflicts and hostility could be resolved in a perfectly lawful manner consistent with the maryada of our constitutional polity  it is equally reassuring that the entire country has accepted this judgment there is no discord or hostility on the ground and a rare amity brotherhood and understanding has been witnessed prime minister narendra modi as a leader deserves full praise for his appeal which played a cardinal role in this amity as also the requisite administrative arrangement it is indeed a new dawn for india  illustration ajit ninanthere were basically four suits one filed by a worshipper gopal singh visharad second by nirmohi akhara third by up sunni central waqf board and fourth by the deity itself ram lalla virajman who claimed a declaration of title to the disputed site coupled with injunctive relief the allahabad high court gave relief to the hindus with the right to pray in the main area and also allotting it to them it further proceeded to partition the disputed area onethird each to hindus nirmohi akhara and muslims  the judgment of the allahabad hc was challenged in the supreme court which led to the decision of the supreme court there was voluminous evidence on record – both oral and documentary – consisting of thousands of pages the supreme court in the judgment elaborately considered the interplay of all these evidences it would only be appropriate to recall some of these joseph tieffenthaler was a jesuit missionary who visited india in 1740 he notes the sacred character of ayodhya which he called adjudea in particular he mentions a bedi – a cradle – where beschan vishnu was born in the form of ram alexander cunningham director general of archaeological survey of india refers to ayodhya in his 1862 report as the birthplace of lord ram p carnegie commissioner and settlement officer of faizabad mentions in his 1870 report that ajudhia is to hindus what mecca is to mohammedans the court concluded vide para 786 that travelogues of foreigners provide a detailed account both of the faith and belief of hindus based on the sanctity which they ascribe to the birthplace of lord ram and to the actual worship by hindus of the janm sthan very significantly the court further noted that for a period of 325 years from the date of the construction of the mosque until installation of a grill wall by the british no evidence has been adduced by the muslims to establish the exercise of possessory control over the disputed site  the court held that the oral and documentary evidence shows that the devotees of lord ram hold a genuine longstanding and profound belief in the religious merit attained by offering prayer to lord ram at the site they believe to be his birthplace significantly the court mentioned the acknowledgments by muslim witnesses about the presence of hindu religious symbols like varah jaivijay and garud outside the threedome structure the court further held they are suggestive not merely of the existence of faith and belief but of actual worship down the centuries quite clearly what was brought down was not just brick and mortar but a vibrant and active symbol and place of worship for millions of hindus through centuries while decreeing the suit in favour of ram lalla plaintiff of the hindus in substance the court also decided to provide restitution to the muslim community by directing the government to allocate five acres of land to the sunni waqf board the central government has been directed to formulate a scheme envisaging the setting up of a trust for the management as also construction of a temple it has also been given the liberty to hand over the rest of the acquired land for development in terms of the scheme the order of the allahabad hc was set aside and the suit of nirmohi akhara was dismissed  significantly the court observed the practice of religion islam being no exception varies according to the cultural and social context cultural assimilation is a

23,1617655431-278,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,In Faruqui’s Shade: Ayodhya title dispute and the Ismail Faruqui verdict need closure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/in-faruquis-shade-ayodhya-title-dispute-and-the-ismail-faruqui-verdict-need-closure/,In Faruqui’s Shade: Ayodhya title dispute and the Ismail Faruqui verdict need closure,"September 27, 2018, 7:58 PM  IST","Supreme Court has dismissed the 1994 Ismail Faruqui judgment’s observation that “a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of Islam and namaz” as having no bearing on the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi title suit. The order paves way for hearings in the title dispute to resume by interpreting the observations in Faruqui in the specific context of government acquiring 67 acres in and around the disputed mosque, which it said “need not be read broadly”. But beyond Ayodhya, this observation in Faruqui is at variance with a secular republic’s mandate to preserve the sanctity of religious places.
Ideally, a seven-judge constitutional bench should review the Faruqui judgment because it gives political oxygen to other historical disputes related to religious structures and raises the possibility of more Ayodhya-like cleavages. Justice Bharucha’s minority view in Faruqui had termed the Ayodhya land acquisition on grounds of preserving public order as constitutionally impermissible. He noted that when adherents of the majority religion used force of numbers to assail the place of worship of another religion and disrupt public order, it was the duty of the state to protect the place of worship, not acquire it to preserve public order.
Justice Abdul Nazeer’s dissenting verdict on Thursday found that Faruqui influenced the 2010 Allahabad high court verdict portioning the land three ways. He asks whether an essential religious practice can be determined without detailed examination of religious tenets, as was the case in the 1994 verdict. In contrast to Faruqui, the Babri title suit must scrupulously strive to stay away from religious arguments and go strictly by property documents and civil laws. The title suit could also be heard by a larger bench, to benefit from more judicial minds applying themselves to the vexed dispute. Matters of religion must not distract from India’s great civilisational project of material and spiritual uplift. The ball is in SC’s court.

     Along with Ram Janambhoomi- Babri Masjid diute, SC should also review the disputed sites of Mathura and  Banaras,  where structures were built forcibly on exiting temples to insult the majority community.  Freedom of religion does not mean encroaching or destroying  other's religious places....  Read More

That makes me 26, bang on India’s median age line (it divides the population into two numerically equal groups; i.e. half the people in India are younger than 26 and half are older).
 
It’s a vantage point, and if you allow me 861 words on behalf of my generation, I’ll try to explain why the riots cloud is all the more confounding to us, especially in cities like Kolkata where we’ve been insulated from such carnage, at least in comparison with a lot of other states. I mean, effigy-burning and train-burning… there’s a difference, right? I’ll also try to show the older generation, to whom Ayodhya matters a lot, why we find the SMS that’s doing the rounds – While India wonders where Ram was born, Australia wonders why (VVS) Laxman was born – as funny as the gmail@rajinikanth.com joke.
 
From what I see, the false alarms ahead of the Babri judgment appeared to have at least one silver lining. Indians were panicking over possible riots ahead of/after the verdict; even as the government kept appealing for peace and yet sent companies of troopers to ""sensitive"" areas. This laid bare the acidic fear both the Centre and the people have developed of communal violence. Here’s the  sent companies of troopers to ""sensitive"" areas. This laid bare the acidic fear both the Centre and the people have developed of communal violence. Here’s the thing, simply because we were hardly anything in 1984, doesn’t mean we didn’t look ’em up. 
 
Though the same goes for the1989 Bhagalpur riots, we did follow the 2002 Gujarat carnage. Some of us even know some behind-the-scenes of the events that have triggered these, right from Partition to 26/11, courtesy the amazing authors India has been blessed to have (or adopt). A short list of these books might not be out of context. Since it’s impossible to name all of them in 140 characters, I’ll only list some of the ones I’ve read thoroughly and have at hand right now.
 
On Partition: As noted by, among others, Ramachandra Guha in his magnum opus ‘India after Gandhi’, to the young generation, ""history"" ends with Partition. This book, along with Urvashi Butalia’s ‘The Other Side of Silence’, examines in detail the biggest two-way exodus in the world and its aftershocks. They also feature in William Dalrymple’s ‘City of Djinns’.
I’ve listed the more recent books, but there are many like ‘Train to Pakistan’, ‘Ice Candy Man’ and ‘Tamas’ which can help readers feel the ripples even 63 years later. Sadat Hasan Manto’s short stories, mostly around Partition fallout, are terrific stuff…for nightmares.
Anti-Sikh riots: Again, ‘Djinns’ provides a substantial account, while Butalia mentions it along with the Bhagalpur riots. Amitav Ghosh’s ‘Imam and the Indian’ contains ‘The Ghost of Mrs Gandhi’, which, thanks to the narrator, is as vivid as it gets.
 
Ayodhya: The best book-combination for me on this is ‘India after Gandhi’ and Dalrymple’s ‘Age of Kali’. Apart from Guha’s commentary on the Babri build-up and demolition, he cites two events in 1987 that gave rise to a wave of extreme devotion – the immolation of ‘sati’ Roop Kanwar in Rajasthan and the televised avatar of ‘Ramayana’.
 
In parallel, Dalrymple travels to Roop’s village much later, compiling all the versions, of the media, police and villagers – trying to find out if the ‘sati’ was willful or forced. He gets a candid response from a village elder, who says if anyone tried to harm the foreigner Dalrymple, everyone around will jump to his aid. If the villagers felt this way about an unknown guest, did he think Roop’s 60 relatives in the village would let them kill their own daughter? ‘Sati Mata’ is one of many honest, non-judgmental journals by Mr. William.
 
‘Age of Kali’ also dissects the Ayodhya episode, revolving around the author’s first interaction with Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, his mental picture of the saffron leader as a grandmotherly figure, and later, his bewilderment at her lack of sympathy for the minority victims.
 
In 1993, the tremors must have reached all corners of India, but the nation’s 9-year-olds possibly didn’t feel much. Later, we did read ‘Black Friday – The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts’ by S Hussain Zaidi. Did we miss a lot back then? Fifteen years later, we got to see 26/11 live on TV. For 9-year-olds of 2008, there are two books out on the attack you can add to your to-read list – much, much later.
 
The biggest letdown for me has been Jaswant Singh’s book on Jinnah, I couldn’t trudge beyond the first few pages despite desperate attempts (I bought it and it’s expensive). Also, Khushwant Singh’s ‘End of India’ started with a bang and ended with an absurd whimper, in my opinion.
 
In spite of all our (second-hand) experience, we’re still not ready for another communal war. If only all of us could be drilled with the mantra that killing anything around our level at the food chain is a sin, the generations next would be spared the burden of knowing that between being Dr Hannibal Lecter’s lunch or a riots victim – there’s not much of a difference.

25,1617655253-234,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The other reconciliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Citycitybangbang/the-other-reconciliation/,The other reconciliation,"October 10, 2010, 8:40 PM  IST","It seems like India has moved on, is the general consensus. We have seen no violence either before or after the Ayodhya verdict and truth be told, the various prescriptions by different stakeholders to maintain peace have seemed a little unnecessary given the general lack of interest in the subject today. The surprising High Court verdict has created a sense of possibilities in an issue where it seemed that nothing new was imaginable. Of course, the matter is being appealed and we are back to the court again, so materially nothing has changed on the ground.

Has India really moved on? It is easy to say so when it comes to Ayodhya, for as an issue it has moved well beyond its glory days. Nobody has been agitating for a verdict and not many would shed tears if the Supreme Court takes another 18 years to deliver its final verdict. But the distrust between those whose espouse the secular view and those who do not is a deep and growing one and one in which mutual abuse has replaced dialogue as the preferred mode of interaction.

The secular anxiety about those who carry the Hindutva banner, in whatever form, is easy to understand. Both Babri Masjid and Gujarat are good reasons why this should be the case. One has only to scroll down to the comments section of any article on the internet that espouses the secular cause and see the amount of rabid abuse that this worldview attracts. It is difficult to treat this kind of a diatribe as part of any rational discourse, but not everyone on that side of the fence holds such extreme views and tarring anyone who believes that there is a case on the Hindu side with a single brush is a bit extreme. In any case, the implicit certainty that the liberals have in their own belief system too stands on shaky ground.

Take the reaction to this verdict, for starters. Why has the decision to allow both the temple and mosque to come up on the disputed site met with such widespread liberal approval (there is a section which does disapprove of the ‘panchayati verdict and more of that later)? In the build-up to the verdict, when the same people were asked to imagine a solution, hardly anybody would have argued in favour of a temple. There were enough suggestions of an inter-faith structure, a park  or a hospital but few that envisaged the accommodation of a temple at the site. And yet, now that the court has said what it has, why does it seem fair to the same people?

The truth is that the secular minded find it very difficult to acknowledge the legitimacy of any demand couched in terms of religion when it come to the Hindu view but extremely easy to do so when it is framed through other faiths. Part of the reason for the same is the responsibility felt by the majority community to go out of its way to protect the interests of the minority and this is a noble instinct. But it does lead to many instances where the arguments start bordering on the intellectually dishonest and where we can see double standards being blatantly employed. At a fundamental the idea of secularism has come to mean a deep anxiety about anything that smacks of majoritarianism rather than a focus on separating religion from actions of the state. As a result, the secularist often ends up defending that which is not secular in an attempt to provide balance and prevent the majority from overwhelming the less powerful minority. 

Take the case of the Kashmiri Pandits, for instance. Here is another minority group that has visibly been uprooted from their homeland, but the instinct to protect the minority seems strangely lukewarm in this case. For that matter, can we imagine a secular championship of the cause of the Hindu minority in Pakistan? Anyone doing so would be instantly labelled a right wing extremist. The inconsistencies are many; we rail at gender inequality issues but carefully skip those related to the Muslim community. The moral police too gets differential reactions; few defended the lecturer who could not teach in Bengal without a veil and Taslima Nasrin has found it difficult to find refuge even among the Communist-run government. 


There is a strand of opinion that argues that this court verdict is unjust because it sacrifices history for faith. To accept that because Hindus believe this is the site of Lord Rama’s birth it is indeed worthy of being recognised as such, is to open the floodgates on many such ‘imagined’ contentions. In a strictly technical sense, there is merit in this view. But in a larger sense,  isn’t this true of all faiths?  When the Danish cartoon controversy broke out, that too was based on the belief that the Prophet could not be represented in any pictorial form; if that faith-based belief could be respected, why should the verdict be held to another standard? 

The fear of the ‘other’ community is not restricted to Hindus, or any one religious group. Matters of faith create divisions across the world and have always done so. By hardening the lines between those who acknowledge the role of religious identity in our lives and those who don’t, we are creating a climate where dialogue becomes increasingly difficult. The Ayodhya verdict is an excellent opportunity to attempt some sort of a reconciliation not only between the communities but between those who call themselves secularists and those who don’t. 

At the end of day, neither the masjid nor the mandir are meaningful by themselves. Both are symbols of larger ideas- the re-building of the masjid signifies the right that all faiths in India have that in the India of today, no faith can be trampled upon in a fit of majoritarian frenzy and the building of the mandir an acknowledgment of the resentment harboured by a faith for their perceived historical repression. By building both the masjid and the mandir, we have the opportunity of recognising that faith continues to be an important part of our lives, and that we cannot sidestep it by building some other structure, as well as providing some closure to the historical baggage carried by both communities. This would work of course, if this ended all such debates permanently. Build one masjid and one temple and then let us move on for all time to come.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",it seems like india has moved on is the general consensus we have seen no violence either before or after the ayodhya verdict and truth be told the various prescriptions by different stakeholders to maintain peace have seemed a little unnecessary given the general lack of interest in the subject today the surprising high court verdict has created a sense of possibilities in an issue where it seemed that nothing new was imaginable of course the matter is being appealed and we are back to the court again so materially nothing has changed on the groundhas india really moved on it is easy to say so when it comes to ayodhya for as an issue it has moved well beyond its glory days nobody has been agitating for a verdict and not many would shed tears if the supreme court takes another 18 years to deliver its final verdict but the distrust between those whose espouse the secular view and those who do not is a deep and growing one and one in which mutual abuse has replaced dialogue as the preferred mode of interactionthe secular anxiety about those who carry the hindutva banner in whatever form is easy to understand both babri masjid and gujarat are good reasons why this should be the case one has only to scroll down to the comments section of any article on the internet that espouses the secular cause and see the amount of rabid abuse that this worldview attracts it is difficult to treat this kind of a diatribe as part of any rational discourse but not everyone on that side of the fence holds such extreme views and tarring anyone who believes that there is a case on the hindu side with a single brush is a bit extreme in any case the implicit certainty that the liberals have in their own belief system too stands on shaky groundtake the reaction to this verdict for starters why has the decision to allow both the temple and mosque to come up on the disputed site met with such widespread liberal approval there is a section which does disapprove of the panchayati verdict and more of that later in the buildup to the verdict when the same people were asked to imagine a solution hardly anybody would have argued in favour of a temple there were enough suggestions of an interfaith structure a park  or a hospital but few that envisaged the accommodation of a temple at the site and yet now that the court has said what it has why does it seem fair to the same peoplethe truth is that the secular minded find it very difficult to acknowledge the legitimacy of any demand couched in terms of religion when it come to the hindu view but extremely easy to do so when it is framed through other faiths part of the reason for the same is the responsibility felt by the majority community to go out of its way to protect the interests of the minority and this is a noble instinct but it does lead to many instances where the arguments start bordering on the intellectually dishonest and where we can see double standards being blatantly employed at a fundamental the idea of secularism has come to mean a deep anxiety about anything that smacks of majoritarianism rather than a focus on separating religion from actions of the state as a result the secularist often ends up defending that which is not secular in an attempt to provide balance and prevent the majority from overwhelming the less powerful minority take the case of the kashmiri pandits for instance here is another minority group that has visibly been uprooted from their homeland but the instinct to protect the minority seems strangely lukewarm in this case for that matter can we imagine a secular championship of the cause of the hindu minority in pakistan anyone doing so would be instantly labelled a right wing extremist the inconsistencies are many we rail at gender inequality issues but carefully skip those related to the muslim community the moral police too gets differential reactions few defended the lecturer who could not teach in bengal without a veil and taslima nasrin has found it difficult to find refuge even among the communistrun government there is a strand of opinion that argues that this court verdict is unjust because it sacrifices history for faith to accept that because hindus believe this is the site of lord ramas birth it is indeed worthy of being recognised as such is to open the floodgates on many such imagined contentions in a strictly technical sense there is merit in this view but in a larger sense  isnt this true of all faiths  when the danish cartoon controversy broke out that too was based on the belief that the prophet could not be represented in any pictorial form if that faithbased belief could be respected why should the verdict be held to another standard the fear of the other community is not restricted to hindus or any one religious group matters of faith create divisions across the world and have always done so by hardening the lines between those who acknowledge the role of religious identity in our lives and those who dont we are creating a climate where dialogue becomes increasingly difficult the ayodhya verdict is an excellent opportunity to attempt some sort of a reconciliation not only between the communities but between those who call themselves secularists and those who dont at the end of day neither the masjid nor the mandir are meaningful by themselves both are symbols of larger ideas the rebuilding of the masjid signifies the right that all faiths in india have that in the india of today no faith can be trampled upon in a fit of majoritarian frenzy and the building of the mandir an acknowledgment of the resentment harboured by a faith for their perceived historical repression by building both the masjid and the mandir we have the opportunity of recognising that faith continues to be an important part of our lives and that we cannot sidestep it by building some other structure as well as providing some closure to the historical baggage carried by both communities this would work of course if this ended all such debates permanently build one masjid and one temple and then let us move on for all time

26,1617655353-260,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Calls for Ayodhya temple law mean it’s Ram bharose again in 2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/academic-interest/calls-for-ayodhya-temple-law-mean-its-ram-bharose-again-in-2019/,Calls for Ayodhya temple law mean it’s Ram bharose again in 2019,"November 4, 2018, 11:16 AM  IST","The growing clamour for a law to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya is reminiscent of Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr’s 1849 satirical aphorism: “The more things change, the more they remain the same.” The carefully constructed public symphony we have seen in recent days on the possibility of an overriding law to build a Ram temple means that as we head into election season in 2019, our politics is galloping back to the future in a deja-vu rerun of the halcyon days of the Ayodhya movement in the early 1990s.
The clarion call was first sounded by RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat in his Vijay Dashami speech on October 18 when he asked the Modi government to “expedite the decision regarding the ownership of Ram Janmabhoomi” and to clear the path for the construction of a temple “through appropriate and requisite law”. Bhagwat was drawing a line in the sand, as if almost anticipating the Supreme Court’s decision on October 29 to defer a call on hearing dates on the matter to an “appropriate bench” in the first week of January 2019.
The BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha then raised the pitch, announcing a “private member’s bill” in Parliament for a Ram temple, along with an emotive political dare to Rahul Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury, Lalu Yadav and Mayawati to oppose the idea. Then came the carefully calibrated statement by RSS sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, asking the Supreme Court to “rethink the matter” of the Ram temple as Hindus were feeling “insulted” that it was not on its “priority list”. As he put it: “Society should respect the court and the court should also respect society and its sentiments.” The RSS has put the ball firmly in the Modi government’s court, making it clear that it favours a Ram temple ordinance “if all other options run out”.
So, what does all this amount to? First, on legislation: BJP has a brute majority in the Lok Sabha but simply doesn’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to push such a law through. That is why a private member’s bill (legislation introduced in Parliament by any individual MP who is officially not acting on behalf of the government) has been mooted. Of course, the last time a private member’s bill became a law was in 1970.
The beauty of this stratagem is that it allows for a great deal of posturing. It raises the emotional pitch and political temperature on the Ram temple as we head into 2019, allowing BJP to ask the simple reductionist question: who is for Ram, and who is against?
For a party that has sworn by the Ram temple as an article of faith for almost three decades now — including in its 2014 manifesto where it promised to “explore all possibilities within the framework of the Constitution” to facilitate its construction — the inability to move on it despite the majority it has enjoyed in Parliament since 2014 is politically problematic when faced with its core ideological constituency.
While BJP spokespersons have been careful in their responses to the private member’s bill, reiterating their commitment to building the Ram temple within the constitutional framework, they have also made pointed allusions to the 1989 Palampur resolution when the BJP first formally committed itself to the Ayodhya project.
The relevant text of the Palampur resolution, passed by BJP’s national executive in June 1989, bears repeating: “The BJP holds that the nature of the (Ayodhya) controversy is such that it just cannot be sorted out by a court of law…. The BJP calls upon the Rajiv Gandhi government to adopt the same positive approach in respect of Ayodhya that the Nehru government did with respect to Somnath. The sentiments of the people must be respected, and Ram Janmasthan handed over to the Hindus — if possible through a negotiated settlement, or else by legislation. Litigation certainly is no answer.”
It is in this context that we must see BJP president Amit Shah’s clear line on Sabarimala that his party “stands like a rock” with devotees opposing Supreme Court’s verdict on the entry of women and that government and courts should “issue orders that can be implemented”, not those that “break the faith of people.”
Let us be clear: Sabarimala is also a cipher for Ayodhya. The same logic on the primacy of faith as a fundamental right that works for the south Indian shrine, works for Ayodhya too.
If legislation fails, the temptation may be for a Ram temple ordinance — in a variation of what Rajiv Gandhi did to overturn SC’s verdict in the Shah Bano case — even if that route would be legally challenged.
Either way, the debate would firmly resurrect religiosity in politics, resetting the political chessboard. At a time when the government is facing questions on multiple fronts, it’s back to Ram as the dominant narrative for 2019.

temple means that as we head into election season in 2019 our politics is galloping back to the future in a dejavu rerun of the halcyon days of the ayodhya movement in the early 1990sthe clarion call was first sounded by rss sarsanghchalak mohan bhagwat in his vijay dashami speech on october 18 when he asked the modi government to expedite the decision regarding the ownership of ram janmabhoomi and to clear the path for the construction of a temple through appropriate and requisite law bhagwat was drawing a line in the sand as if almost anticipating the supreme courts decision on october 29 to defer a call on hearing dates on the matter to an appropriate bench in the first week of january 2019the bjps rajya sabha mp rakesh sinha then raised the pitch announcing a private members bill in parliament for a ram temple along with an emotive political dare to rahul gandhi sitaram yechury lalu yadav and mayawati to oppose the idea then came the carefully calibrated statement by rss sarkaryavah bhaiyyaji joshi asking the supreme court to rethink the matter of the ram temple as hindus were feeling insulted that it was not on its priority list as he put it society should respect the court and the court should also respect society and its sentiments the rss has put the ball firmly in the modi governments court making it clear that it favours a ram temple ordinance if all other options run outso what does all this amount to first on legislation bjp has a brute majority in the lok sabha but simply doesnt have the numbers in rajya sabha to push such a law through that is why a private members bill legislation introduced in parliament by any individual mp who is officially not acting on behalf of the government has been mooted of course the last time a private members bill became a law was in 1970the beauty of this stratagem is that it allows for a great deal of posturing it raises the emotional pitch and political temperature on the ram temple as we head into 2019 allowing bjp to ask the simple reductionist question who is for ram and who is againstfor a party that has sworn by the ram temple as an article of faith for almost three decades now — including in its 2014 manifesto where it promised to explore all possibilities within the framework of the constitution to facilitate its construction — the inability to move on it despite the majority it has enjoyed in parliament since 2014 is politically problematic when faced with its core ideological constituencywhile bjp spokespersons have been careful in their responses to the private members bill reiterating their commitment to building the ram temple within the constitutional framework they have also made pointed allusions to the 1989 palampur resolution when the bjp first formally committed itself to the ayodhya projectthe relevant text of the palampur resolution passed by bjps national executive in june 1989 bears repeating the bjp holds that the nature of the ayodhya controversy is such that it just cannot be sorted out by a court of law… the bjp calls upon the rajiv gandhi government to adopt the same positive approach in respect of ayodhya that the nehru government did with respect to somnath the sentiments of the people must be respected and ram janmasthan handed over to the hindus — if possible through a negotiated settlement or else by legislation litigation certainly is no answerit is in this context that we must see bjp president amit shahs clear line on sabarimala that his party stands like a rock with devotees opposing supreme courts verdict on the entry of women and that government and courts should issue orders that can be implemented not those that break the faith of peoplelet us be clear sabarimala is also a cipher for ayodhya the same logic on the primacy of faith as a fundamental right that works for the south indian shrine works for ayodhya tooif legislation fails the temptation may be for a ram temple ordinance — in a variation of what rajiv gandhi did to overturn scs verdict in the shah bano case — even if that route would be legally challengedeither way the debate would firmly resurrect religiosity in politics resetting the political chessboard at a time when the government is facing questions on multiple fronts its back to ram as the dominant narrative for 2019

The government’s chief economist says India will soon overtake China as the world’s fastest growing economy. So it would, concurs a Morgan Stanley study, based on the expected demographic dividend as the share of the non-working, dependent population shrinks, boosting not only the share of active workers but also the savings required to finance massive investment. Foreign direct investment inflows of the magnitude that the world envied China for, for much of the last couple of decades, is now flowing into India. Indians themselves are aggressive outward investors, and investment promotion outfits of most advanced countries woo Indian capital. 
   The president of the United States warns his country’s children that if they don’t study hard, Indian children will eat their jobs. Indian enterprise is respected, even feared, as being capable of devouring good, middle-American jobs, if business process outsourcing is not curbed. 
   Indian managers are making their mark around the world. Indra Nooyi, Vikram Pandit and Anshu Jain have steered their ships with great elan over the choppy waters of the financial and economic crisis, to the far shore of greater profitability. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s views are received with respect and attention, when leaders of the world meet, to discuss globally coordinated solutions to global problems. 
   Yes, on most counts, India would indeed seem to be getting ready to play. So it would seem appropriate that India should host a major sporting event like the Commonwealth Games. However, the manner in which we went about organising them, producing a sordid tale of incompetence, corruption and shoddiness that has been unfolding in daily installments to public shock and horror, has made us hang our heads in shame. 
   But this is not all. The nation was on edge on September 30th, when a high court delivered its verdict on a disputed shrine at Ayodhya. The police forces were on full alert in all parts of the country. Several states had issued prohibitory orders, closed schools and colleges, in anticipation of violence that is no less menacing for its eventual non-occurrence. Should a nation about to take wing be cringing at its own reflection morphed through a prism of anger? The insurgencies in Kashmir and the north-east and by the Maoists, the concept of honour that impels father and brother to kill daughter and sister, the skewed distribution o social power that makes Dalits easy prey to the greed and lust of upper caste miscreant, the custom and mores that make even the Capital’s Metro provide exclusive compartments for women and, every so often, send a doctor off to jail for conducting pre-natal sex determination tests, what do all these tell us about the state of the Union? If this is preparation for play, what macabre sport are we preparing for? 
Yes, there is ugliness in our midst that the opening ceremony spectacle or Shera, the Games mascot’s smile or the colourful screens planted strategically all along the route the foreign athletes would travel cannot conceal. But India is not just chaos and dirt and violence. If there is one thing that suffuses India’s collective consciousness today as never before, it is hope — hope that things would improve, drastically, and for everyone. Without hope for the future, there can be neither joy in the present, nor creative action. But there is, indeed, hope, and joy, and plenty of action. India is indeed prepared to play. Let the games play on!

At the heart of it was India’s wellness guru, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who on March 6, 2018 had written to the President and the Members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), explaining the current situation and future possibilities for India in the context of the long-pending dispute. The genial guru explained in the letter that he had examined the possible outcomes of the Supreme Court judgment favouring one community over the other. In the second paragraph of the letter, Sri Sri wrote: “The first possibility is that of the court declaring the site be given to the Hindus based on the archaeological evidence that the temple existed long before the masjid. In this scenario, Muslims would have serious apprehensions about our legal system and their faith in the Indian judiciary may be shaken.”
And then he further wrote: “Even though the Muslim Personal Law Board and other community leaders say that they will accept it, in the long run, the feeling that the court has done injustice to the community will prevail for centuries.”
What is interesting is that statements from the Muslim leadership after the Ayodhya verdict vindicated Sri Sri’s stand on the Ayodhya issue.
“The order was not based on merit and evidence and defied logic … Justice was not done fully in this judgment,” said Maulana Arshad Madani, President, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) & Executive Member, AIMPLB “The judgement has shaken the faith of the minorities in the judiciary as they believe that they have been wronged,” said Maulana Mahmood Madani, General Secretary, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) & Executive Member, AIMPLB. And then, said Dr Muhammad Salim Engineer, Vice President, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH): “The representatives of JIH attended the meeting (with NSA Ajit Doval) only to convey our disagreement and dissatisfaction with the judgment and the course of events.”  And then spoke Asaduddin Owaisi, President, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) & Executive Member, AIMPLB, who had once said he will accept whatever verdict comes from the Supreme Court. Hours after the judgement, Owaisi said: The Supreme Court is supreme but not infallible.”
So let’s reconstruct the events to see – obviously with a magnifying glass – Sri Sri’s involvement with the long-standing Ayodhya dispute. Well, it began in 2001. Sri Sri had returned to India, after addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2001, and had a meeting with the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Very few know it was Vajpayee who requested Sri Sri to help resolve the dispute through an out-of-court settlement. Consequently, Sri Sri held a series of meetings with stakeholders from the Hindu and Muslim communities between September 2001 and March 2002.
Eventually, Sri Sri proposed a 3-point formula in February 2003. He met with senior-most functionaries of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and also visited the AIMPLB office in Delhi for a meeting with about 15 members. Almost everyone from both sides had agreed to Sri Sri’s formula. Sri Sri explained why communal harmony in India is a role model for the world and why India is the original melting pot of cultures. The wellness guru explained time and again how Indians accommodated others and adapted beliefs based on the ancient idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or One World Family. However, the talks reached a dead end due the hard-nosed and dogmatic attitude of only a few. Even before his appointment to the 3-member mediation panel, set up by the Supreme Court, the same set of people were opposing Sri Sri’s 2017 initiative.
But let’s take a realistic look. The solution Sri Sri had offered since 2003 to resolve the Ayodhya dispute proved to be right, the same solution has been now been promulgated by the country’s apex court. Had Sri Sri’s advice been heeded by both sides India could have saved 16 precious years.
India is the beacon of hope for our planet, a planet that often finds itself in the midst of gory conflict. The mediation process that Sri Sri kick-started in 2003, and that which has culminated with the balanced and historic judgement of the Supreme Court has brought forth the real strength of our culture and values to the world.
India has often shown that it is only through the unifying and higher spiritual knowledge of the ancients, that which is available in all cultures and religions, harmonious co-existence is possible. It is precisely this very message Sri Sri had put forward in his meetings to resolve the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid crisis. The message routinely reflects in the teaching and actions of the spiritual and wellness guru, counted among the world’s top peace ambassadors.
The faster people listen and agree, its better for mankind.

     I have a lot of respect for Sri Sri, but I couldn't figure out why gets the credit for Ayodhya settlement. It is a purely judicial verdict. I think the writer of the blog is a member of Sri Sri's Art of Living Foundation....  Read More

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",the dust has – for all practical purpose – settled on the ram janmabhoomi – babri masjid dispute and its time for some introspection especially taking a look at those who worked overtime to defuse the crisisat the heart of it was indias wellness guru sri sri ravi shankar who on march 6 2018 had written to the president and the members of the all india muslim personal law board aimplb explaining the current situation and future possibilities for india in the context of the longpending dispute the genial guru explained in the letter that he had examined the possible outcomes of the supreme court judgment favouring one community over the other in the second paragraph of the letter sri sri wrote the first possibility is that of the court declaring the site be given to the hindus based on the archaeological evidence that the temple existed long before the masjid in this scenario muslims would have serious apprehensions about our legal system and their faith in the indian judiciary may be shakenand then he further wrote even though the muslim personal law board and other community leaders say that they will accept it in the long run the feeling that the court has done injustice to the community will prevail for centurieswhat is interesting is that statements from the muslim leadership after the ayodhya verdict vindicated sri sris stand on the ayodhya issuethe order was not based on merit and evidence and defied logic … justice was not done fully in this judgment said maulana arshad madani president jamiat ulamaihind juh  executive member aimplb the judgement has shaken the faith of the minorities in the judiciary as they believe that they have been wronged said maulana mahmood madani general secretary jamiat ulamaihind juh  executive member aimplb and then said dr muhammad salim engineer vice president jamaateislami hind jih the representatives of jih attended the meeting with nsa ajit doval only to convey our disagreement and dissatisfaction with the judgment and the course of events  and then spoke asaduddin owaisi president all india majliseittehadul muslimeen aimim  executive member aimplb who had once said he will accept whatever verdict comes from the supreme court hours after the judgement owaisi said the supreme court is supreme but not infallibleso lets reconstruct the events to see – obviously with a magnifying glass – sri sris involvement with the longstanding ayodhya dispute well it began in 2001 sri sri had returned to india after addressing the world economic forum wef in 2001 and had a meeting with the then pm atal bihari vajpayee very few know it was vajpayee who requested sri sri to help resolve the dispute through an outofcourt settlement consequently sri sri held a series of meetings with stakeholders from the hindu and muslim communities between september 2001 and march 2002eventually sri sri proposed a 3point formula in february 2003 he met with seniormost functionaries of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp and also visited the aimplb office in delhi for a meeting with about 15 members almost everyone from both sides had agreed to sri sris formula sri sri explained why communal harmony in india is a role model for the world and why india is the original melting pot of cultures the wellness guru explained time and again how indians accommodated others and adapted beliefs based on the ancient idea of vasudhaiva kutumbakam or one world family however the talks reached a dead end due the hardnosed and dogmatic attitude of only a few even before his appointment to the 3member mediation panel set up by the supreme court the same set of people were opposing sri sris 2017 initiativebut lets take a realistic

This is to,
My schoolmates.
My school is 107 years old and it has a large tree.
Mango or banyan, we never cared.
Exactly the same way as we never cared who was a Muslim amongst us and who was from the general caste.
That tree never fell…
for my school & mates.
Where we learnt, imbibed and inculcated a few words in spirit.
Words like republic, democracy, secularism, inclusiveness.
Where we learnt the extraordinary lessons of our ordinary lives.
Lessons like United we stand – Divided we fall.
I am told that these lessons are best suited to the pages of Moral Science, today.
Is it?
The Ayodhya verdict made me sit up and take notice of this. To whom does it matter, I asked myself. Does the upper-class Indian believe in Ram or Rahim? They believe in Lakshmi, they hardly visit public places in India especially places of worship like Ayodhya and they stay away from controversies. Does the middle class Indian find the time, from his daily grind, to passionately follow a dispute for 27 years? They are a sandwiched lot who keep playing snakes and ladders – striving for upgrading their class while being pulled in by the fear of being degraded. Does the lower class Indian even think? They have a hand to mouth existence, they can switch anything for monies including gods and political parties and they couldn’t-care-less, given their miserable lives.
The question still stands. To whom do the temple and the mosque matter? To those who are fanatics or those in the business of creating or nurturing fanatics?
By the way, do you know the washermen? The washermen are a class of Indians who make their living by washing the, supposedly, dirty linen in public (idiom intended). They are not from any religion, community, party or country. They are faithless (pun intended) but they belong to all three classes. Not the aforesaid classes but the other three called – “I, Me and Myself”. For them, service to God is service to themselves. Yes, this divide matters to the washermen. What matters to a regular Indian is a peaceful existence. An existence free from the strife, which exists since India achieved independence. But then, did we actually achieve it? Are we independent of caste, creed, colour? Sorry Charlie, independence is not about borders and swaraj. Independence is a state of mind.
You can not hear a fish in a fish market but you can hear the patients in a hospital. That’s Life. Social Media only mirrors it. I am that fish in the fish market of rabble-rousers. The rabble-rousers are also the, supposed, patients in the hospital called India. I can play the victim card, I can play the religion card, I can play the language card, I can fake my achievements, I can seek attention by all this and more but I will not. I know dignity sucks but then that is the only way I know. So, as far as I am concerned, I relate my country and the Ayodhya verdict to my school, to my schoolmates.
My schoolmates are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs etc originating from China, Nepal, India, England, Pakistan, etc living in UK, US, Australia, India, Africa,
Germany etc being a Jharkhandi, a Kashmiri, Malayali, Bihari, Marathi, Bengali, Rajasthani, Punjabi, Tamilian, Andhraite, a UPite etc and further Brahmins, Shias, Sunnis, Kshatriyas, Vaishya, Catholic, Protestant, Sikhs etc. but…
We remained Indians, first.
We remain mates. We learnt it from that tree.
That tree has hundreds of branches but one root.
Those branches which did not differentiate between caste, creed or colour.
The crown which accommodated an owl as well as a sparrow.
Yonder leaves which maintained O2 for everyone, equally.
Many moons ago, those branches-crown-leaves dispersed to find their own skies and meet only once in a blue moon.
I love them for still being there like the single malt – shoving, smiling, maturing, engulfing, intoxicating, malicious, invigorating etc. but..
still being THERE.
With WhatsApp, Facebook, Pride And Prejudice etc. but..
with a belonging that we share our past, which can never change etc and that…
United we stand – Divided we fall.
That tree never fail..ed
That tree never fell…
for the majority from a minority convent school.
That tree is my India.
That tree is your India.
Jai Hind!

The name “Ram” rolls easily off the tongue, whichever corner of India you come from, whichever Indian language your mother taught you. Although Rama and Krishna are the best-known gods in human form in our mythology, Rama is recognized across swathes of South-east Asia.  I have watched Ramayana ballets on Bali island, wayang shadow puppet shows on Rama’s life on Java island, and admired the Ramayana bas reliefs at Angkor Wat.
In December 1995, Cambodia marked the end of decades of war and destruction with an International Ramayana Festival at Angkor Wat.  More than 300 dancers, musicians and puppeteers from across Asia gathered in the ancient temple complex to celebrate Rama’s life.  The Ramakien (Glory of Rama) is Thailand’s official epic; it was retrieved from the ruins of Ayutthaya on the Chao Phraya river and restored with royal patronage. Although Thailand is a Buddhist nation, the Ramayana still exerts much influence on its art and culture.
Both Rama and Krishna were blue-blooded and lived, loved and fought in locations we can still identify in our modern geography. Their parentages, their families and playmates, their allies and foes, are familiar to even the unlettered among us.

Nina Paley, 2008
But unlike the supreme Hindu triumvirate of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, who descended to earth occasionally to fix the cosmic order (and who are enshrined at Prambanan near Yogyakarta in Indonesia), Rama lived a human existence we can easily comprehend in its trials, tribulations, and outcomes.
Like millions of my compatriots, I have been touched by the story of the handsome young warrior prince, banished to 14 years of exile in the forests by an avaricious stepmother. His wife Sita is abducted; he and his brother Lakshmana battle adversities; the prince fights and kills the demon ruler Ravana of Lanka; his wife is freed from captivity; and the noble victors with their loyal followers return triumphantly to reclaim the throne of Ayodhya. Rama’s reign – Rama Rajya – is happy, prosperous, and virtuous.
Like it has been told and re-told over the centuries, this tale etched itself in my imagination through oral tradition – the 56 songs of the Geet Ramayan, the Marathi ballad written by G.D. Madgulkar and first sung by Sudhir Phadke over All India Radio in 1955-56.
But the ballad itself is based on the maha-kavya or great poem composed by the sage Valmiki about 2,500 years ago. This is where it gets interesting. The Valmiki Ramayana has been adapted and re-told over the centuries, for instance by Tulsidas, Kalidasa and Kamban.  The most recent interpretation is Bibek Debroy’s 2018 three-volume translation.  Valmiki’s poetry focused entirely on Rama.  However beautiful the 25,000 shlokas or stanzas (and they can be enjoyed only in their original Sanskrit), the written version itself took shape centuries after Valmiki’s composition was transmitted through generations of balladeers.  The latter of the seven kandas or cantos may themselves have been embellished by later story-tellers.
What I find fascinating is Rama’s personality: well-intentioned, principled and yet gullible.  He is revered as the Maryada Purushottama, the ultimate exemplar of virtue and respect, a mortal who tried to adhere to dharma or righteousness, whatever the price he had to pay.  Here, too, scholars make clear we have Rama’s story, an individual’s life journey, warts and all. “On that exile to the forest, why did he take Sita and Lakshmana along with him? Was Shurpanakha’s disfigurement warranted? Why did he unfairly kill Vali? Why did he make Sita go through tests of purity, not once, but twice? Why did he unfairly kill Shambuka? Why did he banish Lakshmana?” Debroy writes.
From my readings, it appears Valmiki’s Ramayana itself was sung to Rama in his court by his twin sons Kusha and Lava, who were born and brought up at the sage’s ashram during Sita’s own banishment by her doubting husband.  The tale goes that Rama did not recognise his sons. Was their recitation poetic justice?
In a thoughtful essay, Devdutt Pattanaik analyses the Rama narrative. It creates the framework, he writes, “to explain key social concepts such as kinship, fidelity, property and self-image, which is why it is retold constantly, each retelling focussing on a particular theme or point of view”.  British colonial translations of multilingual Rama stories into English, casting them in historical terms, upset Hindus who believed in their faith’s timelessness.  And then American scholars’ secularisation of the Ramayana, stripping it of religious significance, viewing it in caste and gender terms, and presenting Rama as a “not quite ideal man or God … This riled the nationalists and religious fundamentalists who saw such intellectual analyses as a violation of their sacred narratives, and an attempt to undermine all things Hindu.”
For centuries, dozens of Hindu dynasties, like the Thai kings, adopted the Ramayana as their user manual or combination symbol-proxy-totem.  Rama’s deification began to formalise around 500 CE at the Vishnu shrine at Deogarh in Uttar Pradesh, which contains eight Ramayana panels (Rama is considered one of Vishnu’s avatars). There was a burst of Rama temple construction over two centuries from around 1125 CE, when two temples were built in Raigarh district in Chhatisgarh.
But it is the much-anticipated temple at Rama’s putative birthplace in Ayodhya that preoccupies our politicians nine centuries later. The Supreme Court’s verdict on the 2.77-acre piece of land will most likely be delivered next fortnight, just before Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi ends his term. Rama walked away from his whole kingdom. Which side will follow his example? Hey Ram!

     Great Piece Chatanaya saheb. In the early 1990s when a military operation was underway in port city Karachi and adjacent city Hyderabad  I was roamiing in the streets of my city during nights fearlessly. I vividly remember that when I went to my psychiatrist friend Prof. S. Haroon Ahmed he asked: ""You are God?"" I kept quiet but thought: ""I am a writer. I create."" I have read ""A History of God"" by Karen Armstrong"" but I think I am beyond mythology and religion. I draw my strength from Mother Nature that is 3 billion-year-old. My second book ""Muft Lay Lo Khawab"" (Take Away my Dreams for Free) based on my memoirs will be launched on Friday November 8 at Karachi Press Club at 4pm. I have written everything truthfully. I am also working on my hypothesis, ""Relationship between Nature and Homosapiens"" and hope to write a 100-pages book based on my hypothesis. My hypothesis has been approved by three eminent scientists and educationists including my psychiatrist friend Prof. S. Haroon Ahmed, Dr. Kaneez Fatima-Shad, professor of molecular medicine and Terrance Taylor, president World Life Sciences, Council, USA. I wish I could travel to India. I will send you my book when it is printed....  Read More

This is certainly an odd argument that needs to be reviewed, particularly because it pertains to Babri Masjid which was demolished by Hindutva activists, and may have played a role in influencing the Allahabad high court’s three judge verdict in 2010 reducing Muslim parties’ claim to merely one-third of the land on which Babri Masjid stood.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan has argued that the notion that mosques are not essential to Islam is an “unsupported assertion” made without referring to Islamic scriptures. He wanted it revisited by a larger constitutional bench first, a justified demand given that sanctity of places of worship ought not to be overruled easily in a secular republic. As Justice Bharucha observed in the minority judgment in the Ismail Faruqui case, the acquisition of land around Babri Masjid citing public order was impermissible under constitutional tenet of secularism as adherents of the majority religion used force of numbers to assail the place of worship and disrupt public order.
Whichever way the arguments in court go, both the Centre and UP government must maintain a scrupulously neutral and non-partisan stance in the dispute, as well as be seen to be doing so. The state has a duty to represent all of its citizens, not just some; India has already seen too much social, political and religious polarisation. Else the BJslogan of “sab ka saath, sab ka vikas” will ring hollow; among other things, it will have little locus standi left to push a Uniform Civil Code, a cause that we support.

     If you suggest going back a few years, why not go back a few more years and recover all the land of India that has been usurped as waqf property? The government should make a serious effort of rebuilding all the temples that were destroyed by the Muslim rulers especially those on which mosques were built. Sabka saath sabka vikas also means that the government should be concerned about the vikas and sentiments of the majority community. While the courts can make the final decision, the government must prepare a strong case for rebuilding the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi. All archeological information must be presented (not the one that was forged by the Ghandy, not Gandhi, Congress and its clones). Everybody who has been to Ram Janmabhoomi knows that there was a temple there on which a mosque was built. People like Dhawan and Sibal are the worst kind of Jaichands and Mir Zafars India has produced. A firm handling of the Ram Janmabhoomi case would go a long way in unifying India including removing any misgivings of the Muslims and pave the way for a Uniform Civil Code. Contrary to what this editorial says, any attempt to soft pedal that issue will continue to divide the communities in India along religious lines....  Read More

With the  Supreme Court beginning day to day hearings in the matter this is likely to be the big judgment that Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi will pronounce before he demits office. Unlike his predecessor Dipak Misra who was part of benches that delivered a series of big ticket judgments before retirement CJI Gogoi has focused on improving the administrative side training his guns on the poor disposal of cases, especially in POCSO offences.
The Allahabad high court judgment dividing the disputed land three ways between the Nirmohi Akhara, Ram Lalla, and Sunni Wakf Board didn’t find acceptance among any of the litigants and this will bear heavily on the mind of the five judges hearing the dispute. The preference for mediation indicates that we could see another judgment which tries a win-win approach for all stakeholders. A number of such compromise solutions like building a temple and mosque side by side, building a national memorial for communal harmony at the disputed site, and the proposal by Sangh Parivar groups to build the temple at the disputed site and a mosque across the Sarayu river, are on the table.

The court’s current search for historical title deeds or possession documents may not yield much. What is not in dispute is that the Hindu and Muslim side had petitioned the British courts on their claims to the site from the 19th century. It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court decision will settle the dispute that for Hindu believers is more about faith than legality and for the Muslim side is about both.
Ultimately, like the Sabarimala dispute where the Supreme Court judgment proved incapable of being executed in the face of strident protests, the verdict here could also be unpalatable for both sides. In that case, the governments of UP and Centre will come into the picture. It could then fall to the trio of PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and UP CM Yogi Adityanath to find a political solution out of the impasse. With the force of ideology and the strength of parliamentary numbers behind them, the denouement  in another dispute that has vexed Independent India’s history for over three decades will perhaps be welcomed with open arms by a “majority” of the people.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",the government is in the mood to settle long pending issues and it appears to be rubbing off on the supreme court too at least in the babri masjidramjanmabhoomi title dispute case with the  supreme court beginning day to day hearings in the matter this is likely to be the big judgment that chief justice of india ranjan gogoi will pronounce before he demits office unlike his predecessor dipak misra who was part of benches that delivered a series of big ticket judgments before retirement cji gogoi has focused on improving the administrative side training his guns on the poor disposal of cases especially in pocso offencesthe allahabad high court judgment dividing the disputed land three ways between the nirmohi akhara ram lalla and sunni wakf board didnt find acceptance among any of the litigants and this will bear heavily on the mind of the five judges hearing the dispute the preference for mediation indicates that we could see another judgment which tries a winwin approach for all stakeholders a number of such compromise solutions like building a temple and mosque side by side building a national memorial for communal harmony at the disputed site and the proposal by sangh parivar groups to build the temple at the disputed site and a mosque across the sarayu river are on the tablethe courts current search for historical title deeds or possession documents may not yield much what is not in dispute is that the hindu and muslim side had petitioned the british courts on their claims to the site from the 19th century it remains to be seen whether the supreme court decision will settle the dispute that for hindu believers is more about faith than legality and for the muslim side is about bothultimately like the sabarimala dispute where the supreme court judgment proved incapable of being executed in the face of strident protests the verdict here could also be unpalatable for both sides in that case the governments of up and centre will come into the picture it could then fall to the trio of pm narendra modi home minister amit shah and up cm yogi adityanath to find a political solution out of the impasse with the force of ideology and the strength of parliamentary numbers behind them the denouement  in another dispute that has vexed independent indias history for

Sorry for bringing gender into a crucial judgment, but this question must be asked. Do we not have a single ‘ladyship’ worthy enough? Five learned lordships have done what they were mandated to do — end a 200-year-old dispute. It was perhaps the toughest case in India’s contemporary history, after the devastating, heartbreakingly tragic consequences of the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. India has never been the same again. Now comes the judgment that, in all fairness to the eminent judges, will be debated for decades to come.

Had there been a female representation arguing and discussing the complexities of this extraordinary case, would the verdict have been any different? Perhaps. Perhaps not. I guess, now that it’s a fait accompli, there is no point in speculation. Even so, future historians are likely to deconstruct and reconstruct, dissect and argue over what will undoubtedly lead to yet another rejigging of our collective consciousness. And why not? Nothing remains static. Change has its consequences. Deal with it…
As of now, most citizens are plain bewildered. This is not a simple land dispute. And we know it. Ayodhya has connotations that go way beyond title deeds and ownership issues. How many of us knew the exact meaning of the word ‘Shebait’? I certainly didn’t. Well, this is what a dictionary says, “A shebait is that person who serves the deity consecrated in the temple as a devata.” Another puts it more succinctly: “A shebait is an agent of the idol.” So much for that. Their lordships shot down this claim stating the Nirmohi Akhara’s suit is ‘barred by limitations’ adding ‘they are not shebaits for worship of Lord Ram and the Ram Mandir.” So much for that. But hey, the disputed site has been given to the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas. Okay? The Sunni Waqf Board has been granted five acres of land at a suitable site. Hmmmmm. We remain baffled!
In the parallel world of Mumbai, this long-awaited resolution to a troubling conundrum barely registered. Well-meaning friends from distant cities kept sending warnings and messages, advising parents to keep their kids at home, avoid crowded locations, and generally stay put. “There could be rioting on the streets,” warned a relative, while life on our crowded, potholed roads carried on without missing a beat. People were busy making weekend plans — brunches and movies won over Ayodhya and Babri Masjid. Don’t get me wrong. This is not a reflection of indifference or apathy. This is Mumbai at its most pragmatic. Ayodhya is miles away. Our city and state are headless as of now. Onion prices have soared to Rs 100 per kilo. But how will we cope, huh? Ayodhya can take care of itself.
Can it? Will it? What about all those festering wounds? Is the judgment a salve … or more salt? Forget Mumbai, what about over-burdened citizens across the rest of the country? How many were holding their breaths and praying for a judgment that would go ‘in their ‘favour’? Who decides and defines ‘favour’? Emotive issues do not understand logic, reason or even what’s ‘fair”. The word ‘fair’ itself is loaded and open to interpretation. Their lordships have done a stupendous and very difficult job – one that will define their individual legacies. They have stuck their necks out and placed their heads on the chopping block of public judgement. Always a risky business which involves large reserves of moral courage. We respect them immensely for taking on one of the worst legal battles on earth. They did it! And did it to the best of their ability. Alas, lordships are as human as you and me. We don’t possess their erudition or wisdom. But we all have our hearts and minds which raise painful questions and desperately seek answers.
So, bhaiyon aur behenon…and mainly, Mitron…the judgment is here. The only way to move from this point on, is forward. Mandir ho, ya masjid.  The Ayodhya matter has been ‘settled’. Let us go on with the tricky business of living the best we can. With optimism and hope. Nobody can stamp on our longings, and our yearnings for a secure future — nobody. Not even the learned lordships. We own our lives, and we own our dreams. Kaafi hai. And please, next time we constitute a bench for something as significant as the Ayodhya verdict, let’s get women on board. The outcome is bound to amaze!

     very expectably uninformed Shoba de - one of the few members of the weaker sex in India. Most Indian women are of the strong other sex but Shoba has to bring in sexism totally forgetting the Sabarimala judgment was made by a  woman and she stood with the culture so no We don't look down upon woman. Only we look down upon retrds like SHoba...  Read More

They must be included in the new India,"November 14, 2019, 9:20 AM  IST","Ayodhya: Mohammad Naeemul Haq’s home and wood-chipping business is on the edge of the boundary wall that overlooks the site where the 450-year-old Babri Masjid once stood and where the Ram Janmaboomi temple will now be built after the sanction of India’s Supreme Court. He has had a ringside view of Ayodhya’s changing skyline and will see what comes up in the future too.   
He was eight years old when the Babri Masjid was demolished. The night before December 6, 1992, he was sent out of Ayodhya while his father stayed to guard home and hearth. After the demolition of the mosque, his father hid when the mob came to burn down the home and office.  He survived those days to literally resurrect life from the ashes. The rioters were creative about destruction and demolition: the shards of wood were stuffed into the room that made up the office and it was set afire. The room exploded like a bomb. The family never repaired that room and the blackened bricks are signs of the hate that passed over Ayodhya. It stands as a reminder of the past.   
They can never forget but they want to move on. Haq will watch the mandir come up but he wants peace and would like no reviews to be filed against the Supreme Court verdict. The large Muslim community across India’s most populous state know they have no agency to protest and just want to get on with their lives.   
No, they do not feel that real justice has been delivered. For in the end the perpetrators of India’s most public crime (the demolition of the Babri mosque) have got what they wanted. But people do hope that the worst has passed and will not be dug up again. There is disquiet too at the Supreme Court giving importance to faith in deciding what was essentially a land title dispute. Yet people want to look ahead.

How do we as a nation do so and can this mark a moment of national reconciliation? First, we have not really reached the end of Ayodhya cases. Since the land dispute has gone in a particular way, it’s even more important for the criminal cases against the men and women charged with destroying the mosque to be concluded.  
The Supreme Court has in the November 9 ruling described the destruction of the Babri mosque as an “egregious violation of the rule of law”. Can we now see the same haste in the matter of punishing the accused as we have seen in the land case? Constitutional and political morality demands that. There is now an urgent need to mete out punishment to avoid setting a precedent that allows people to get away with wanton criminal acts on the grounds of faith.   
Second, there could be a silver lining for the nation’s largest minority in the fact that the ruling political class now says that the matter is settled. The truth is that Muslims were always between a rock and a hard place on Ayodhya. The Ram temple movement was the springboard for BJP’s momentum in national politics and merged quite seamlessly with genuine faith in Lord Ram.   
It had always been a lose-lose situation for the minority community, damned if they win, damned if they don’t. It was the temple issue that most effectively created the template for casting Muslims as the “Other”, in this case for apparently denying the majority community their right to worship Lord Ram in the spot claimed as his birthplace. As Muslims are still the faces against which people are being mobilised on multiple fronts, fighting on about the mandir-masjid after the apex court verdict would be self-defeating. The way politics and debates are framed these days the Muslim community needs to be tactical about issues it allows itself to be dragged into.  
Besides, had the Muslim side won, what could they have done? They could not have rebuilt a mosque; but they could have claimed a constitutional victory and that would have counted. At the end of this long journey there is also a recognition that the only battles the community needs to engage with are for jobs, education and health. But will they be allowed to do so? Is there any guarantee that more issues seeking to extract “historical revenge” will not be resurrected?  
Finally, the onus of making this a moment of national reconciliation rests not on the minority community but with the government and India’s pre-eminent political party. The language spoken since the verdict has been temperate and BJP spokespersons have obviously been instructed to tone down the triumphalism. After the Ayodhya verdict, the prime minister spoke of unity in diversity and gave a call for a New India with new goals.   
As a first step, the government would do well to see that the Trust proposed by the Supreme Court to oversee the implementation of its order includes men and women capable of human empathy and giving dignity to others. In this new India, the entire ideological fraternity that answers to the prime minister could assure minorities that the sort of trauma that visited them with the Ayodhya dispute, will not happen again.   
Yes, we all want to move ahead and heal. Please allow us to do so.

     Saba Naqvi is a good researcher and able journalist of the country. However her anti BJP thought is quite clearly visible in her utterances and writings. In whole of her blog one can easily read her mind the way she articulates the incident of demolishing of Babri structure which she still calls a Masjid. Though, ASI excavation could prove an un-Islamic structure below the Babri structure, but didn't give it's observations on whether the Mosque was built by demolishing the un-Islamic structure beneath it. It may be due to the scope of excavation as defined to them. But anyone can assume as to what a Mosque would be serving the purpose at the epicenter of the place called Ayodhya, having temples all around. She very cleverly tries to avoid the butcherly acts of demolishing of thousands of temples during Mughal and British rule, wherein both Invaders tried their best to completely destroy the Hindu Vedic culture of this very ancient civilization. But they couldn't do so as the Vedic culture is not bound by any one book and is evolutionary in it's very nature and being very flexible devoid of any rigidity and far away from expansionists point of view. Not even a word of appreciation on this rich Vedic culture. Whether she too forgot that her ancestors were also Hindus only. The so called peudo-secularists agreed to maintain status quo on the Mosque Temple issues of the country. This was a blunder which is being corrected now. The best thing would have been that Saba along with all the right thinking Muslims of the country should have come forward and sorted out the issue by agreeing to bring those temples to their original forms which the Hindus have pointed out such as Varanasi and Mathura temples. That's the reason she still has a doubt that "" Is there any guarantee that more issues seeking to extract *historical revenge* will not be resurrected "". Still they have time to set an example of coexistence by correcting the butcherly act of Mughals desecrating of our temples of faith.Everyone including Muslims want to move forward, but she couldn't leave her sarcasm when she says "" They must be included in the new India"" as if someone has excluded them, rather on the other hand they themselves chose to live in their colonies all together having their own identities. She couldn't convince them not to kill cows who is a sacred animal to their Hindu brethrens. She will always talk of Sakshi Maharaj and others but she is silent on the likes of Owaisis. This speaks volumes of her being biased towards her own community, though she claims to be an impartial writer. First thing the Indian Muslims should do is to only focus on their community's education, their development, population control and STOP thinking that Islam is only the best religion of all and some day it will rule India once again. They have respect all the religions and have to learn to live in coexistence. Simply mentioning of Ganga Jamuni tahzeeb is not going to work....  Read More

35,1617655299-246,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Empathy is the key to win confidence.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/india-as-i-see-it-a-soldiers-view/empathy-is-the-key-to-win-confidence/,Empathy is the key to win confidence.,"December 26, 2019, 12:47 PM  IST","Late 17 th and early 18 th century we as a Society were going through a process of awakening and realization of our Political rights and concept of Nationhood. During this period mainly the elites from each religious community be it Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Dalits, were spearheading the movements demanding political rights for their own community and each one of them wanted a slice of cake even at the cost of peace.
As a result in 1900s our Leaders had to overcome such divisive challenges in the form of Partition of Bengal, demands for separate electorate for Muslims, projected by Muslim League and for Dalits by Ambedkar and Hindu mahasabha for Hindus.. The question as to who first sowed the seeds of division is difficult to answer like the one ; WHO CAME FIRST – THE EGG or the Hen. As a matter of fact all of them were complementing each other.
The erstwhile leaders who replaced Brits worked hard and did a reasonably good job to somehow calm down the nerves of each community and although the freedom came at huge cost but they still managed to keep India’s unity and integrity intact. The idea of Freedom and realisation of Political rights took time to sink in may be because India then had a literacy rate of just 12% and people living in abject poverty and deprivation could not think beyond fulfilling their basic needs.
However, in last seven decades having risen from that abyss, our stomachs now filled and literacy rate risen to almost 79 % in urban India, the society now has different concerns and needs. We, therefore as a society have now graduated to the next level and are now seeking answers to some fundamental issues; Who We Are? What Is Our History? What As A Society We Want To Be? What are our core values? What should be our place in the comity of nations and What should be done to prevent inimical powers from harming us? What sort of society do we wish to be?
When we were struggling for freedom, the people were more concerned about fulfilling their basic needs and getting out of slavery, however, Its no more about Freedom now, the society is now more concerned about its security, its self esteem about its identity and its history.
It is therefore quite likely that once again, during this stage the society will have to face many such turmoils and challenges, like it faced in 1947, because ours is a society which is multi in every aspect. Although we have a common history but it is a complex one and at times it appears as if each community has a score to settle with the other. South Indians feel that North Indians drove them out from North India, Lower caste Hindus do not trust the upper caste Hindus who have tormented them for centuries, Hindus have a deep mistrust of muslims for obvious reasons.
Thus in such a situation of mistrust within the society, when the current Government brings out legislations like CAA and undertakes steps which are although need of the hour as far as security is concerned, it is likely that those steps may emotionally unnerve and demoralizes a particular community.
The Govt must have its tentacles always erect so that it can empathise with the needs and concerns of each component of the society.
Sadly, the Government this time failed as it could not empathise with the concerns of the Muslims and thus the successive events like ; repealing article 370, arrest of political leaders of valley who were mainly Muslims, the Ayodhya verdict which went against the Muslims aspirations, Banning triple Talaq, banning cow slaughter that lead to lynching and finally the NRC and CAA created an environment of insecurity amongst the Muslims. More so, with a crore plus netizens using social media to target the muslims, it some times appeared that muslims are unwanted in their own country.
A ruling junta that eulogises Savarkar, known for anti muslim stance, can not ride two boats, On one hand its IT Cell and some of its leaders are regularly heaping insults to Bapu and Nehruji, spewing venom at Muslims and eulogies Savarkar and on the other hand Mr Modi is applauding and citing Bapu’s views to justify his actions. How could the two go together?
The ruling party must understand that with this kind of behavior at display each action of theirs will always be viewed skeptically by the minorities. Such a Govt cannot afford to hide behind Gandhiji and push through such measures in haste. They need to win the confidence of the minorities. And if they want to win the trust of the minorities then they got to be seen walking the same road as prescribed by Bapu. We must also remember that how so ever great Bapu was, when religion became predominant and an emotive issue, even he failed to win the Muslims’ confidence. And that’s why he kept requesting people on both sides to rein in their religious sentiments but he ultimately fell to the assassin’s bullets who was driven by religious frenzy.
Therefore, SABKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS is fine as far as wining elections are concerned but significance of Religion in igniting passion and provoking violence can never be undermined and none can understand better than the BJP and RSS ; They have been using religion to mobilize support.
If Sikhs in a disciplined organization like Army could mutiny after the Golden temple was attacked, and communal riots in Gujarat can take place on the issue of a Kite, then all the above mentioned steps that the Govt has taken recently would have surely disturbed the Muslims and it was really stupid on the part of the Govt that it could not foresee all this before pushing in the CAA bill.
What is happening in the country today is because Mr Modi and Amit Shah and their entire Hindutva Brigade on Social media have not comprehended the complete consequences of what they are trying to achieve. They thought that they can bulldoze their way using majority in parliament and fulfill all their poll promises. Palming off the responsibility for this chaos on to others is not likely to succeed.
More so, when in last six years the political rivals of Mr Modi despite all their efforts ; AWARD WAAPSI, INTOLAREANCE CAPMAPIGN have not been able to pin him down, they are now not going to let this Opportunity go bye, even if they have to use Muslims and Young students as Cannon fodder.
Hence, the Government must get back to Bapu’s / Nehruji’s times and learn as to how those leaders despite all the handicaps tackled such contentious issues and ensured that Hindus, North Indians-South Indians, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis remained united, they not only got us Freedom from the foreign power but also kept the country united, for more than seven decades.
The duo Mr Modi and Mr Amit need to learn as to How did those Leaders overcome those challenges? And How did they keep the inherent divisive flock together? In my opinion what worked in their favour was that they Empathised with the concerns and problems of the people. They were genuinely concerned about the welfare of the society. If we all, that includes Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs etc empathise with each others’ concerns, these problems and mistrust that we have today will vanish and this in turn will also help us finding solutions to challenges that are connected to our security, identity and self esteem.

     India is destroying itself trying to destroy Jawaharlal Nehru.  Abrogation of 370 or CAA have been claimed to correct Nehru s mistakes.  Demonetization was supposed to unearth black money since 1947.  Liberals crying fowl now have been complicit in Nehru bashing at least by selective silence.  Even a year ago nobody thought it was inappropriate to blame long dead Nehru, let alone question the truth of social media campaign.  What goes around comes around...

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",late 17 th and early 18 th century we as a society were going through a process of awakening and realization of our political rights and concept of nationhood during this period mainly the elites from each religious community be it muslims hindus sikhs dalits were spearheading the movements demanding political rights for their own community and each one of them wanted a slice of cake even at the cost of peaceas a result in 1900s our leaders had to overcome such divisive challenges in the form of partition of bengal demands for separate electorate for muslims projected by muslim league and for dalits by ambedkar and hindu mahasabha for hindus the question as to who first sowed the seeds of division is difficult to answer like the one  who came first – the egg or the hen as a matter of fact all of them were complementing each otherthe erstwhile leaders who replaced brits worked hard and did a reasonably good job to somehow calm down the nerves of each community and although the freedom came at huge cost but they still managed to keep indias unity and integrity intact the idea of freedom and realisation of political rights took time to sink in may be because india then had a literacy rate of just 12 and people living in abject poverty and deprivation could not think beyond fulfilling their basic needshowever in last seven decades having risen from that abyss our stomachs now filled and literacy rate risen to almost 79  in urban india the society now has different concerns and needs we therefore as a society have now graduated to the next level and are now seeking answers to some fundamental issues who we are what is our history what as a society we want to be what are our core values what should be our place in the comity of nations and what should be done to prevent inimical powers from harming us what sort of society do we wish to bewhen we were struggling for freedom the people were more concerned about fulfilling their basic needs and getting out of slavery however its no more about freedom now the society is now more concerned about its security its self esteem about its identity and its historyit is therefore quite likely that once again during this stage the society will have to face many such turmoils and challenges like it faced in 1947 because ours is a society which is multi in every aspect although we have a common history but it is a complex one and at times it appears as if each community has a score to settle with the other south indians feel that north indians drove them out from north india lower caste hindus do not trust the upper caste hindus who have tormented them for centuries hindus have a deep mistrust of muslims for obvious reasonsthus in such a situation of mistrust within the society when the current government brings out legislations like caa and undertakes steps which are although need of the hour as far as security is concerned it is likely that those steps may emotionally unnerve and demoralizes a particular communitythe govt must have its tentacles always erect so that it can empathise with the needs and concerns of each component of the societysadly the government this time failed as it could not empathise with the concerns of the muslims and thus the successive events like  repealing article 370 arrest of political leaders of valley who were mainly muslims the ayodhya verdict which went against the muslims aspirations banning triple talaq banning cow slaughter that lead to lynching and finally the nrc and caa created an environment of insecurity amongst the muslims more so with a crore plus netizens using social media to target the muslims it some times appeared that muslims are unwanted in their own countrya ruling junta that eulogises savarkar known for anti muslim stance can not ride two boats on one hand its it cell and some of its leaders are regularly heaping insults to bapu and nehruji spewing venom at muslims and eulogies savarkar and on the other hand mr modi is applauding and citing bapus views to justify his actions how could the two go togetherthe ruling party must understand that with this kind of behavior at display each action of theirs will always be viewed skeptically by the minorities such a govt cannot afford to hide behind gandhiji and push through such measures in haste they need to win the confidence of the minorities and if they want to win the trust of the minorities then they got to be seen walking the same road as prescribed by bapu we must also remember that how so ever great bapu was when religion became predominant and an emotive issue even he failed to win the muslims confidence and thats why he kept requesting people on both sides to rein in their religious sentiments but he ultimately fell to the assassins bullets who was driven by religious frenzytherefore sabka saath sabka vikas is fine as far as wining elections are concerned but significance of religion in igniting passion and provoking violence can never be undermined and none can understand better than the bjp and rss  they have been using religion to mobilize supportif sikhs in a disciplined organization like army could mutiny after the golden temple was attacked and communal riots in gujarat can take place on the issue of a kite then all the above mentioned steps that the govt has taken recently would have surely disturbed the muslims and it was really stupid on the part of the govt that it could not foresee all this before pushing in the caa billwhat is happening in the country today is because mr modi and amit shah and their entire hindutva brigade on social media have not comprehended the complete consequences of what they are trying to achieve they thought that they can bulldoze their way using majority in parliament and fulfill all their poll promises palming off the responsibility for this chaos on to others is not likely to

36,1617655472-289,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ayodhya verdict and the roshomon effect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/captains-musings/ayodhya-verdict-and-the-roshomon-effect/,Ayodhya verdict and the roshomon effect,"November 16, 2019, 10:55 AM  IST","The incidents leading up to the recent Ayodhya verdict by The Supreme Court and subsequent reactions reminded me of Akira Kurosowa’s much acclaimed film Roshomon. In that extraordinary movie the wife of a samurai is raped by a notorious Bandit in a forest. The husband who’s tied up by the samurai watches the horrific act. The bandit after the rape, failing to win over the wife to marry him, challenges the Samurai to a duel and kills him. A wood cutter collecting wood nearby witnesses the rape and the killing of the samurai. The stories narrated by the four witnesses including the dead husband told through a ‘medium ‘, are varying , conflicting , contradictory, confusing and seem motivated by self interest and coloured by ego and attempts to save face. The Ayodhya verdict and the subsequent flood of widely differing opinions and reactions in print and electronic media, the infinite variety of comments in social media and the cacophony of multiple voices on television channels by the scores of opinion makers , much like the film Roshomon , depict multiple realities revealing the difficulty of understanding past events , presented by subjectivity of truth and uncertainty of factual realities. While there are four different narratives of the same event in the film by four witnesses, in the Ayodhya case there are innumerable actors with multitude of opinions with contrasting shades and versions and interpretations. History, mythology, fact, faith , belief, religion, rituals , politics , communal tension, vested interests , greed for land, traditions and the law, the letter and spirit of the constitution have all co mingled and left varying impressions on the numerous actors. The religious leaders , the political parties, the affiliates of political parties like the RSS , VHP, The Muslim Personal Law Board; The Sunny Wakf Board , the many Ram Janma Bhumi associated Trusts, the various extremists and fringe elements, the warring parties who are parties to the suit – on both sides of the divide- , the public at large, bureaucrats and the government , will bring to bear their influence on judges who are only all too human.
In such complex and ambiguous situations where myriad events from a hoary past are effaced and altered and superimposed with fresh images and writings , as in a palimpsest , are contested and where disagreements leading to sectarian violence goes back a hundred and fifty years and remains unresolved through litigations and mediations , that the Supreme Court bench comprising five judges , who can also never be completely free of subjective and objective perceptions, gives a unanimous decision after sifting through thousands of pages of arguments and evidence and after hearing hundreds of witnesses and lawyers , such a judgement is a miracle in itself and must be hailed and welcomed. One could argue that there could have been different options leading to other kinds of judgements. The Supreme Court had to choose an ideologically neutral option from various choices before it. An easy escape route was ‘not deciding’ by evading a seemingly intractable , complex and sensitive case such as this and keep postponing through prevarication as was done over the last since 70 years. The provincial administrations before independence during the British rule also allowed this to simmer and fester. Based on available evidence that possession of parts of the disputed site was jointly held by Muslims and Hindus since many decades and bearing in mind the dispute originated in 1850, and the mosque was built 450 years ago on ancient temple ruins with no proof that it was destroyed for building the mosque , but taking into account the belief of Hindus that since time immemorial that Ram a sacred deity was born there but unable to determine legally the title of the land in favour of either party, the judges could have delivered a cussed judgement and ousted both parties and allotted alternate spaces to both and seal up the land forever. That would have been another Molotov cocktail left unattended while the fire was still unextinguished. There could have been other options for a final verdict. But the judges in their wisdom , going by assurances from all parties that they will respect and abide by the verdict regardless of which way it goes, have opted to put a final closure on the dispute. In a typical ancient method practiced by panchayat system which decides a dispute between warring parties taking into account not only legal factors but emotions and all angles and aspects of a dispute, the five judges have delivered a verdict allotting the disputed site where Babri Masjid once stood to the Hindus and an alternate site of five acres in a prominent place in Ayodhya to the Muslims , leaving it to the magnanimity and prudence of the government to allot the specific site for building a new Masjid. May be the Court could have allotted the alternate site within the 67 acres acquired by the government where once the Babri was located where the idols of Ram are also kept and put a lid on the matter instead of leaving that part open. But the judges may have had their own reasons to leave that discretion to the government. It was time to put out the fire and end the fight once and for all.
Already there are voices of protest, criticism and expressions of disappointment on the judgement from the Muslim bodies and spokespersons. The parties to the dispute from the Muslim side are also not in agreement on their future action plan and are yet to decide their way forward. A few have said they are not in favour of a review petition. The various sections of the Hindus are not aligned on how the temple will be run or who should be on the proposed government Trust. The numerous Hindu religious orders, sadhus and sants representing the many religious outfits fighting for a Ram temple in Ayodhya along with the larger well known national bodies like the VHP and RSS while unanimously welcoming the verdict have already frenetically begun lobbying , trying to find a voice and a place for themselves in the Government appointed Trust responsible for construction and the management of the temple. All these are not uncommon. Such a role for oneself is after all, all about influence , power and money as the Ram temple will attract millions of Hindus. It will be according to many as important a pilgrimage site as Kashi. The Muslims who put up a fight for retaining the disputed site where Babri Masjid once stood have to come to terms and decide on the new Masjid – its location, construction and management. It will attract millions of their faith and can also be a tourist attraction by the sheer drama and history behind all this. But many are still undecided and divided on their next steps. Will they file a review petition , will they continue the fight by different means ? All these disagreements on both sides are normal and not unexpected. Many temple trusts , religious bodies and mutts , Ashrams and Cults of God men , Wakfs, Churches and missionary denominations have often been in bitter disputes over control of the Trusts and its properties and its funds, and have gone to court over the way they are managed and run. The devotees divided on sectarian lines even have contested the forms of worship , the text of chants, or the symbol used on the deity’s forehead as was the case between the warring priests of the Thirupathi temple which is still unresolved to satisfaction.
The many Trusts claiming to represent Ram Lalla may one day fight in the future over the management and control of the proposed Ayodhya temple but today the large amorphous, devout Hindus across the country are happy. The various Muslim bodies may be peeved that the judgement was not fair , but it is heartening that they have affirmed that they will respect the judgement and have appealed for peace. The common Muslim may not be joyous but is heaving a sigh of relief that there is a chance now for communal harmony and he can get along with his life.
So we can sing joyously with Robert Browning-
The lark’s on the wing ;

The snail’s on the thorn;

God’s in his heaven –

All’s right with the world !

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",the incidents leading up to the recent ayodhya verdict by the supreme court and subsequent reactions reminded me of akira kurosowas much acclaimed film roshomon in that extraordinary movie the wife of a samurai is raped by a notorious bandit in a forest the husband whos tied up by the samurai watches the horrific act the bandit after the rape failing to win over the wife to marry him challenges the samurai to a duel and kills him a wood cutter collecting wood nearby witnesses the rape and the killing of the samurai the stories narrated by the four witnesses including the dead husband told through a medium  are varying  conflicting  contradictory confusing and seem motivated by self interest and coloured by ego and attempts to save face the ayodhya verdict and the subsequent flood of widely differing opinions and reactions in print and electronic media the infinite variety of comments in social media and the cacophony of multiple voices on television channels by the scores of opinion makers  much like the film roshomon  depict multiple realities revealing the difficulty of understanding past events  presented by subjectivity of truth and uncertainty of factual realities while there are four different narratives of the same event in the film by four witnesses in the ayodhya case there are innumerable actors with multitude of opinions with contrasting shades and versions and interpretations history mythology fact faith  belief religion rituals  politics  communal tension vested interests  greed for land traditions and the law the letter and spirit of the constitution have all co mingled and left varying impressions on the numerous actors the religious leaders  the political parties the affiliates of political parties like the rss  vhp the muslim personal law board the sunny wakf board  the many ram janma bhumi associated trusts the various extremists and fringe elements the warring parties who are parties to the suit – on both sides of the divide  the public at large bureaucrats and the government  will bring to bear their influence on judges who are only all too humanin such complex and ambiguous situations where myriad events from a hoary past are effaced and altered and superimposed with fresh images and writings  as in a palimpsest  are contested and where disagreements leading to sectarian violence goes back a hundred and fifty years and remains unresolved through litigations and mediations  that the supreme court bench comprising five judges  who can also never be completely free of subjective and objective perceptions gives a unanimous decision after sifting through thousands of pages of arguments and evidence and after hearing hundreds of witnesses and lawyers  such a judgement is a miracle in itself and must be hailed and welcomed one could argue that there could have been different options leading to other kinds of judgements the supreme court had to choose an ideologically neutral option from various choices before it an easy escape route was not deciding by evading a seemingly intractable  complex and sensitive case such as this and keep postponing through prevarication as was done over the last since 70 years the provincial administrations before independence during the british rule also allowed this to simmer and fester based on available evidence that possession of parts of the disputed site was jointly held by muslims and hindus since many decades and bearing in mind the dispute originated in 1850 and the mosque was built 450 years ago on ancient temple ruins with no proof that it was destroyed for building the mosque  but taking into account the belief of hindus that since time immemorial that ram a sacred deity was born there but unable to determine legally the title of the land in favour of either party the judges could have delivered a cussed judgement and ousted both parties and allotted alternate spaces to both and seal up the land forever that would have been another molotov cocktail left unattended while the fire was still unextinguished there could have been other options for a final verdict but the judges in their wisdom  going by assurances from all parties that they will respect and abide by the verdict regardless of which way it goes have opted to put a final closure on the dispute in a typical ancient method practiced by panchayat system which decides a dispute between warring parties taking into account not only legal factors but emotions and all angles and aspects of a dispute the five judges have delivered a verdict allotting the disputed site where babri masjid once stood to the hindus and an alternate site of five acres in a prominent place in ayodhya to the muslims  leaving it to the magnanimity and prudence of the government to allot the specific site for building a new masjid may be the court could have allotted the alternate site within the 67 acres acquired by the government where once the babri was located where the idols of ram are also kept and put a lid on the matter instead of leaving that part open but the judges may have had their own reasons to leave that discretion to the government it was time to put out the fire and end the fight once and for allalready there are voices of protest criticism and expressions of disappointment on the judgement from the muslim bodies and spokespersons the parties to the dispute from the muslim side are also not in agreement on their future action plan and are yet to decide their way forward a few have said they are not in favour of a review petition the various sections of the hindus are not aligned on how the temple will be run or who should be on the proposed government trust the numerous hindu religious orders sadhus and sants representing the many religious outfits fighting for a ram temple in ayodhya along with the larger well known national bodies like the vhp and rss while unanimously welcoming the verdict have already frenetically begun lobbying  trying to find a voice and a place for themselves in the government appointed trust responsible for construction and the management of the temple all these are not uncommon such a role for oneself is after all all about influence  power and money as the ram temple will attract millions of hindus it will be according to many as important a pilgrimage site as kashi the muslims who put up a fight for retaining the disputed site where babri masjid once stood have to come to terms and decide on the new masjid – its location construction and management it will attract millions of their faith and can also be a tourist attraction by the sheer drama and history behind all this but many are still undecided and divided on their next steps will they file a review petition  will they continue the fight by different means  all these disagreements on both sides are normal and not unexpected many temple trusts  religious bodies and mutts  ashrams and cults of god men  wakfs churches and missionary denominations have often been in bitter disputes over control of the trusts and its properties and its funds and have gone to court over the way they are managed and run the devotees divided on sectarian lines even have contested the forms of worship  the text of chants or the symbol used on the deitys forehead as was the case between the warring priests of the thirupathi temple which is still unresolved to satisfactionthe many trusts claiming to represent ram lalla may one day fight in the future over the management and control of the proposed ayodhya temple but today the large amorphous devout hindus across the country are happy the various muslim bodies may be peeved that the judgement was not fair  but it is heartening that they have affirmed that they will respect the judgement and have appealed for peace the common muslim may not be joyous but is heaving a sigh of relief that there is a chance now for communal harmony and he can get along with his lifeso we can sing joyously with robert browningthe larks on the wing the snails on the thorngods in his heaven –alls right with the world

 The problem is that the verdict perverts the law and paves the ground for fresh hostilities against the minorities
The Supreme Court must redeem the law, enabling a compromise that respects both faith and minority rights


MR

KRISHNA Yadav, alias Krishna Vasudev, you stand accused of a long list

of unlawful acts, ranging from minor misdemeanours all the way to mass

murder. As a child, you indulged in petty theft, as a young man, you

are charged with assorted acts of sexual misconduct ranging from

violating the modesty of women on the banks of the Yamuna to adultery.

You stand accused of causing serious environmental damage, by uprooting

an entire mountain. In adulthood, your crimes become more serious: you

are charged with multiple counts of regicide, polygamy on a grand

scale, embracing 16,000-odd wives, instigating dishonourable conduct on

the battlefield against the rules of combat, resulting in the death of

two kings. Finally, one Gandhari has accused you of mass murder,

producing thousands of widows and orphans. What do you have to say in

your defence?"" 

    Such

a chargesheet is conceivable, now that the Ayodhya verdict has

converted gods into historical individuals, after colonial

jurisprudence had converted Hindu gods into juridical entities who can

sue and be sued. In his defence, Krishna would have no option but to

tell the judge that different yardsticks apply to gods and to men, that

what might appear criminal in a mortal might be supremely just and

noble in a god, that the codes of meaning and significance embedded in

actions lend themselves to multiple interpretations, the sublime of

which would be valid while evaluating godly conduct. Gods transcend

man’s morality and ethics, in fact, are outside the compass of human

law. 
    Conversion of a god into a human who, were he to stray

into a Maharashtra village, might be issued a 12-digit unique identity,

is but one of the verdict’s deficiencies. 
    But should we

discuss the deficiencies of the judgment when the nation is keen to

move on? Doesn’t the verdict offer a workable compromise to resolve the

dispute, separate politics from religion and let the nation focus on

economic growth and prosperity? Isn’t splitting hair over the verdict

an attempt to breathe fire into the dying embers of Muslim anger? 
    Such

reasoning glosses over some cracks that have the potential to grow into

deep tectonic faults. The country should move forward and a compromise

is desirable — unquestionably. But should the compromise be forged by

the courts? Does the particular manner in which the compromise has been

forged work towards inter-community peace or does it pave the ground

for fresh hostility? It is vital to answer these questions. 
    Courts

are meant to enforce the writ of the Constitution, the bedrock of

institutional protection of minority rights, crucial for cohesion in

our composite, diverse nation. If the courts choose pragmatism over the

law, they would fail the Constitution, and erode the trust of different

minority groupings in the state’s institutional commitment to protect

minority rights. If compromise has to be struck, going beyond the law’s

remit, the courts should not get involved or, if it feels that a

compromise is warranted, say

explicitly that the matter is beyond legal resolution and the parties

should find a settlement outside the law. This has a precedent. The

Kerala High Court declared, delivering its verdict on a protracted

squabble among different Christian denominations, that the matter was

for the court of god to decide, not for the court of man. This forced

the parties to the dispute to work out a compromise. 
    The

Allahabad High Court’s compromise has multiple infirmities. We already

saw how it degrades faith, converting gods into historical individuals.

Then it uses faith to justify property title. Why should not the

‘faithful’ now grab additional real estate? They only need to prove a

sufficient mass of faith and invoke the Ayodhya precedent to get what

they want. Demands on Kashi and Mathura have already been raised. 
    The

verdict constructs history (locating Ram’s birthplace) and deconstructs

it, dismissing 400 odd years of intervening history in deciding the

legal status of the disputed title. This is perverse use of the law. 
    The

Supreme Court must redeem the law, exorcising these infirmities from

the body of Indian jurisprudence. The political import of the verdict

is to lend legitimacy to the campaign to demolish the mosque. This is

another reason to oppose the verdict. 
    This is not to say that

faith carries no weight. On the contrary. In the Ramayana, when Bharat

visits Ram in exile to request his return to the throne, Ram asks after

his people. In particular, he asks after the Charvakas, a group of

non-conforming atheists and materialists. If this minority on the

margins is fine, the mainstream is assuredly so — this was the

political ethics that Gandhi championed by his term Ramarajya. In that

Ram’s name, the Sangh Parivar has sought to excoriate today’s

minorities and demolished the mosque. That is perversion of faith,

endorsed by the Ayodhya verdict . 
    We need a remedial verdict

from the Supreme Court and a new compromise outside the courts, based

on respect for both faith and minority rights.

Move on India, let the past not hold us hostage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/a-new-beginning-verdict-must-herald-end-of-mandir-masjid-politics-move-on-india-let-the-past-not-hold-us-hostage/,"A new beginning: Verdict must herald end of mandir-masjid politics. Move on India, let the past not hold us hostage","November 11, 2019, 8:38 AM  IST","On Saturday five judges of the highest court of the land, including the Chief Justice of India, put their best foot forward to deliver a unanimous verdict on what has been an intractable religious dispute, running on for more than a century. The judicial resolution by the topmost court came after India’s politicians proved themselves unequal to the task and all mediation efforts failed. Let the verdict now draw a line under the dispute, so that India can heal and move on. A good start has been made with most political parties welcoming the judgment. At stake is individual progress, communal harmony, national unity and constitutional morality. India’s multicultural ethos has always prided itself for tolerance to diversity and accepting the equality of religions.
In allocating the disputed land where Babri Masjid once stood for constructing a Rama temple, Supreme Court has recognised evidence of a long unbroken tradition of worship by Hindus at the site. By directing the central/ UP government to award five acres of land within Ayodhya city at a prominent location to build a mosque, SC was conscious that justice would not prevail if Muslims were not remedied for the 1949 desecration when idols were surreptitiously placed inside Babri Masjid followed by its unlawful destruction in 1992.
Those resorting to triumphalism must understand the spirit behind SC accepting the maintainability of Ram Lalla’s title claim. Piety and devotion of the faithful and not political, divisive or destructive machinations carried the day in favour of a temple at the site. The Centre as well as state governments must also accept and strictly uphold this judgment’s stipulation calling on them to abide by the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991, which forbids the conversion of any other place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
SC has invoked the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993, to direct Centre to create a trust to oversee temple construction. Only those willing to uphold the Places of Worship Act must find a place on the Board of Trustees, lest this creates a precedent and incentive for fuelling other mandir-masjid disputes. Picking up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to set aside bitterness and fear and move ahead as one for the country’s development, BJP and saffron parties must avoid triumphalism and drop future mandir-masjid agitations. Let there be no repeat of 1992. India has had enough.

39,1617655338-256,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Cool the passions: SC does well to treat Ayodhya as a land dispute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/cool-the-passions-sc-does-well-to-treat-ayodhya-as-a-land-dispute/,Cool the passions: SC does well to treat Ayodhya as a land dispute,"February 9, 2018, 7:21 PM  IST","The Supreme Court’s resolve to treat the Babri Masjid–Ramjanmabhoomi dispute as a pure land dispute is welcome, as it clears a great deal of clutter on the path to a legal solution. Attempts at mediation have failed and “sentiments” have been bruited about for far too long, making the dispute seem well-nigh intractable. A democracy has to be based on rule of law; going down the path of sentiments can only be a recipe for anarchy, disorder, riots and mayhem. As a corollary, extraneous parties who are in the fight for all sorts of political or theological reasons need to be kept out – whether they are Hindu bodies, Muslim bodies, right wingers, left wingers, spiritual gurus or anybody else.
The politics of the dispute has smouldered for long and there will be no end in sight as long as there are electoral benefits to corner. But legality which has as its premise only the indubitable evidence on record rather than suppositions and sentiments is a different ball game – it is the only possible route to a lasting and peaceful resolution given that even long drawn out attempts at mediation have failed.
It is important for India’s democratic institutions to reassert that the rule of law will take precedence. Investors have little confidence in a state kneeling before or whipping up vigilantism and a judiciary that struggles to resolve civil disputes. Casting aside narrow sentimentalism and politicking and governing dispassionately can be the best advertisement for “New India”. If judges can blank out the noise around them and focus solely on the documents presented to them, there could be a closure to the title dispute. The political class and civil society must respect the verdict and lend a helping hand to restore communal harmony.

40,1617655327-253,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Redeem law from Ayodhya perversion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/cursor/redeem-law-from-ayodhya-perversion/,Redeem law from Ayodhya perversion,"October 7, 2010, 12:30 PM  IST","Mr Krishna Yadav, alias Krishna Vasudev, you stand accused of a long list of unlawful acts, ranging from minor misdemeanours all the way to mass murder. As a child, you indulged in petty theft, as a young man, you are charged with assorted acts of sexual misconduct ranging from violating the modesty of women on the banks of the Yamuna to adultery. You stand accused of causing serious environmental damage, by uprooting an entire mountain . 

In adulthood, your crimes become more serious : you are charged with multiple counts of regicide, polygamy on a grand scale, embracing 16,000-odd wives, instigating dishonourable conduct on the battlefield against the rules of combat , resulting in the death of two kings. Finally, one Gandhari has accused you of mass murder, producing thousands of widows and orphans. What do you have to say in your defence?""

Such a chargesheet is conceivable, now that the Ayodhya verdict has converted gods into historical individuals, after colonial jurisprudence had converted Hindu gods into juridical entities who can sue and be sued. In his defence, Krishna would have no option but to tell the judge that different yardsticks apply to gods and to men, that what might appear criminal in a mortal might be supremely just and noble in a god, that the codes of meaning and significance embedded in actions lend themselves to multiple interpretations, the sublime of which would be valid while evaluating godly conduct. 

Gods transcend man’s morality and ethics, in fact, are outside the compass of human law.
Conversion of a god into a human who, were he to stray into a Maharashtra village, might be issued a 12-digit unique identity, is but one of the verdict’s deficiencies.

But should we discuss the deficiencies of the judgment when the nation is keen to move on? Doesn’t the verdict offer a workable compromise to resolve the dispute, separate politics from religion and let the nation focus on economic growth and prosperity? Isn’t splitting hair over the verdict an attempt to breathe fire into the dying embers of Muslim anger?

Such reasoning glosses over some cracks that have the potential to grow into deep tectonic faults. The country should move forward and a compromise is desirable — unquestionably . But should the compromise be forged by the courts? Does the particular manner in which the compromise has been forged work towards inter-community peace or does it pave the ground for fresh hostility? It is vital to answer these questions.

Courts are meant to enforce the writ of the Constitution, the bedrock of institutional protection of minority rights, crucial for cohesion in our composite, diverse nation . If the courts choose pragmatism over the law, they would fail the Constitution, and erode the trust of different minority groupings in the state’s institutional commitment to protect minority rights. If compromise has to be struck, going beyond the law’s remit, the courts should not get involved or, if it feels that a compromise is warranted, say explicitly that the matter is beyond legal resolution and the parties should find a settlement outside the law. This has a precedent. 

The Kerala High Court declared, delivering its verdict on a protracted squabble among different Christian denominations, that the matter was for the court of god to decide, not for the court of man. This forced the parties to the dispute to work out a compromise.

The Allahabad High Court’s compromise has multiple infirmities. We already saw how it degrades faith, converting gods into historical individuals. Then it uses faith to justify property title. Why should not the ‘faithful’ now grab additional real estate? They only need to prove a sufficient mass of faith and invoke the Ayodhya precedent to get what they want. Demands on Kashi and Mathura have already been raised.

The verdict constructs history (locating Ram’s birthplace) and deconstructs it, dismissing 400 odd years of intervening history in deciding the legal status of the disputed title. This is perverse use of the law.
The Supreme Court must redeem the law, exorcising these infirmities from the body of Indian jurisprudence. The political import of the verdict is to lend legitimacy to the campaign to demolish the mosque. This is another reason to oppose the verdict.

This is not to say that faith carries no weight. On the contrary. In the Ramayana, when Bharat visits Ram in exile to request his return to the throne, Ram asks after his people. In particular, he asks after the Charvakas , a group of non-conforming atheists and materialists. If this minority on the margins is fine, the mainstream is assuredly so — this was the political ethics that Gandhi championed by his term Ramarajya. In that Ram’s name, the Sangh Parivar has sought to excoriate today’s minorities and demolished the mosque. That is perversion of faith, endorsed by the Ayodhya verdict.

We need a remedial verdict from the Supreme Court and a new compromise outside the courts, based on respect for both faith and minority rights.

41,1617655241-231,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,We are the world’s biggest Banana Republic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Main-Street/we-are-a-banana-republic-and-it-s-going-to-the-dogs/,We are the world’s biggest Banana Republic,"September 24, 2010, 11:23 PM  IST","A couple of days ago, a Scottish delegate got a shock of his life when he saw a dog shitting on a bed inside a ‘swanky’ apartment at the Commonwealth Games village in Delhi. The Scotsman clicked a photo of the dog, and now the picture is part of the evidence submitted by the Scottish delegation to the Organising Committee to prove that the multi-million dollar village is not ""fit for human habitation"". In the past few days, foreign TV crews and photographers have been busy chasing and clicking photos of dogs – peeing and shitting in the apartments, running on practice tracks, jumping into swimming pools and sleeping under the police cars and other vehicles parked at Games sites and venues. The foreigners are horrified – and scared to death – by the sight of street dogs running wild in the ""sanitized areas"". For them, it’s a sign that India is not ready for the Games and the infrastructure here is not ""world class"".
 
Now, there is no doubt that India’s carefully created, and airbrushed, image of an ’emerging superpower’ and the ‘second-fastest growing economy’ in the world rots in the piles of rubbish. The myth of ‘India Shining’ (BJP’s slogan) and ‘India Rising’ (the Congress’ slogan) has been busted. We have proved to the world – and to ourselves as well – that we are a third world banana republic which is sinking into a bottomless pit.
 
I am not worried about the mismanagement at the Games sites. We shouldn’t have organized the Games at all. The country which in 63 years of independence hasn’t been able to provide proper living houses, clean drinking water, uninterrupted electricity, fulltime jobs, healthy food, clean air and free education to all its citizens despite spending trillions of dollars, how did you expect the same country to pull off an international sporting event without it sinking into the slime and grime of corruption and bad governance.
 
I am not justifying corruption, but it’s a fact that graft is part and parcel of capitalism, though the level differs from country to country. This has been proved by western politicians and Wall Street bankers in the past couple of years. In the US, the bankers and financial giants robbed the American people, mostly the middle and working-class, clean and then declared themselves bankrupt, and they were bailed out by the American government with public money. This was the world’s biggest daylight robbery. And no one, except Michael Moore, raised the red flag. 
In the US, this brazen act of corruption made thousands of houses go under water and millions became jobless, but in India something more sinister and dark has been happening in the garb of the Games. In the past two years or so, the governments of this country and this city have launched a full-scale war on the poor. Millions of poor people from the country’s dustbowls have been brought here to work at the Games’ construction sites. They have been slogging day and night at the venues and living like animals under plastic sheets, sleeping on wet ground and eating filthy food.  That food is just about enough to keep their body and soul together so that they can build the glass and chrome buildings and showcase India Shining to the world.
In 21st century India, the street dogs are luckier than the poor. The dogs make news for shitting on expensive beds and the poor workers go to snake-infested swamps to take a leak at night, get bitten and die and not a soul is stirred.
On one hand the government has brought these people from poverty-ravaged villages to work on its corruption-tainted buildings, and on the other hand lakhs of hard-working but poor people have been thrown out of the city so that the foreigners coming here for the Games do not see the ugly, dirty side of India. Thousands of people living in Yamuna Pushta area were plucked from their houses and dumped on a wasteland in Haryana. Beggars were packed off earlier. Now, the police are scanning the slums of Delhi and Gurgaon and people are being forced to board trains back to their villages. These people have been living and working here for years and suddenly they have been asked to leave. The government doesn’t want any filth in the city during the Games. It’s putting bamboo screens in front of the slums.
But, now the filth is out in the open. The mismanagement and corruption has been exposed by the photos of dirty, filthy and unhygienic apartments at the Games village. And guess who gets blamed for it. Not the politicians or babus or contractors but the poor workers at the site.  And when 27 workers got injured on Wednesday, when the footbridge near the JL Nehru stadium collapsed, they were herded like animals into private vehicles and dumped at a sarkari hospital. No ambulance for them, no post-recovery package for them. Just Rs 50,000 in damages for broken legs, cracked heads and damaged spinal chords.
And, to hide the accident near the Nehru stadium, the area was cordoned off and cops in full riot gear were stationed so that ordinary people and media and foreigners can’t get anywhere near the site and see one more horrendous accident. Suddenly, the government has one solution for every problem across the country: post heavily-armed police and paramilitary men at the scene of a ""disturbance"" and give them license to shoot at will. It happens everyday in Srinagar. It’s happening everyday in the jungles of Chhattisgarh. It’s happening in the villages of West Bengal. It’s happening in the villages of UP. Now, with Ayodhya verdict round the corner, the temple town is being turned into a fortress with men in khaki swarming over it.
These are symptoms of a failed state. We are catching up with Pakistan. We make tall claims about growth, but we treat out poor worse than animals. We aspire to be world power, but we can’t even provide drinking water to all our citizens. We claim to be world’s biggest democracy, but we ‘solve’ all our social and political problems with loaded guns in hand. It’s time we accepted that we are a banana republic and we are going to the dogs.

42,1617655101-199,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Sabarimala Temple: Juggernaut…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/tracking-indian-communities/sabarimala-temple-juggernaut/,Sabarimala Temple: Juggernaut…,"November 11, 2018, 12:46 PM  IST","The Save Sabarimala rath yathra is unlikely to roil Kerala the way the historic Ram temple yathra did in the Hindi belt.
The intention was loud and clear, and the political content too obvious to be ignored. But can the ‘Save Sabarimala’ rath yathra that rolled out from Madhur temple in Kasaragod on Thursday bulldoze the internal contradictions in Hinduism and overcome resurgent dalit opposition to carve out a monolithic Hindutva identity?
BJP state president P S Sreedharan Pillai reminded the audience about the significance of the day of the launch of the rath yathra. “Today is the 91st birthday of L K Advani. BJP had only two MPs when Advani began his rath yathra from Somnath to Ayodhya. But soon he became the strong voice of Indian nationalism and paved the way for BJP’s assumption to power in India. Similarly, this yathra will create a congenial turf in Kerala for the NDA, which has only one MLA at present,” he thundered at Madhur.

But dalit and Left intellectuals feel that the BJP leader’s dream is not rooted in reality – in Kerala, many forces inimical to the Hindutva ideology have a dominant space. “The positive development of the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala is that dalit voices that were marginalised in our society suddenly became acceptable in the mainstream. The resistance against Hindutva propaganda started using the creations of the dalit imagination and language widely after the Sabarimala case,” says Sunny M Kapikkad, dalit thinker and writer.
“The contradictions within Hinduism will be sharpened in the coming days as the yathra moves further. There is a strong feeling among a section in SNDP Yogam against Thushar Vellappalli who is seen as the representative of Sangh-minded Ezhavas. And Punnala Sreekumar of Kerala Pulaya Maha Sabha (KPMS) has emerged powerful within the organization. These developments will be strengthened further. Things will be difficult for the Sangh Parivar if Pinarayi Vijayan sticks on to his firm stand and the Supreme Court rejects the review petitions,” Kapikkad argues.
He believes that the Left in Kerala has finally realised the power of dalit imagination. “It is pertinent to note that in his speeches Pinarayi Vijayan is careful to avoid agitations led by the communists such as Punnapra-Vayalar or Kayyoor. Instead, he focuses on the anti-caste struggles led by leaders like Ayyankali. Deliberations on dalit identities were branded as casteism earlier though we had reiterated that we were speaking about democratic values,” Kapikkad explains.
Historian Dr K N Ganesh believes that the yathra is unlikely to create ripples in Kerala as it did in the case of Advani’s rath yathra. “I don’t think the Sangh Parivar will get a foothold in the state by drumming up support for the Save Sabarimala campaign. There is a sizeable number of minority community members in the state and Left has significant influence among Hindus. So, it is difficult for the Sangh Parivar to make inroads here,” he says. “The photos of renaissance leaders are being used in the yathra as part of the Sangh Parivar’s appropriation strategy as they did in the case of Gandhiji. But none of the leaders supported any practice that excluded women,” Ganesh adds.
“There is a public sphere in Kerala which evolved through struggles over a long period. We should protect the public sphere from the onslaught of the Sangh Parivar. ‘Save Sabarimala’ rath yathra has cleverly concealed the political intention under the garb of protection of faith. Pinarayi government can be ousted through a democratically-conducted election in 2021 if people wish so, but the polarisation the Sangh Parivar wants to bring in can be disastrous,” Ganesh points out.
Sreechithran M J, social observer, feels that things have changed from the initial days after the Supreme Court verdict. “People had an apprehension of the exact implication of the judgment. But now they have a correct picture and majority have realised the political agenda behind the Save Sabarimala campaign. So, I don’t think the yathra would have much impact in society,” he says.
“We have failed to recognise the renaissance in Kerala as a continuing process. That is why the renaissance figures appear to us as characters in epics. The public at large are not disturbed to see the photos of renaissance leaders like Sree Narayana Guru and Ayyankali appearing on a retrogressive yathra because they are unaware of the irony,” says Sreechithran.

the internal contradictions in hinduism and overcome resurgent dalit opposition to carve out a monolithic hindutva identitybjp state president p s sreedharan pillai reminded the audience about the significance of the day of the launch of the rath yathra today is the 91st birthday of l k advani bjp had only two mps when advani began his rath yathra from somnath to ayodhya but soon he became the

thundered at madhurbut dalit and left intellectuals feel that the bjp leaders dream is not rooted in reality – in kerala many forces inimical to the hindutva ideology have a dominant space the positive development of the supreme court verdict on sabarimala is that dalit voices that were marginalised in our society suddenly became acceptable in the mainstream the resistance against hindutva propaganda started using the creations of the dalit imagination and language widely after the sabarimala case says sunny m kapikkad dalit thinker and writerthe contradictions within hinduism will be sharpened in the coming days as the yathra moves further there is a strong feeling among a section in sndp yogam against thushar vellappalli who is seen as the representative of sanghminded ezhavas and punnala sreekumar of kerala pulaya maha sabha kpms has emerged powerful within the organization these developments will be strengthened further things will be difficult for the sangh parivar if pinarayi vijayan sticks on to his firm stand and the supreme court rejects the review petitions kapikkad argueshe believes that the left in kerala has finally realised the power of dalit imagination it is pertinent to note that in his speeches pinarayi vijayan is careful to avoid agitations led by the communists such as punnapravayalar or kayyoor instead he focuses on the anticaste struggles led by leaders like ayyankali deliberations on dalit identities were branded as casteism earlier though we had reiterated that we were speaking about democratic values kapikkad explainshistorian dr k n ganesh believes that the yathra is unlikely to create ripples in kerala as it did in the case of advanis rath yathra i dont think the sangh parivar will get a foothold in the state by drumming up support for the save sabarimala campaign there is a sizeable number of minority community members in the state and left has significant influence among hindus so it is difficult for the sangh parivar to make inroads here he says the photos of renaissance leaders are being used in the yathra as part of the sangh parivars appropriation strategy as they did in the case of gandhiji but none of the leaders supported any practice that excluded women ganesh addsthere is a public sphere in kerala which evolved through struggles over a long period we should protect the public sphere from the onslaught of the sangh parivar save sabarimala rath yathra has cleverly concealed the political intention under the garb of protection of faith pinarayi government can be ousted through a democraticallyconducted election in 2021 if people wish so but the polarisation the sangh parivar wants to bring in can be disastrous ganesh points outsreechithran m j social observer feels that

43,1617655075-192,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,What worries the BJP ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly polls,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-commentary/what-worries-the-bjp-ahead-of-the-crucial-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls/,What worries the BJP ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly polls,"March 9, 2016, 3:46 AM  IST","By Saba Naqvi
There’s a galaxy of BJP MPs from Uttar Pradesh who make news every now and then for saying outrageous things. The latest is the junior minister in the R S Katheria, MP from Agra. He recently attended a condolence meeting where speakers equated Muslims with ‘demons’ and warned of a ‘final battle’. Katheria was on record saying, “If required, we will come on the streets in thousands. Let anybody dare stop us.”
It sounds all very sinister, but it’s really just politics in India’s largest state that goes to elections a year from now. So, if one wants to be charitable to Katheria, one can see he’s already at work trying to drum up some pre-poll polarisation. And he’s hardly alone.
There’s Muzaffarnagar MP and minister of state (MoS), agriculture, Sanjeev Balyan. Also, Hamirpur MP and MoS food processing Niranjan Jyoti, earlier in the news for her ‘ramzaade vs haramzaade’ speech. Expect blockbuster returns from the likes of MP, Gorakhpur, and now mahant of Gorakhnath Temple Yogi Adityanath. Also-rans include MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj.

However, it’s getting complicated for the party that swept Uttar Pradesh off its feet in the 2014 national election. There is no good news on the economic front, for which both the central and state governments are blamed. There is an agrarian crisis, land prices are depressed and small traders are not prospering. In Bundelkhand, the poor are in the middle of droughtlike conditions.
The BJP succumbed to Jat reservation demands in Haryana not because it hopes to win over Jats in the tiny state, but because the powerful agrarian community is critical to the master plan for Uttar Pradesh 2017. Indeed, in Haryana, the party won the assembly through non-Jat support and broke with tradition when it appointed a Punjabi Khatri, Manohar Lal Khattar, as chief minister.
But in UP in 2014, Jats were the pivot of the polarisation that spread from Muzaffarnagar after the riots. Balyan is a Jat leader. Another traditional Jat leader Ajit Singh has now shaken off the dust of humiliating defeat and is expected to get into ‘an understanding’ with the Congress and the JD(U). But at this point, it’s safe to say that UP’s Jats will remain with the BJP. Not so the Dalits, a section of whom voted for the BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The Rohith Vemula episode has damaged the BJP. But what’s critical in this round is that Mayawati is seen as the rising force. At the worst of times, such as in the 2014 election when it did not manage to win a single seat, the BSP held on to 20% of the vote. Now, with law and order collapsing under SP rule, she seems the natural alternative.
In the three- (or four-)cornered assembly polls in the state, any party that touches the 29% mark in vote-share wins. The last two state polls have delivered decisive verdicts on such vote shares both for the BSP and the SP. The BJP is the third player in the fray. In UP, a typical pattern is for people to wait, and then start backing the likely winner. The SP is sliding because of a deterioration of law and order, police excesses, along with chief minister Akhilesh Yadav looking helpless in the face of the erratic statements and whimsical positions of his father and many uncles.
The BJP has its own dilemmas about projecting a chief ministerial face. The front-runner at this point is 56-year-old Manoj Sinha, a relatively unknown figure who won the Lok Sabha elections in 1996 and 1999, and then his third term in the 2014 wave. He is MP from Ghazipur and currently MoS railways. Sinha is a Bhumihar, a caste with a negligible presence in UP, but which the BJP suggests to have kinship with Brahmins, who constitute 11% of the population.
That is also the vote the Congress would be wooing if they ever get into the game. The new party strategists say they have to create ‘a political disruption’ to be in the battle. Could that possibly entail Rahul Gandhi entering the fray as a chief ministerial candidate? It sounds improbable, but UP in 2017 will also determine the chemistry for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
Meanwhile, even if the BJP goes with the relatively non-controversial Manoj Sinha, they would also have its cadre at work. Some polarising issues have already been stoked. But what’s worrying the party is that people seem more bored than galvanised by the idea of a Ram temple in Ayodhya by the end of this year.

The party represents an ideology which has always been opposed to liberal values, social reforms and women rights in the name of saving Indian culture and ethos. It had opposed Hindu Code Bill brought after independence to empower Hindu women and anti-sati law in 1987. The same ideology can be seen beating up couples on Valentine’s Day and attacking art exhibitions. In 2000, the BJP government under Rajnath Singh had banned beauty contests and fashion shows in Uttar Pradesh to ‘stop westernisation of Indian youth’. In July, Singh, now BJP national president, had described the English language as harmful to Indian culture. Recently, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, BJP’s mentor, launched a campaign to sensitize 20 crore Hindu families (around 100 crore population) against Love Jihad, an imaginary war waged by Muslims and Christians to trap and convert Hindu women and girls. However, unfortunate part is that the party is offering its regressive ideology wrapped in ‘Gujarat Model of Development’ and many are buying it unmindful of the fact that development of a human being is not about GDP and economic growth rate alone.
After Independence, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, with Nehru’s support, brought Hindu Code Bill 1951 to remove gender discrimination from Hindu society and give equal status to Hindu women. The Bill gave women inheritance, divorce and maintenance rights. It raised the age of marriage for women and upheld monogamy. The Bill brought together all the reforms such as law allowing widow remarriage and banning child marriages. However, Hindu Mahasabha, RSS and Bharatiya Jan Sangh (now BJP) severely opposed the Bill saying it would destroy the Hindu way of life and shatter the magnificent architecture of the Hindu culture. The right wing organisations also got support of some conservative leaders in the Congress. The Sangh Parivar even spread rumours that Nehru was supporting the Bill to felicitate his daughter Indira’s divorce. However, due to stiff opposition, Nehru was forced to defer the enactment, following which Ambedkar resigned in protest. Later, Nehru made Bill an election issue and won. The Bill was finally passed in 1956.
 The BJP had also opposed the Commission of Sati (prevention) Act 1987 which made commission of sati and its glorification an offence. Several BJP leaders in Rajasthan had launched a campaign against the Act saying the Sati was a part of Rajput tradition and government should not interfere in it. They argued that a woman burning herself along with husband’s body is a ‘natural act’ of devotion. The then Congress government was initially reluctant to bring a law but had to do so under public pressure and the Act was passed despite opposition. The Act was brought after Roop Kanwar, an 18-year-old young girl in Deorala village of Rajasthan was burnt alive on the funeral pyre of her husband. Many, including a couple of BJP leaders, were booked for glorifying Sati. However, all were acquitted in 2004 because of lack of evidence. The sloppy investigation and evidence collection by the police botched up the case. All eye-witnesses also turned hostile.
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi may have spoken in favour of LGBT rights but the party (after Nehru) cannot take credit of being progressive. It was Rajiv Gandhi, who as prime minister, had overturned the Supreme Court judgment in Shah Bano case in 1986. The court had ruled that a Muslim woman was entitled for maintenance from her husband after divorce under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The verdict was a milestone for Muslim women rights. However, hardliner Muslims opposed the verdict saying it is against their civil code and attack on Islam. To appease Muslim hardliners, Rajiv Gandhi government  enacted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 which nullified the court decision. The BJP described the move as Muslim appeasement and discriminatory to men of other communities, mainly Hindus. It also demanded implementation of the Common Civil Code.
Then, in order to please Hindus, Rajiv Gandhi opened locks of makeshift Ram Temple at disputed site in Ayodhya. It provided BJP an opportunity to launch a movement for construction of Ram Temple which helped party emerge as a major political force in the country. In 1988, in yet another balancing act, Rajiv Gandhi banned Salman Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses to appease Muslims and in 1989 allowed shilanyas of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. These decisions were taken by Rajiv Gandhi at a time when he was facing corruption charges. The Congress government preferred to appease fundamentalists of both the communities instead of taking a progressive and secular stand. The Congress felt that such appeasement will help in elections but it lost in 1989 and has not been able to win absolute majority in Lok Sabha since then. Had Rajiv Gandhi stood for Muslim women’s right at the first place, the country would have been saved from the communal turmoil. 
At times, double standards of the parties also confuse people. Take example of BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi who has used ‘discrimination against woman’s right to inheritance in Jammu and Kashmir’ to attack Article 370 which provides special status to the state. The ulterior motive of Modi is to communalize atmosphere in the garb of Article 370. He may say that Article 370 is responsible for the ‘separatist movement’ in Kashmir but the motive behind it is to make it an issue of India (Hindus) and Pakistan (Muslims) and evoke jingoism. One can understand it in better way by putting all the issues raised by the Sangh Parivar together. The opposition to Hindu Code Bill and anti-sati law shows its anti-women mindset. The issues like the common civil code and Article 370 appear to be nationalist but have anti-minority agenda. Stand against gay sex, valentine’s day, religious conversion, adolescence education in schools and freedom of expression in art and culture shows that the Parivar is against progressive thought and individual freedom. Adding to it are purely communal issues like construction of Ram Temple. Besides, Sangh Parivar has called upon Hindus not to adopt family planning measures. Instead, they want Hindus to increase population to counter Muslims who allegedly have plans to convert India into an Islamic country in next 100 years by increasing their population. The agenda also generates hate. Take the example of  ‘Love Jihad’. In the past two years, every incident of  harassment of a Hindu girl by a Muslim boy was described as Love Jihad to whip up communal feelings in west Uttar Pradesh. Though the reality is that harassment victims and accused belong to both the communities and there is no proof to suggest that one community is targeting another, the hate propaganda resulted in one of the worst riots in the state. The ploy is to create ‘vote bank’ by dividing people on caste and communal lines and grab surplus votes by taking about development in terms of economic growth.
 Congress’s ambivalence is equally deceptive. It promptly take up caste, lingual, regional, sectarian and communal issues in the name of social justice and development for electoral gains. Similarly, all parties claim that they want to end harassment of women and girls but most of their leaders are seen advocating a certain dress code and code of conduct for women. Similarly, their stand is ambivalent over honour killings. A law has been made against dowry but most leaders take and give dowry. The law against female foeticide is not enforced properly fearing it might upset ‘vote bank’.  The questions is not about LGBT rights alone. The larger issue is who decides in the society as to what is right and wrong – an individual or fundamentalists who are self-appointed protectors of religion and culture. Most of the time parties end up appeasing fundamentalists who claim to hold sway over public at large. Such politics restricts choice before people who are forced to elect from among corrupt and criminal fielded by parties in elections, which harms India’s assimilating culture more than anything else.

     For long you have been an anti Hindu,anti RSS,anti BJP ""progressive"" - If you are so progressive then you should find out modern day angst of China,Russia,Europe or Arab world.BJP is a party supported by majority of Hindus.If majority of Hindus have views similar to SC verdict on Homos, what should BJP do? Follow your advice?BJP is also opposed to cow slaughter and beef eating.Because Hindus are opposed to this.Reason why there is law against cow slaughter.Does this not deprive beef eating Muslims and Christians of their rights? Will you allow cow slaughter to defend the rights of beef eaters in Hindusthan?...  Read More

Let a grand temple be built at the site and a grand mosque, too, in the place allotted for its construction in Ayodhya. It is welcome that the verdict has been met with relative calm and that no organization has made any attempt to vitiate the atmosphere. The court verdict makes it clear that any attempt to demolish any other place of worship would be wholly illegal. India needs to move beyond divisive politics of identity and focus on building the internal cohesion and economic strength needed to carve out and defend its own unique space in the world and in history.

The court has based its verdict on principles that are in accordance with the secular fundamentals of the Constitution. Archaeological and other evidence have been relied upon to settle the property dispute and, simultaneously, respect the sentiments of a majority of Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the site of the Babri mosque. True, the evidence in favour of a Hindu place of worship at the site is based on preponderant probability, rather than definitive. This is cause for some disquiet, but it is difficult to imagine how else it could be. But the court recognises demolition of the mosque in 1992 as a crime and closing off of the mosque for Muslim prayer since December 1949 as unjust. It is as recompense for this injustice that the court has directed the government to allot five acres of land in Ayodhya for building a mosque. This should preclude any notion that the verdict is endorsement of the illegal destructions of the mosque. It would be ideal if a mosque were to be built with the collective effort of all communities.
It is the duty of all concerned to not just maintain peace but also to work for sustainable unity and harmony among followers of different faiths. To that end, the focus must be on the future, rather than on the past. The campaign to build a temple at Ayodhya led to much division and violence. The point is to put this firmly behind us.

It has come closely after the Supreme Court judgment on Ram temple at Ayodhya categorically stated that razing the mosque was a “criminal act”. These judgments are preceded by violence and lynchings in the name of gau raksha, and unrest owing to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. All of this has a huge bearing on the future direction of our secular democratic republic.
The Ayodhya dispute has been at the centre of Indian politics for over four decades. We are a religiously polarised nation today. But we never wanted to be a religion based nation in the first place. Ours is a land where people of diverse faiths and belief systems have coexisted for centuries.
We won independence from the British thanks to a democratic freedom struggle, in which women and men of all religious backgrounds participated equally. We, the people of India, gave ourselves the Constitution with its values of equality, justice, democracy, pluralism and equal opportunity to all. In our democracy all citizens are equal irrespective of faith, caste, gender, language.
Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, Maulana Azad and many other visionaries from the freedom struggle painstakingly laid the foundation of a plural and democratic nation. So, what went wrong? How did we reduce ourselves to being mere Hindus and Muslims?

Even as our society has been diverse and eclectic, forces of religious division and hatred have always existed amongst both Hindus and Muslims. The two nation theory was actively pursued by these forces. Jinnah wanted Pakistan and there were those who wanted a Hindu rashtra.
The outcome was a bloody Partition with loss of innocent lives and mindless violence. The Father of the Nation was assassinated because of his insistence on sarva dharma samabhava and Hindu-Muslim unity.
Most ordinary Indians wanted peace and prosperity then and they want it now, as well. Some elite Muslims, mainly from north India, migrated to Pakistan. The majority of Indian Muslims rejected the theocratic nation of Pakistan and stayed back in their own country. But the Hindu right still holds Indian Muslims responsible for the creation of Pakistan.
After Independence, even as we embarked on nation building through various development initiatives, communal politics continued to form the backdrop. The Congress brand of secularism translated into pandering to conservative Muslim leaders such as the Shahi Imam, or other such religious figures. This kind of secularism did not translate into better living conditions for Muslims who got marginalised politically, economically and socially.
On the other hand, this pandering to orthodox religious leaders gave rise to the “appeasement of Muslims” theory of BJP-RSS. On their part, even today they do not give tickets to Muslims in elections.
Congress appeasement of Muslim conservatives during the Shah Bano case helped RSS build up the Ram Janambhoomi movement. Thousands of lives were lost in the communal riots that followed countrywide. The Muslim masses paid a heavy price for this kind of politics and continued rigidity of the clergy. The women led movement against triple talaq was a refreshing change in recent years. It was supported by all except conservative clergy and so-called secular political parties.
Could the religious polarisation over Ayodhya have been avoided? It is no more relevant to talk about so-called archaeological evidence about a mosque or a temple originally existing at the disputed site. It is now only a matter of faith turned into majoritarian politics.
Back then in the 1980s, the Muslim leadership of Shahi Imam and Syed Shahabuddin should have conceded the birthplace of Lord Ram. They failed to do so. But that does not mean that those demanding a temple can freely raze the mosque. The courts have failed to provide justice in the matter.
Ordinary people have suffered for the follies of leaders. They have paid the price for divisive hate politics for too long. Collectively, we have paid a heavy price for politics of religious division through civic unrest and disturbances. We have witnessed several communal riots since Independence – Moradabad, Meerut, Bhagalpur, Nellie, Ahmedabad, Bhiwandi, Surat, Bombay, Muzaffarnagar, Delhi, the list is unending.
All Indians, including Muslims, want education, jobs, affordable housing, health services and an opportunity to flourish. Everybody wants safety and security to live and move freely. Everybody wants to enjoy individual freedoms without worrying about politics over places of worship. Nobody wants public discourse to be dominated by religious issues at the cost of real issues affecting people.
Indians are an eclectic mix of casual religiosity, agnosticism, spiritualism or even  secularism and deep religiosity. It does not mean that they hate those from other faith systems and want their subjugation. Our political parties need to understand this.
The PM talked about sabka saath, sabka vishwas. But we are yet to see any further movement on this count. Everybody is happy to see a Ram temple at Ayodhya. But it is not going to resolve the crisis faced by the nation on the economic front or the agrarian front.
We have seen a blatant attempt to falsely give a communal colour to the fight against Covid recently. Such politics is not going to lead India into the future. The CBI court verdict is a deeply ominous pointer for the future direction of our vibrant nation.

The Urban Muslims, the likes of Javed Akhtaar, Shabana Aazmi, Irfan Habib and company have a simple strategy to further that agenda... !! ... They work in the garb of being Atheists, leftist liberals ...  lecture the Hindus of India to smoke the pot of secularism, liberalism etc. while the Musalmaans under the leadership of the Mullahs would quietly press on with their agenda of capturing Hindustan, without firing a single bullet, by quietly increasing their population through whatever means ... !! ... They consider the revival of Hindu nationalism as a mortal threat...

Alas, Nehru simply ignored his view ... and see the results today, 73 years later ... the demography of India is systematically being altered ... the future generations of Hindus are looking at the same threats of the 1947 bloody massacres again ...!! ...

indian politics for over four decades we are a religiously polarised nation today but we never wanted to be a religion based nation in the first place ours is a land where people of diverse faiths and

initiatives communal politics continued to form the backdrop the congress brand of secularism translated into pandering to conservative muslim leaders such as the shahi imam or other such religious figures this kind of secularism did not translate into better living conditions for muslims who got marginalised politically economically and sociallyon the other hand this pandering to orthodox religious leaders gave rise to the appeasement of muslims theory of bjprss on their part even today they do not give tickets to muslims in electionscongress appeasement of muslim conservatives during

Not in prayer rooms, but on TV.
Seeking comfort in the certainty of the past, Indians are devouring reruns of popular Hindu religious dramas. They’re drawing on shared experiences of Indian mythology, which is replete with tales of moral and ethical choices in times of crises and invokes the virtues of individual sacrifice for social good.

The country’s public broadcaster has revived epic television shows like “Ramayan” and “Shri Krishna” _ both highly revered mythological tales _ airing them in prime time every night.
“Shri Krishna,“ a TV series originally broadcast in 1993, is an adaptation of the life of one of Hinduism’s most popular gods.
In “Ramayan,” a wildly popular series from the ’80s, filmmaker Ramanand Sagar tells the story of Lord Ram, the prince of Ayodhya, who was sent into exile for 14 years and rescued his kidnapped wife Sita from the demon Ravan.
“When the show was first telecast, the streets used to be completely deserted and everyone watched it with devotion. The stories about the victory of good over evil were very engaging,” said Vijay Kumar Jain, a physician and gastroenterologist practicing in New Delhi and an avid fan of the dramas.
On April 16, the show had a record 77 million viewers, India’s public broadcaster Prasar Bharati tweeted.
“In this era of crisp and Gen Z content, these figures clearly indicate that there is still demand for values and ethos driven content in the world’s largest democracy,“ Prasar Bharti said in a press release.
Meanwhile, on the streets, an epic but tragic drama of another kind is playing out.
Millions of poor migrant workers, hungry and in despair, have walked from cities to their villages after India’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown took away their jobs and left them to fend for themselves.
With India’s virus caseload at more than 126,000, the economy is beginning to reopen with some restrictions. But the anxiety over what lies ahead is running high.
“Showing majoritarian mythologicals when a diverse country faces a human crisis of unparalleled scale may create an illusion of wellness,“ filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee wrote in the Indian Express newspaper.
“In the midst of a pandemic that levels all, the chosen and the downtrodden, many of us fantasize about a return to a golden, simple past,“ he wrote.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often invoked Hindu scriptures in his speeches during the lockdown, asking people to do their duty and follow social distancing rules to win the battle against COVID-19.
“There is no bigger force than our enthusiasm and conviction. There is nothing we can’t achieve,” Modi said in a national address on April 3 , taking inspiration from a verse in the Hindu epic “Ramayan.”
A court verdict last year paved the way for building a grand Ram temple on a site in northern India where Hindu hard-liners demolished a 16th-century mosque in 1992, sparking deadly religious riots.
But faith transcends the politics of strident Hindu nationalism, and millions of moderate, practicing Hindus keep idols of Ram in their homes for daily prayer.
“In today’s uncertain times, people are trying to make sense of their lives _ who am I, what is my place in the universe,“ said Jain. “And mythology offers us truth and wisdom.”

A stumbling block in implementing the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment was the three-way partition of the land between three claimants and none of them willing to cede any claim to the others. Even if the Supreme Court judgment restores the land to the Sunni Waqf Board as reparation for the demolition of Babri Masjid, the board’s amenability to give away the land to pro-Mandir groups holds the promise of peace.
The compensation sought by the Sunni Waqf Board for yielding ground is also entirely reasonable. It wants the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991, that forbade the conversion of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, upheld so that all other mandir-masjid disputes end. The board also sought permission to construct a mosque at an alternate site, repair and restoration of old Ayodhya mosques, and opening up of select ASI-managed mosques for prayers. This is an opportunity to reset Hindu-Muslim ties, heal old wounds and achieve a fresh beginning at Ayodhya.
The mediation, which involved two of these parties – Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board – must cross one more hurdle. The third side with a major say – the VHP-backed Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas which advocates the cause of the deity Ram Lalla – had stayed away. Even the Sunni Waqf Board is facing pushback from the influential Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. But given the generous terms on offer and the larger good that can be achieved, it is inconceivable that those taking the name of God would baulk at this once in a lifetime opportunity for regaining peace.
The actions of the Nirvani Akhara and Aurobindo Ashram offering land in Ayodhya – to set up a national institute for social harmony – give a glimpse of the redemptive possibilities in store for the ancient temple town. Ayodhya’s enormous potential on India’s pilgrimage tourism circuit has been overshadowed by the unsettled disputes and communal wrangling. The Supreme Court deserves credit for persisting with its idea of mediation amid raucous courtroom scenes. Its judgment, slated for pronouncement next month, must seal one of independent India’s most unhappy disputes.

     The mediation effort is irrelavent in totality at this stage.  This is to give excuse to honourable court and brether to political parties. The Mediation effort cannot succeed when parties involved are not working on logic but on faith of their religion. Religion can mobilise mass but cannot provide solution. Solurion can only be provided with court judgement but this requires strong will of people against the wishes of political parties beyond their apprpach of votebank poltics. People have to repect sentiments of other religion. The invaders to this  country coming from  uncivilised and developing society were actually concured by far advanced indian society which can be seen by burning of great indian universities like taxshila, nalanda and vikramshila. But the greatness of this society came up with name of railway  station in Bihar was named Baktiyarpur under whose leadership Nalada was burnt. This society got upliftment when Aligarh  universoty was established by Muslims. The influence of indian and western civilisation after establishment of British rule india gave some boost to Muslim ideology. But present day of votebank poltics in the name of minority appeasement is not allowing community to develop. This point was brought here because what is proposed in mediation is special provision for  their worship place which gives hint for insecurity and no permanent settlement can be achieved without open mind. Here the issue of uniform civil codr for every citizen of this country is essential. Tha abolition of article 370 is being praised and considered as historical blunder by previous government but how about other provision of Aricles preventing uniformity in country including fights for increase in reservation quota. It is also not understood by media propogating anti Pakistan image and problems faced by our neighbour country. When we have problem of hunger, unemployment, looting of public  money by big business houses in the name of loan and the NPA of banks. Our media even during state elections are not deliberating issues of unemployent, filthy leaving conditions but Rastrawad against Pakistan which is totally irrevant in present context.  Indians have to come out minority appeasement and votebank politics and look for uniformity, socialially to prosper in future....  Read More

49,1617655324-252,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The view from Ayodhya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-headline/the-view-from-ayodhya/,The view from Ayodhya,"October 2, 2010, 7:03 PM  IST","Within twenty minutes of the Allahabad High Court pronouncing its verdict the martial monks of the Nirmohi Akhara pulled themselves away from the lone television set in their grimly austere quarters and poured out into the little by-lane that frames the idyllic but miniature square in the mouldering heart of Hanuman Garhi barely 500 meters from the disputed site. Almost fearful of waking the resident deity, the ‘guardians of the faith’ talked in hushed tones. The vermillion tilaks imprinted on their foreheads glowed with a divine incandescence as they caught the fading rays of the setting autumnal sun. Each tightly knit group was organised according to a strict hierarchy. But even in the recesses where light had long been cannibalised by intruding shadows it was clear to see that the more sagely older monks were distinctly restrained. They knew better than to exult over what has been widely interpreted as a favourable verdict for the votaries of the Ram temple. After all, had they not already once before allowed themselves to be swept up by the noxious wind sown by the saffron fringe for the sole purpose of reaping the political whirlwind? And what did it get them – that moment when blinded by bigotry they tore down the Babri Masjid – except perhaps for lingering regret at having strayed from the cherished pacifism of their Lord Protector Ram?
Indeed, as paradoxical as it may sound, there was no widespread jubilation at the High Court’s verdict amongst the litigants and their supporters in Ayodhya. There was just sullenness. Mahant Gopal Das, the head priest of the Ram Janambhoomi complex, sulkily pointed out that the verdict, even an unfavourable one, would have made no difference to the average believer in Ayodhya. A court after all could not adjudicate on a matter of faith. The mahant’s view is in fact widely accepted in Ayodhya. Several residents told this correspondent, before and after the verdict, that by wading into an issue that was essentially seen as a matter of faith the courts had not just blurred the lines between State and Church, but also set an unwanted precedent: Will the courts now also adjudicate over Kashi and Mathura?
        
On the ghats of the swollen Saryu river, Pandas in white dhotis went about the daily aarti with trademark indifference to the talk that had cloaked Ayodhya like a fugue. It was only after the rituals were over and only after they had cast the customary diya laden with the prayers of the faithful into the turbid waters of the Saryu that one particularly accomplished Panda chose to disengage and speak to this correspondent at length.
 
He was particularly taken by what he thought was the court abdicating its principal responsibility. Leaning close into my face so his voice won’t carry downwind, he gravely said that instead of settling the title suit squarely in favour of one contesting party the court had been seduced by the insidious charms of demagoguery. The judges, he said, were supposed to rule on who owned the title to the land instead they had shirked the question focusing on the disingenuous and impracticable solution: Divide the land.
 
Many jurists feel that the High Court’s verdict should be lauded because it shows ‘judicial statesmanship as no one is a complete loser or a complete winner.’ In Ayodhya, that reasoning is dismissed morbidly as ‘escapism’. ‘We have only one house, they have several, how can anyone, even the judges in all their wisdom expect us to give it up. Where will we go?’ remarked a particularly philosophical sadhvi. 
The reasoned response by Ayodhya’s citizenry is being confused for restraint. Actually, both communities are in a state of suspended animation, not knowing how to react to a verdict that has left them feeling cheated. The members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the pro-temple litigants this correspondent spoke too are essentially maximalists. Both view the dispute as a zero-sum-game and both want to move the Supreme Court in the hope that they are solely awarded the title to the disputed site. This is why a perfectly reasonable judgement that seeks to reward both communities has not brought closure. In fact it has prompted more questions.
The Muslims want to know why they have been robbed of their rights and how the spiritual arguments of the majority community could have been converted into legal entitlement. And it is also for this reason the Hindus wonder why has, despite declaring the disputed site as the birthplace of Lord Ram, the court upheld the rights of the Muslims which they won through force four hundred years ago.
     
It makes one sad to think that Ayodhya hasn’t really moved on; it has just decided to put its future on hold while it can contemplate the unreasonable possibilities that will bring it an imagined deliverance.

     Cherished pacifism of Lord Ram? Lord Ram destroyed hundreds of evil-doers, most notably Taraka, Khar, Dushana, Kumbhakaran, and Ravana. He gave Ravana an ultimatum --- return Sita or face destruction. He was not like our present secular pacifists, who would have tried to discover the 'root causes' of Ravan's behaviour, or wondered if killing thousands of asuras to recover Sita was 'excessive force'.  Nor did he ponder over the matter for 60 years, like our courts! If more of our leaders displayed the military decisiveness of Lord Rama, India would be a better place....

with a divine incandescence as they caught the fading rays of the setting autumnal sun each tightly knit group was organised according to a strict hierarchy but even in the recesses where light had long been cannibalised by intruding shadows it was clear to see that the more sagely older monks were distinctly restrained they knew better than to exult over what has been widely interpreted as a favourable verdict for the votaries of the ram temple after all had they not already once before allowed themselves to be swept up by the noxious wind sown by the saffron fringe for the sole purpose of reaping the political whirlwind and what did it get them – that moment when blinded by bigotry they tore down the babri masjid – except perhaps for lingering regret at having strayed from the cherished pacifism of their lord protector ramindeed as paradoxical as it may sound there was no widespread jubilation at the high courts verdict amongst the litigants and their supporters in ayodhya

philosophical sadhvi the reasoned response by ayodhyas citizenry is being confused for restraint actually both communities are in a state of suspended animation not knowing how to react to a verdict that has left them feeling cheated the members of the all india muslim personal law board and the protemple litigants this correspondent spoke too are essentially maximalists both view the dispute as a zerosumgame and both want to move the supreme court in the hope that they are solely awarded the title to the disputed site this is why a perfectly reasonable judgement that seeks to reward both communities has not brought closure in fact it has prompted more questionsthe muslims want to know why they have been robbed of their rights and how the spiritual arguments of the majority community could have been converted into legal entitlement and it is also for this reason the hindus wonder why has despite declaring the disputed site as the birthplace of lord ram the court upheld the rights

50,1617655419-275,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ram Mandir verdict could heal historical wounds of Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/ram-mandir-verdict-could-heal-historical-wounds-of-hindus/,Ram Mandir verdict could heal historical wounds of Hindus,"November 30, 2019, 11:37 PM  IST","On November 9, 2019, a special bench of Supreme Court decided unanimously that the disputed site of 1,500 square yards in Ayodhya belongs to deity Ramlalla Virajman, and paved the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple.

Since then the decision has been portrayed by some commentators as victory of faith and belief over facts, evidence and rule of law. It is alleged that culprits who unleashed violence and desecrated a religious place have been rewarded by SC, and the verdict compromises the secular character of the Indian legal system which decided the title in favour of Hindus — placing reliance on their faith.

To begin with, it is incorrect to claim that this decision is based on Hindu faith in the site known as ‘Ramjanmabhoomi’. Reliance on faith and belief of Hindus has been considered by the court to draw an inference as to the sustainability of their claim for the title: an inference from the domain of faith is inevitable to adjudicate upon such claims where the very nature of dispute is based on centuries of practise and belief.

<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-129897"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ayodhya-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""635"" height=""396"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ayodhya-2.jpg 635w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ayodhya-2-300x187.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ayodhya-2-52x32.jpg 52w"" sizes=""(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"">

This solidifies into faith, thereby ‘transforming’ into a kind of evidence corroborating the possession. It is the continuous, unchallenged and exclusive possession of the outward courtyard along with the struggle and claim for the inner one, which on preponderance of probabilities, won the case for Ramlalla and not belief and faith of Hindus.

Contrarily, failure of the Sunni Waqf board to show any dedication of Waqf by Babur or to establish adverse possession by exclusive and unchallenged control of premises led them to lose the case. Any physical structure (“disputed structure”) over a piece of land cannot fetch you a title over that land and the Muslim parties failed to show dedication and prove the alternative argument of adverse possession. However, a section of opinion-makers, with a perpetually dissatisfied “liberal and secular” conscience, have floated a narrative seeking to delegitimise the verdict, as the SC failed to deliver the outcome they desired. This needs to be repudiated.
It is an established fact that the history of India has been tainted with bloodshed caused by invaders. Attacks on glorious Hindu temples, deliberate vandalisation of idols were characteristics of such assaults. Mosques on Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath in Benaras and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura are nothing but conclusive proof of historic injustices against the Hindu civilisation. Jagannath Temple in Puri and Somnath Temple in Gujarat have faced such massive repeated destruction, the fear of which has led to restrictions on the entry of non-Hindus. Therefore, it is very important for the idea of India to heal these wounds.

Skyscrapers of Indian secularism cannot be allowed to stand on the desecrated symbols of our culture and faith. It is of utmost importance to undo these wrongs against Hindus which stand with several other historical injustices. Is it not true that the Indian Constitution and courts have paved the way for correcting injustices against Dalits by carving out an exception regarding equality in Articles 15 and 16? Is it not true that the past wrongs against blacks have been sought to be undone by amending laws in the West? Is it not true that voices of justice have been raised for ‘aborigines’ across the globe? Is it untrue that the same intellectuals who compel Hindus to forget injustices — rather claim they never happened — demand reparation from imperialists for their policies? In this light, there is nothing wrong with Hindus seeking restoration of their cultural symbols, which will heal the wounds inflicted in the past by invaders.
This decision of the Supreme Court has for the first time corrected a historical wrong against the faith and beliefs of Hindus that the 1,500 square yards in Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Ram. It did so on evidence and in accordance with legal principles. Therefore, this is not the time to blame the court and attribute motives. Some self-proclaimed intellectuals who misled the entire country and pursued the cause of an invader who erected a structure on the ruins of a un-Islamic one need to introspect.
This decision provides solace to the Hindu civilisation from wounds inflicted by religious fanatics. Hopefully, it will be a new precedent where there is a collective responsibility for such past wrongs and an effort to undo them at the earliest.

     This article is a SLAP on the face of anti-BJP, pseudo-secular, â  intellectual fraudstersâ   who lack the spine to criticise Islam and its bigoted followers but are quick to find flaws (even â  imaginedâ   ones) in Hindu matters. These sick people do not even have the guts to say that the UP Sunni Waqf board should have withdrawn from the Ajodhya case, instead of, making a prestige issue out of a Mosque built on a Hindu temple. These perverted â  intellectual fraudstersâ   (kept as â  pet animalsâ   by the Times media) have even gone to the extent of questioning the intent of independent Institutions like the SC and the Army, just because their decisions did not satisfy the false narratives of these spineless, pseudo-seculars. Finally, this article is just an exception to those â  false narrativesâ   and it does not signify any change in the mind-set of the pseudo-secular Times media whose TV channels is strangely pro-BJP!...

Given the subsequent BJP-led agitation and lengthy legal dispute, there’s no way politics and religion can be kept apart during this seminal event, to be attended by dignitaries led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. But this is also the moment to recognise that devotion to Lord Rama must dominate in the spiritual, religious and personal spheres, while politics branches off for other constructive pursuits.
Opposing parties in the decades-old litigation like Iqbal Ansari have signalled reconciliation. Reviving the spirit of harmony was also the central message in Supreme Court’s verdict that granted Hindus the disputed land but denounced the mosque’s demolition as a criminal act. The verdict’s acceptance offers hope that the brief rupture in India’s civilisational fabric can be repaired with political parties and communities coming together for preserving communal amity. After all, the Awadh region where Ayodhya is located is famed for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, the metaphorical coming together of Hindu and Muslim religious and cultural elements to evolve a distinct syncretism.
Today, BJP dominates the political landscape of north India after subordinating religious and caste identities to its advantage. The onus is now on the party and its sangh affiliates to also embrace and reinforce the message of reconciliation. It must shed bitterness and move on past other communal disputes. India is now at a crossroads where it must focus all energies on development and economic progress, instead of frittering them away in pointless identity wars.
The Covid-forced constraints on the grand groundbreaking ceremony – which at another time would have drawn huge milling crowds – is a sober reminder of critical unfinished tasks. Public health needs a reset. China has grabbed slices of Indian territory and is refusing to move out. In this backdrop, too much Hindutva triumphalism and politicisation of religious differences will not only disrupt internal social cohesion and unity, it will also hinder India’s ability to join an incipient strategic alliance of secular democracies to counter Chinese expansionism. Ramayana reveals Rama as an astute coalition builder against Ravana. As the Ram Mandir is consecrated, some contemporary parallels are very hard to miss.

     The usual mischievous editorial. First, no need to give Rajiv Ghandy any credit for Ram Janmabhumi. He had no interest in supporting the temple. He was desperate for support because of being neck deep in corruption. He also had to balance the situations due to the Shah Bano episode where he ended up hurting Muslim women. It was the usual dirty politics of the Congress. Even now, Rahul Ghandy and Priyanka Vadra have suddenly (and laughably) become Ram bhakts. PM Modi has always been about treating all Indians equally. Finally, Hindus are able to recover some of their looted heritage. Hindus across castes are uniting and supporting BJP and not being subordinated as claimed by the editors. The Ram Mandi will bring together Indians like never before. The Congress is once again desperate to disrupt the social harmony while it also colludes with China and Pakistan. However, nothing matters today as we celebrate the building of Ram Mandir across all of India and many parts of the world. Jai Shri Ram!...  Read More

52,1617655049-187,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Let’s talk ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/haldighatitohospitality/let-s-talk-vasudhaiva-kutumbakam/,Let’s talk ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’,"October 19, 2010, 7:56 PM  IST","Over two weeks after the three-member bench of the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict in the Ayodhya title suit, the stage is set for another round of litigation, with both Nirmohi Akhara and All India Muslim Personal Law Board deciding to appeal against the HC verdict in the apex court.
An appeal in the apex court was expected as the parties concerned had expressed their displeasure soon after the verdict was announced. Moreover, rarely is a court verdict in India accepted in toto, much less the verdict on the Ayodhya dispute.
However, the ongoing debate pursuant to the court order among the country’s experts and intellectuals, who might not be called partisan by any means, gives a new dimension to the entire issue.
Authors like Ramchandra Guha and Gurcharan Das have in their recent write-ups, highlighted, how India lives in two centuries, 15th and 21st, at the same time. While highlighting the simultaneity of Indian lives, the two experts
have drawn inferences (at least to my understanding) that although India is marching ahead, centuries-old historical facts continue to haunt or impact the nation. Guha had written about the unique identification number given to the first Indian by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi the same day the Allahabad Court gave its verdict.
However, the mention of “India living in two centuries at one time” shows how the past continues to haunt the present generations and a remedy seems a remote possibility.
Other issues have also cropped up: how the court-mandated trifurcation will take place and the court order might set a precedence for other disputed structures meeting the same fate.The irony is that the court order has largely been perceived with a sense of apprehension so far and very few have spared a thought for a possible “mantra” for cordial coexistence of the two communities, embodying the spirit of “vasudhaiva kutumbakam.” In fact, the concept of ""vasudhaiv kutumbakam"" was first mentioned in “Hitopadesha”, a collection of Sanskrit fables in prose and verse written by Narayan in 12th century AD.
In stead of delving deep into anecdotes, searching for genesis of perennial disputes, it will be better, if we start exploring viable possibilities which may resolve other identical disputes too. From sufi saints to ""atheists"" like Kabir, all laid emphasis on coexistence of Hindus and Muslims. They had their followers from both the communities and their teachings always spoke about peace and communal harmony.
In stead of reminiscing invasions, constructions over razed structures and other such inferences which might rub salt to the wound, modern-day historians, authors and other experts need to highlight deeds, events of the past, which could work as remedies to controversies like the Ayodhya land dispute. And, the “living simultaneously in two centuries” thesis could become more meaningful if a few centuries-old practices of religious harmony retaining their relevance even today could be cited. 
However, it will be a daunting task, given the fact that the followers of Kabir and sufis have turned a microscopic minority, whereas  religious bigots continue to call the shots.

     Kabir and other suffis were important when the country was not divided on the basis of religion.Once the country is specifically is divided on the basis of Religion and Muslim got their share of Land on both sides of India, after Mahatma/ Nehru / jinnah and many others signed on the dotted lines of Partition, Muslims should have no rights to claim our religious places- proved by historical facts- as their own.These issues which are haunting the peace of this country, have all come up and will continue to come up because of Congress and its leaders like Nehru onwards. These Congress Leaders will continue to compromise even on the integrity of this nation for their vote bank politics.Babri Mosque/ Gyan Vapi Mosque and other many such mosques which even do not confer the Islamic tenets and blot on the Hindu Majority, should be handed over the monorities to Hindus to maintain a better coordial relaions in the two main communities of the country....

with a sense of apprehension so far and very few have spared a thought for a possible mantra for cordial coexistence of the two communities embodying the spirit of vasudhaiva kutumbakam in fact the concept of vasudhaiv kutumbakam was first mentioned in hitopadesha a collection of sanskrit fables in prose and verse written by narayan in 12th century adin stead of delving deep into anecdotes searching for genesis of perennial disputes it will be better if we start exploring viable possibilities which may resolve other identical disputes too from sufi saints to atheists like kabir all laid emphasis on coexistence of hindus and muslims they had their followers from both the communities and their teachings always spoke about peace and communal harmonyin stead of reminiscing invasions constructions over razed structures and other such inferences which might rub salt to the wound modernday historians authors and other experts need to highlight deeds events of the past which could work as remedies to controversies like the ayodhya land dispute and the living simultaneously in two centuries thesis could become more meaningful if a few centuriesold practices of religious harmony retaining their relevance even today could be cited however it will be a daunting task given the fact that the followers of kabir and sufis have turned a microscopic minority whereas  religious bigots

53,1617655257-235,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Where are the spiritual experts?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/LettersfromLondon/where-are-the-spiritual-experts/,Where are the spiritual experts?,"October 11, 2010, 10:31 AM  IST","I’ve taken a few deep breaths, aligned my chi, and decided that this week, I can’t be bothered to be angry even though I find a dozen subjects I could be furious about every time I turn on the news or open a newspaper. The CWG continues to lurch from bad to worse and worser, an Allahabad High Court decides where God lives, and carves up his (or her) backyard like it’s some dodgy piece of disputed real estate. In Washington, world powers are back to petty squabbling, never mind the chilling recession that showed just how dangerous it is to play a national game in a global economy. 
Oh, well. Let’s take CWG first. It’s now moved from the realm of sports and politics to high farce, worthy of a Charlie Chaplin or Marx brothers. I sense people in India trying very hard to look on the ‘positive’ aspects of the Games. Considering it’s the most expensive CWG ever, and the money has come out of taxpayers’ pockets, it makes sense to try and squeeze whatever little joy we can out of the event. 
It might be more fun to treat the whole saga as an extended comedy show, with lots of banana skins, snake oil salesmen and whitewash buckets lying around. Not to mention plumbing disasters. Besides, everyone else in the world is having enormous amounts of fun, laughing their heads off. You may not like it, you may fulminate about ‘western’ prejudices, but well, that’s the universal nature of comedy. 
Maybe the government should make some money selling the movie rights to someone like Sacha Baron Cohen — whoever buys it won’t even need a scriptwriter. Every gag in the book is already there. 
Of course, the other big event of last week was the Ayodhya verdict. Mostly, the whole thing goes about six miles over my head. I’ve never quite figured out whether the court was supposed to rule on a disputed title deed to a piece of prime real estate, or decide about God’s location. 
If I remember my ACKs correctly, we’re talking here about Ram, the prince of Ayodhya (or God, person, Avatar, historical/mythological persona, whatever you choose) who chose to disappear into a forest rather than fight a legal battle for his inheritance and property with his brother. I wonder what he’d think about all this squabbling over his birthplace and his wife’s kitchen. If I again recall correctly, his wife did most of her cooking in various forests. 
I’m thinking now, can the Allahabad High Court locate my favourite divinity if I just filed a case? Then we could all skip the bits about praying, being good, believing, etc and just give the address to the nearest taxi driver. 
When exactly did the judiciary take on the role of spiritual guide? Of course, the other completely curious bit about the whole judgment issue was something I kept looking for and didn’t find in the reams of media coverage. Where were the experts? As in the archaeological experts, religious scholars, historians, the kind of people who spend lives studying ancient scriptures and write treatises and books on them? Am I to believe that in a country like India, there are no scholars who know about this 1,500 year-old site, both from the Hindu and Islamic perspectives? 
I looked it up. It appears the Archeological Survey did file a report in 2003 or something. But there isn’t anything much about what was in it, and how it influenced the final verdict. There’s a huge difference between contemporary religious leaders and scholars. The priest, the rabbi, the imam or chaplain is not supposed to be a scholarly expert — their job is to nurture the faith and lead the contemporary faithful. I’m assuming that the court did listen to various such experts for all these years while they were making up their minds. How come we don’t get to know what they said? 
As has been usual in the course of Indian history, I expect I’ll have to wait until someone in Oxford or Harvard writes a book about all of this. From what I could make out, the ASI report pointed to enormous historical, archaeological and possibly religious riches, not on the site but under it. But that again, we’ll never get to know, not with everyone building temples and mosques or whatever on top. Again.

54,1617655246-232,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"Bapu, Hinduism and saffron terror",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Introspection/bapu-hinduism-and-saffron-terror/,"Bapu, Hinduism and saffron terror","September 30, 2010, 9:21 AM  IST","First the ‘saffron terror’ controversy, then the Kashmir unrest and now the verdict on the Ayodhya dispute. The saffron brigade couldn’t have asked for more. All three factors (mis)used by the brigade for years to (mis)lead Hindus have been dropped in their lap one after another in the last one month. The question is, will the saffron extremists be able to whip up communal frenzy again or Hindus will live up to the real spirit of Hinduism?
Saffron voices are seeking to assure the nation of peace and harmony after the verdict but whisper campaigns and rumour mongering have begun. The term ‘saffron terror’ echoed in my ears when I received an SMS ""talvaren nikal aayee hain myan se, jo virodh karega, jayega jan se…"". Educated and well placed, even those serving in MNCs, who are often seen making politically correct statements in public, in private are speaking in highly communal language, exchanging provocative SMSs and narrating tales of how in their mohallas communities have collected bricks, acid bottles and arms to meet any eventuality in the wake of the Ayodhya judgment.
I was left wondering whether I am in the India poised to become a super power by 2020 or in the 30s when saffron terror took birth as Hindu Mahasabha and othersl, rose parallel to Nazism in Germany and Fascism in Italy and the ‘terrorism’ preached by them in the name of Hindu nationalism eventually resulted in independent India’s first and biggest saffron terror attack – assassination of Mahatama Gandhi. The hands which fired at Bapu were the same which were up with slogans ‘ek dhakka aur dou…’ and ‘jo hindu hit ki baat karega, wohi desh par raj karega’ in 1989 and 1992. The same set of hands were seen brandishing swords in the 2002 Gujarat pogrom. The list is long.
The same hands are active again. And, when I heard a few teenagers in the neighbourhood also using communal jargon, it solved the riddle how Nathuram Godeses and Ajmal Kasabs are produced. In fact, Bapu’s assassin, Godse, is a fine example of how people are brainwashed by fanatic outfits, terrorist organisations and racial regimes – be it the saffron brigade or the Taliban or Herr Fuhrer – in the garb of nationalism and righteousness. No wonder, Godse during his trial, cited examples of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh to justify violence against ‘Muslim Tyranny’ and Gandhi’s assassination. The saffron brigade defends Godse by saying that the assassination of Gandhi was an act of desperation of a person grieved by the country’s partition.
These saffron outfits want to convert India into a Hindu state by driving out people of other faiths. And, they will not like to lose the opportunity which has now come  their way. I believe they can try to create problems but will not succeed. In fact, they have failed to realise that India is secular because Hindus are in a majority and most have rejected the philosophy of hatred. In majority, I include the poor man on the street and not the privileged lot for whom self-interest is of prime importance. It’s not a coincidence that a majority of terror and communal outfits are headed by highly educated (in terms of degrees and not wisdom) people. Hinduism is treated as a religion but it’s actually a fountainhead of faiths and confluence of all spiritual streams. From monism, monotheism, pantheism to polytheism and atheism – Hinduism has space for all.
The Arab invaders called the Sindhu Hindu, hence people living on the other side of the river were termed as Hindus and their different faiths were collectively termed Hinduism. If Hinduism has thrived for thousands of years, it’s because it evolved with time and flowed like a river accepting water from tributaries, not allowing the water to stagnate. Hinduism allows an individual to question its tenets and follow it only if the individual finds it convincing. An individual is free to follow the stream of his or her choice. In a family, the mother could be an idol worshipper, daughter a dualist, father a monotheist and son an atheist. A Hindu can visit the places of worship of other religions. A prayer can be offered in any format or language, even self composed.
Hinduism emphasises on duty – pita dharm, putra dharm, raj dhara… The guiding principles are ‘ekam sat vipra bahauda vadanti (truth is one, saints refer it by different names), udara charita nam tu vasudhaiva kutumbakam (An open mind considers mankind one family) and aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah (Let noble thoughts come from all directions)’. The spirit of Hinduism was in Meerabai’s revolt against a highly patriarchal society for her devotional love. It reflected in the act of emperor Humayun, who rushed to save a Hindu queen on receiving rakhi from her with a request for help against a Muslim aggressor, in the supreme sacrifice of Guru Tegh Bahadur to save Hindus from Aurangzeb’s religious terrorism. Mother Teresa’s is Hinduism personified.
Untouchability is a blot on Hinduism. But Hinduism has also produced hundreds of Dalit saints from Valmiki to Ravidas revered by all Hindus. According to the Bhagwatgita, God resides in everything in the universe, hence serving mankind and nature is the best prayer offered to the Almighty. Gandhi said ""Accept only those things from traditions which you think are right and reject practices carried out in the name of religion which are against morality. Hinduism has love of Jesus, compassion of the Buddha, non-violence of Mahavir and brotherhood of Mohammad. Ideas of Sarvodya (uplifting all) and daridra-narayan (God resides in the poor) were inspired by the Gita.
Gandhi described Hinduism as the most tolerant creed because it is non-proselytising. ""A Hindu refuses to change his religion, not because he considers the faith to be the best, but because he knows that he can complement it through the reforms. Hinduism is like the Ganga, pure and unsullied at its source, but taking in its course impurities on the way. Like the Ganga, Hinduism is beneficent in its total effect. It takes a provincial form in every province, but the inner substance is retained everywhere. Gandhi’s assassination was an attempt to terrorise the masses who identified themselves with Bapu’s thought, deed and action. It was an attack on the common man, who, though illiterate, kept alive love, tolerance and brotherhood enshrined in the works of Kabir, Sur and Tulsi.
According to Gandhian Chunibhai Vaidya (Assassination of Gandhi – The Facts Behind) Gandhi’s assassination was culmination of decades of systematic brainwashing. Beginning with 1934 over a period of 14 years on six occasions attempts were made to kill him when there was on proposal of partition, hence conspiracy to do away with Gandhiji was conceived much earlier. Poet Mohammed Iqbal gave the concept of a separate Muslims nation in 1930. and it was supported by the Hindu Mahasabha. In 1937, at Ahmedabad, Veer Savarkar in his address, asserted that India cannot be assumed to be a unitarian and homogeneous nation…there are two nations – Hindus and Muslims. In 1945, Savarkar again said that he had no quarrel with Jinnah’s two-nation theory.
While the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha advocated that Hindus and Muslims are two nations, the Congress top brass gave way to the demand in their haste to get independence and rule the country. Gandhiji made as many as 14 attempts to dissuade Jinnah. He was the last person to accept it. Vaidya also says ""Gandhiji used to say that the brahmanism that can tolerate untouchability, virgin widowhood, spoilage of virgins, stinks in his nostrils. He encouraged intercaste marriages and blessed marriages wherein one of the partners belonged to the untouchables. Vested interests amongst high-caste Hindus viewed this reformist and reforms with bitter resentment. Gradually, it developed into a phobia and Gandhiji became an anathema to them"".
The creation of Bangladesh in 1971 demolished the two-nation theory but the saffron brigade continued with its agenda. Studies reveal that of around 110 major communal riots which took place after independence, 90% were instigated by saffron extremist. Around 60% of these riots occurred between 1990 and 2009 (post-Ram temple movement). After the Babri mosque demolition in 1992, there have been 82 terror attacks in various parts of the country. The Congress is equally responsible for the communal divide in the country – be it anti-Sikh riots of 1984 or opening of Ram temple locks in Ayodhya – to grab power. In many of the riots, Congress leaders were also found to be hand in glove with saffron forces. The same brand of politics is also being followed by some regional parties.
But WE are responsible for the state of affairs. WE are in the government. WE instigate communal violence. WE take part in riots. WE indulge in terrorism. And, WE are also the victims. If Hindus need to understand and live up to the real spirit of Hinduism, Muslims also need to introspect – Why the world is in the grip of Islamophobia, why minorities are oppressed in Islamic countries and is pan-Islamism a hurdle in unity with people of other faiths? Undoubtedly, Muslims have contributed and sacrificed for the country before and after independence. But we still need an extra effort from Muslims to nullify the effect of ‘historical’ reasons and Hindu oppression in neighbouring Islamic countries because saffron terror uses it as its excuse.
The country faces another challenge after the Ayodhya verdict. But before forming any opinion or allowing ourselves to be swayed by the frenzy, imagine the plight of one lakh Kashmiri pandits living a miserable life in refugee camps for the last 20 years after being driven out from their home by terrorists. Feel the pain of Bilkis Bano, who was just 20 years old when during the Gujrat carnage 14 members of her family were butchered, three-year-old daughter killed by smashing her head on a stone and she (also six months old pregnant then) was ganged-raped along with her mother and cousin. And, take lesson from Gladys Stein, who has forgiven saffron terrorists who burnt alive her husband, Graham, an Australian missionary, along with two sons in Orissa in 1999.
Remember, Gandhi said ""Truth quenches untruth. Love quenches anger, self-suffering quenches violence."" and   ""Hatred ever kills, Love never dies, What is obtained by love is retained for all time, What is obtained by hatred proves a burden, for it increases hatred.""

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",first the saffron terror controversy then the kashmir unrest and now the verdict on the ayodhya dispute the saffron brigade couldnt have asked for more all three factors misused by the brigade for years to mislead hindus have been dropped in their lap one after another in the last one month the question is will the saffron extremists be able to whip up communal frenzy again or hindus will live up to the real spirit of hinduismsaffron voices are seeking to assure the nation of peace and harmony after the verdict but whisper campaigns and rumour mongering have begun the term saffron terror echoed in my ears when i received an sms talvaren nikal aayee hain myan se jo virodh karega jayega jan se… educated and well placed even those serving in mncs who are often seen making politically correct statements in public in private are speaking in highly communal language exchanging provocative smss and narrating tales of how in their mohallas communities have collected bricks acid bottles and arms to meet any eventuality in the wake of the ayodhya judgmenti was left wondering whether i am in the india poised to become a super power by 2020 or in the 30s when saffron terror took birth as hindu mahasabha and othersl rose parallel to nazism in germany and fascism in italy and the terrorism preached by them in the name of hindu nationalism eventually resulted in independent indias first and biggest saffron terror attack – assassination of mahatama gandhi the hands which fired at bapu were the same which were up with slogans ek dhakka aur dou… and jo hindu hit ki baat karega wohi desh par raj karega in 1989 and 1992 the same set of hands were seen brandishing swords in the 2002 gujarat pogrom the list is longthe same hands are active again and when i heard a few teenagers in the neighbourhood also using communal jargon it solved the riddle how nathuram godeses and ajmal kasabs are produced in fact bapus assassin godse is a fine example of how people are brainwashed by fanatic outfits terrorist organisations and racial regimes – be it the saffron brigade or the taliban or herr fuhrer – in the garb of nationalism and righteousness no wonder godse during his trial cited examples of chhatrapati shivaji rana pratap and guru gobind singh to justify violence against muslim tyranny and gandhis assassination the saffron brigade defends godse by saying that the assassination of gandhi was an act of desperation of a person grieved by the countrys partitionthese saffron outfits want to convert india into a hindu state by driving out people of other faiths and they will not like to lose the opportunity which has now come  their way i believe they can try to create problems but will not succeed in fact they have failed to realise that india is secular because hindus are in a majority and most have rejected the philosophy of hatred in majority i include the poor man on the street and not the privileged lot for whom selfinterest is of prime importance its not a coincidence that a majority of terror and communal outfits are headed by highly educated in terms of degrees and not wisdom people hinduism is treated as a religion but its actually a fountainhead of faiths and confluence of all spiritual streams from monism monotheism pantheism to polytheism and atheism – hinduism has space for allthe arab invaders called the sindhu hindu hence people living on the other side of the river were termed as hindus and their different faiths were collectively termed hinduism if hinduism has thrived for thousands of years its because it evolved with time and flowed like a river accepting water from tributaries not allowing the water to stagnate hinduism allows an individual to question its tenets and follow it only if the individual finds it convincing an individual is free to follow the stream of his or her choice in a family the mother could be an idol worshipper daughter a dualist father a monotheist and son an atheist a hindu can visit the places of worship of other religions a prayer can be offered in any format or language even self composedhinduism emphasises on duty – pita dharm putra dharm raj dhara… the guiding principles are ekam sat vipra bahauda vadanti truth is one saints refer it by different names udara charita nam tu vasudhaiva kutumbakam an open mind considers mankind one family and aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah let noble thoughts come from all directions the spirit of hinduism was in meerabais revolt against a highly patriarchal society for her devotional love it reflected in the act of emperor humayun who rushed to save a hindu queen on receiving rakhi from her with a request for help against a muslim aggressor in the supreme sacrifice of guru tegh bahadur to save hindus from aurangzebs religious terrorism mother teresas is hinduism personifieduntouchability is a blot on hinduism but hinduism has also produced hundreds of dalit saints from valmiki to ravidas revered by all hindus according to the bhagwatgita god resides in everything in the universe hence serving mankind and nature is the best prayer offered to the almighty gandhi said accept only those things from traditions which you think are right and reject practices carried out in the name of religion which are against morality hinduism has love of jesus compassion of the buddha nonviolence of mahavir and brotherhood of mohammad ideas of sarvodya uplifting all and daridranarayan god resides in the poor were inspired by the gitagandhi described hinduism as the most tolerant creed because it is nonproselytising a hindu refuses to change his religion not because he considers the faith to be the best but because he knows that he can complement it through the reforms hinduism is like the ganga pure and unsullied at its source but taking in its course impurities on the way like the ganga hinduism is beneficent in its total effect it takes a provincial form in every province but the inner substance is retained everywhere gandhis assassination was an attempt to terrorise the masses who identified themselves with bapus thought deed and action it was an attack on the common man who though illiterate kept alive love tolerance and brotherhood enshrined in the works of kabir sur and tulsiaccording to gandhian chunibhai vaidya assassination of gandhi – the facts behind gandhis assassination was culmination of decades of systematic brainwashing beginning with 1934 over a period of 14 years on six occasions attempts were made to kill him when there was on proposal of partition hence conspiracy to do away with gandhiji was conceived much earlier poet mohammed iqbal gave the concept of a separate muslims nation in 1930 and it was supported by the hindu mahasabha in 1937 at ahmedabad veer savarkar in his address asserted that india cannot be assumed to be a unitarian and homogeneous nation…there are two nations – hindus and muslims in 1945 savarkar again said that he had no quarrel with jinnahs twonation theorywhile the muslim league and the hindu mahasabha advocated that hindus and muslims are two nations the congress top brass gave way to the demand in their haste to get independence and rule the country gandhiji made as many as 14 attempts to dissuade jinnah he was the last person to accept it vaidya also says gandhiji used to say that the brahmanism that can tolerate untouchability virgin widowhood spoilage of virgins stinks in his nostrils he encouraged intercaste marriages and blessed marriages wherein one of the partners belonged to the untouchables vested interests amongst highcaste hindus viewed this reformist and reforms with bitter resentment gradually it developed into a phobia and gandhiji became an anathema to themthe creation of bangladesh in 1971 demolished the twonation theory but the saffron brigade continued with its agenda studies reveal that of around 110 major communal riots which took place after independence 90 were instigated by saffron extremist around 60 of these riots occurred between 1990 and 2009 postram temple movement after the babri mosque demolition in 1992 there have been 82 terror attacks in various parts of the country the congress is equally responsible for the communal divide in the country – be it antisikh riots of 1984 or

55,1617655155-211,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ram mandir: Why Indian elites are always let down by the masses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/science-nomad/ram-mandir-why-indian-elites-are-always-let-down-by-the-masses/,Ram mandir: Why Indian elites are always let down by the masses,"November 25, 2019, 4:36 PM  IST","Unfortunately for Indian elites, Indian masses are a general pain that keep disappointing them.
During the elections, masses vote for people that elites strongly warn them against, and whenever a big change like Ram Mandir is ushered in that elites consider disastrous, masses refuse to behave the way elites hope they will.
While elite India spent years fearing Ram Mandir because it was expected to lead to “rivers of blood flowing down the streets across India”, when it arrived, the most violent images we could get were of a Hindu priest crushing his Muslim counterpart in a bear hug near the very epicentre of the once disputed site.
While elites across India are deeply disappointed with the public response to the verdict (and here the Kashmir excuse of “government clamp-down on news” is not available), for us commoners, it is a wonderful example of how ground realities have little to do with the imaginary India of elites.
The reason why elites’ world view and those of the masses don’t converge is simple, and I was fortunate to learn it first-hand during the last week in a city that has its own set of elites hoping to polarise it but failing miserably.
As an erstwhile architect, my education has made me see a lot of India, especially Mandirs, mosques and other historical places of India where the Hindu-Muslim interactions of the past have left their marks.
The most interesting part of India is that most of these places are still under active use and hence the Hindu-Muslim interactions still continue on these locations, making them worth experiencing if you really wish to understand how Indian masses respond to the here-and-now, even if it has a massive historical context.
The city that I visited with some of my architect friends once boasted riches beyond imagination and hence is littered with examples of finest Islamic architecture including a grand mosque.
When we approached this beautiful mosque oozing serenity that Spartan-ness of Islamic architecture manages with ease, we were spotted as an opportunity by a local who ushered us in and started explaining the history of the place.
As (now old) architects who have been to innumerable mosques across India as part of our education, we were enjoying the space and its history without getting uncomfortable, but as we moved forward, men were segregated and invited inside the prayer hall and soon we were asked to sit on the prayer mat and pray if we wished.
As we were respectfully trying to pass through this awkward moment (not due to any religious issue but because squatting was beyond the ken for the ageing knees), I suddenly saw a man approaching from behind armed with a smartphone capturing the video of our adventure and soon realised the source of his interest. As one of my friends was having a camera in his hand, it was clear that the man wanted to have a proof of us having violated the sanctity of the mosque.
Even though no photographs were taken by my friend, to me, it looked like a situation pregnant with not too many pleasant possibilities. But, while I was forming arguments to escape an ugly scene that I anticipated in my mind, the man who had brought us inside whispered to me the greatest truth spoken by one man to another.
“Sir, he wants money.”
So, while the elite in me was thinking about the repercussions of having hurt religious sentiments, the ground reality was completely different. It only about two business competitors that used a religious place as any other shop for earning their daily bread.
As our “guide” had captured “business”, his competitor just wanted to blackmail him with the proof that he was encouraging sacrilegious behaviour from visitors and have force-grab share in the pie. So, it took only a hundred rupee note to absolve us of a sin that was not even committed and we enjoyed the rest of the Mosque visit unhindered.
Be it Ayodhya or the mosque I was visiting or even Kashmir, the bigger and local truth that is far more powerful than the religious sentiments is that all these places are sources of livelihood for the locals.
We may get extremely agitated sitting thousands of miles away, on the ground, they are spaces that people use for earning a living, and any development that locals would see as augmenting to their earnings would always be welcome on the ground.
If elites of India get out of the TV studios and interact with the people on the ground, they will realise that people just want to have a better life.
For a Muslim chaiwala of Ayodhya, if the Ram Mandir will mean arrival of more tourists and increase in his income, he would be happy to join the “Mandir wahi banayenge” chant, and similarly, a Hindu guide to a Mandir would be just as happy to see increase in the flow of Muslim tourists for any reason.
The world is at peace mainly because the masses need and hence want it that way to survive and elites are better off because of it.
India has managed to pull off the miracle of secularism because masses are just busy surviving. So, it is in the benefit of the elites to leave them be and let them find their own ways to deal with religious conflicts instead of advising them.

56,1617655142-210,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Was the waiting game necessary?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/was-the-waiting-game-necessary/,Was the waiting game necessary?,"November 13, 2019, 7:18 PM  IST","Those who made a political somersault to prostrate at the feet of the Goddess of power are today questioning the Governor of Maharashtra’s decision to “rush through” the motions of imposing President’s Rule in the State. The Governor, merely did what looked inevitable to political observers, who had been observing the State closely since the day of the election results and a new emerging power play amongst pre-poll alliance partners – BJP & the Shiv Sena. After the BJP failed to form the Government and requested for extra time which was turned down by the Governor, the Governor went by the Rule Book to invite the Shiv Sena, the 2nd largest party with 56 seats, to take a shot at Government formation, even if it wasn’t with its pre-poll alliance partner.
The Shiv Sena, which has been flirting with Sharad Pawar’s NCP, within hours of election results being declared, 16t days later went to the Raj Bhawan, but without the most important letter of support from NCP and Congress in its hand. The Congress kept saying it was waiting for the NCP to make-up its mind and the ball was in Sharad Pawar’s court. Sharad Pawar couldn’t make-up his mind till the deadline ended on Monday and all the Shiv Sena could muster was request to the Governor for an extension of the deadline, which was politely turned-down, just as in the case of the BJP. Now the court will have their final say on whether it was right or wrong as the entire imbroglio will shift to the Supreme Court. But can anyone fault the Governor for lack of consistency?
The Governor perhaps need not have even invited the NCP, because, with its Pre-poll alliance partner the Congress, the NCP will only be able to offer 98 MLAs, as against the required 145 for a simple majority in the house of 288. The Shiv Sena which would have had to lend its support even to this option no. 3 with its 56 MLAs, has already exhausted its invitation for failing to muster the protocol for an alliance partnership with the NCP-Congress. Yet the Governor gave NCP the option and a deadline for 8:30 PM Tuesday evening but, when at 11:30 AM, the NCP came  back with an admission that it could not cobble-up a necessary coalition by Tuesday evening and hence needed another extension of 48 hours, surely the Governor can’t be blamed for failing to form the Government or recommending what was imminent – President’s Rule in the State.
For the record, the Governor waited a good 15 days for parties to come and stake a claim, to form the Government. It was when the BJP Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis went to offer his resignation that the Governor started the procedure the Rule Book dictates. He first gave the care-taker Chief Minister Fadnavis an opportunity formally to try and form a popular Government, as per the mandate of the people in the State on October 24th. But, within a day, Fadnavis, as the leader of the single largest party officially informed the Governor that he did not have the numbers because his pre-poll alliance partner-Shiv Sena had suddenly decided to change the rules of engagement.

Remember, 16 days have passed and not a single party had staked claim to form the Government. The Governor then exercised the most justified procedure and gave a chance to BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP a chance to form the Government and after refusing each one of the extensions, and eventually recommended President’s Rule in his report to the Ministry of Home Affairs. To those who are now questioning the Governor’s decision, there is only one question: What should he have waited for –  horse-trading? Or the largest State in India left on auto-pilot? The State of Maharashtra that contributes 3.52 lakh CR to the national exchequer, which makes up for nearly 32% of the total tax collection in India, contributes 12% to  India’s GDP, highest amongst all states, 17% of the industrial output of the country and 16% of the country’s service sector output. How long should the Governor have waited?
Let’s also look at the betrayal of the mandate as the new power equations were beginning to demonstrate. The Shiv Sena was in alliance with the BJP on the Hindutva platform. The Shiv Sena was the biggest supporter of the BJP, in their shared dream of a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, but ironically, when the Supreme Court verdict settled the 134-year-old dispute, the Shiv Sena had decided to rely on the Congress Party. The same Congress party, which has been called a “Eunuch” by Bal Thackeray-the founder of the Sena. On Sonia Gandhi’s entry into politics, he had said he would prefer handing the power to the British, ‘who at least have had the experience of ruling the country for 150 years.’
The Congress, in turn, led by its senior leader Digvijaya Singh had called the Shiv Sena  ‘A Desi Taliban’. The Congress in-turn had called the Shiv Sena a communal and extremist party. Bal Thackery had taken several digs on how India was reeling under the servitude of the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi and had said the country has no future under this “Eunuch Rule” – a term repeated by his son the present Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. And Bal Thackeray, in an interview to a television channel had this to say about Sharad Pawar-: “If politics is considered to be a game of scoundrels, it is for a man to decide whether he wants to be a gentleman or a scoundrel. If anyone wants to become a scoundrel, okay. But I will not go with a scoundrel, whoever he maybe.” But many would argue, where was the ideology of the BJP when it allied with Mufti Mohammed Sayeed’s PDP in Jammu & Kashmir? Well, the biggest difference was that Mufti Mohammed Sayeed wasn’t Mehbooba Mufti for one and, after his demise, breaking the alliance with Mehbooba would have looked churlish. In any case, both the BJP and the Congress have done business with the regional parties in Jammu and Kashmir – the PDP & the NC –  in good measure, as the state has always been treated as a special entity, and National Security ramifications of the State for the rest of India cannot be compared to Maharashtra.

For Maharashtra, the issues relate more to the people of the State at a time when as many as 8 lakh customers have been affected by the PMC bank scam, and 7 have lost their life. With 10 farmer suicides in the last 5 days and 390 firms are shutting down daily as per some reports leading to an employment crises that needs urgent attention, what should the Governor have waited for? And for how long? Would all political parties care to answer that question? What about the people of Maharashtra?

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",those who made a political somersault to prostrate at the feet of the goddess of power are today questioning the governor of maharashtras decision to rush through the motions of imposing presidents rule in the state the governor merely did what looked inevitable to political observers who had been observing the state closely since the day of the election results and a new emerging power play amongst prepoll alliance partners – bjp  the shiv sena after the bjp failed to form the government and requested for extra time which was turned down by the governor the governor went by the rule book to invite the shiv sena the 2nd largest party with 56 seats to take a shot at government formation even if it wasnt with its prepoll alliance partnerthe shiv sena which has been flirting with sharad pawars ncp within hours of election results being declared 16t days later went to the raj bhawan but without the most important letter of support from ncp and congress in its hand the congress kept saying it was waiting for the ncp to makeup its mind and the ball was in sharad pawars court sharad pawar couldnt makeup his mind till the deadline ended on monday and all the shiv sena could muster was request to the governor for an extension of the deadline which was politely turneddown just as in the case of the bjp now the court will have their final say on whether it was right or wrong as the entire imbroglio will shift to the supreme court but can anyone fault the governor for lack of consistencythe governor perhaps need not have even invited the ncp because with its prepoll alliance partner the congress the ncp will only be able to offer 98 mlas as against the required 145 for a simple majority in the house of 288 the shiv sena which would have had to lend its support even to this option no 3 with its 56 mlas has already exhausted its invitation for failing to muster the protocol for an alliance partnership with the ncpcongress yet the governor gave ncp the option and a deadline for 830 pm tuesday evening but when at 1130 am the ncp came  back with an admission that it could not cobbleup a necessary coalition by tuesday evening and hence needed another extension of 48 hours surely the governor cant be blamed for failing to form the government or recommending what was imminent – presidents rule in the statefor the record the governor waited a good 15 days for parties to come and stake a claim to form the government it was when the bjp chief minister devendra fadnavis went to offer his resignation that the governor started the procedure the rule book dictates he first gave the caretaker chief minister fadnavis an opportunity formally to try and form a popular government as per the mandate of the people in the state on october 24th but within a day fadnavis as the leader of the single largest party officially informed the governor that he did not have the numbers because his prepoll alliance partnershiv sena had suddenly decided to change the rules of engagementremember 16 days have passed and not a single party had staked claim to form the government the governor then exercised the most justified procedure and gave a chance to bjp shiv sena and ncp a chance to form the government and after refusing each one of the extensions and eventually recommended presidents rule in his report to the ministry of home affairs to those who are now questioning the governors decision there is only one question what should he have waited for –  horsetrading or the largest state in india left on autopilot the state of maharashtra that contributes 352 lakh cr to the national exchequer which makes up for nearly 32 of the total tax collection in india contributes 12 to  indias gdp highest amongst all states 17 of the industrial output of the country and 16 of the countrys service sector output how long should the governor have waitedlets also look at the betrayal of the mandate as the new power equations were beginning to demonstrate the shiv sena was in alliance with the bjp on the hindutva platform the shiv sena was the biggest supporter of the bjp in their shared dream of a ram mandir in ayodhya but ironically when the supreme court verdict settled the 134yearold dispute the shiv sena had decided to rely on the congress party the same congress party which has been called a eunuch by bal thackeraythe founder of the sena on sonia gandhis entry into politics he had said he would prefer handing the power to the british who at least have had the experience of ruling the country for 150 yearsthe congress in turn led by its senior leader digvijaya singh had called the shiv sena  a desi taliban the congress inturn had called the shiv sena a communal and extremist party bal thackery had taken several digs on how india was reeling under the servitude of the italianborn sonia gandhi and had said the country has no future under this eunuch rule – a term repeated by his son the present sena chief uddhav thackeray and bal thackeray in an interview to a television channel had this to say about sharad pawar if politics is considered to be a game of scoundrels it is for a man to decide whether he wants to be a gentleman or a scoundrel if anyone wants to become a scoundrel okay but i will not go with a scoundrel whoever he maybe but many would argue where was the ideology of the bjp when it allied with mufti mohammed sayeeds pdp in jammu  kashmir well the biggest difference was that mufti mohammed sayeed wasnt mehbooba mufti for one and after his demise breaking the alliance with mehbooba would have looked churlish in any case both the bjp and the congress have done business with the regional parties in jammu and kashmir – the pdp  the nc –  in good measure as the state has always been treated as a special entity and national security ramifications of the state for the rest of india cannot be compared to maharashtrafor maharashtra the issues relate more to the people of the state at a time when as many as 8 lakh customers have been affected by the pmc bank scam and 7 have lost their life with 10 farmer suicides in the last 5 days and 390 firms are shutting down daily as per some reports leading to an employment crises that needs urgent attention what should the governor have waited for and for how long would all political parties care to answer that question what about the people of maharashtra

57,1617655105-200,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,I want to live in a secular country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/90rollsroyces/i-want-to-live-in-a-secular-country/,I want to live in a secular country,"November 27, 2018, 1:29 PM  IST","As the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph adjourned the hearing on petitions challenging the Allahabad high court verdict in the Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid site title dispute to January 2019 I suddenly felt the need to live in a country that is truly secular.
India is no longer SECULAR…. the word introduced by Mrs. Indira Gandhi into the preamble of the constitution during the Emergency years. Surprised? Well, don’t be, we live in India.
The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution also amended the Preamble and changed the description of India from ‘sovereign democratic republic’ to a ‘sovereign, socialist secular democratic republic’. It also changed the words ‘unity of the nation’ to ‘unity and integrity of the nation’.”
My understanding of the word secular is that the government treats all religions equally and does not interfere in the running of the places of worship. In the past 20 years see what has happened in India, supposedly a Hindu-majority country… “In the last 20 years, 17500 churches, 9700 mosques and 370 temples were built.” Source – ShankNaad.
I have a problem with any new place of worship being built. I have a huge problem with the number of churches that have been built because all of a sudden, the church becomes the 4th or 5th largest land owner after the government and the armed forces. Every new church has not been the house of God but the house of incentivised conversion. Every new Mosque makes me wonder if I will have to change my way of life like all those countries where Islam rules.
I also have a couple of fundamental questions – UK is a Christian country, Germany is a Christian country, Ireland is a Christian country, Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country, China is a communist-no religion-atheist country, Afghanistan is a Muslim country, Iran and Iraq are Muslim countries, Israel is a Jewish country, Pakistan is a Muslim country, Indonesia is a Muslim country, France is a Christian country that will soon be a Muslim country, Belgium will apparently be a Muslim country by 2030…. but India HAS to be a secular country. Why? Pray why??
Second question – over the past 800 years nearly 100 million Hindus have been massacred by Islamic invaders, the Brits and then the partition. For the 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi rule, there are memorials and museums and their history is known to every Jewish child as it should be. But there is not a single memorial for this horror visited upon the Hindus !! Why? The silence is deafening.
Now take modern independent secular India – Since 1850s the place where millions of Hindus believe their God, Sri Ram, was born is under dispute because an invader called Babur built a mosque over the temple…. the invader’s family then ruled over India for hundreds of years and his great great great grandson Aurangzeb demolished another sacred temple, the Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi and built a mosque that cannot be removed…. hundreds of temples were razed to the ground and thousands of Kashmiri Pandits are driven out of their homes and the fount of Hinduism, Jammu & Kashmir while the democratic government looks on…. even more recently Christian graveyards are built next to Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu and the Sabarimalai Ayyappa temple is under threat because a Muslim gentleman goes to court to ask for women to enter the temple because he feels they are being discriminated against – so much for a secular country.
With the deferment of the Ayodhya Sri Ramjanambhoomi hearing, I feel the Supreme Court seems to have clearly told the millions of Hindus living in India that they are second class citizens in their own land. The Supreme Court never has time to listen to the Kashmiri Pandits case, the RamJanamBhoomi case, the Muslim women’s case who wanted Muslim women to enter Mosques nor the case regarding the Sikh Riots of 1984 but it always has time to listen to a terrorist’s plea to live (e.g Yakub Memon), a Muslim gentleman’s PIL interfering in a Hindu temple (Sabarimalai temple), the urban Naxals cases, the Diwali cracker pollution case year after year and Prashant Bhushan’s plea about a non-existent scam…. am no lawyer and haven’t the faintest idea of how the courts work. I truly want to believe that the Supreme Court of India is impartial, independent and delivers justice in every case and I did believe that till the top court’s decision on deferring Ayodhya hearing. Maybe the uneducated me is unjustified in feeling that the Supreme court is not impartial…. a huge blow to my trust in the august institution.
Is it time to relook at how judges and the Chief Justice are chosen? It seems a certain number of families send their boys and girls to law schools so that they may dispense justice to the teeming millions …. and I don’t remember any female Chief Justice of India. Time for one? Equality in all spheres has to be ensured. I think it is a fundamental right, but again, am not an expert on the constitution of India.
…. a deeply disturbed citizen of India.

over the temple… the invaders family then ruled over india for hundreds of years and his great great great grandson aurangzeb demolished another sacred temple the kashi vishwanath in varanasi and built a mosque that cannot be removed… hundreds of temples were razed to the ground and thousands of kashmiri pandits are driven out of their homes and the fount of hinduism jammu  kashmir while the democratic government looks on… even more recently christian graveyards are built next to hindu temples in tamil nadu and the sabarimalai ayyappa temple is under threat because a muslim gentleman goes to court to ask for women to enter the temple because he feels they are being discriminated against – so much for a secular countrywith the deferment of the ayodhya sri ramjanambhoomi hearing i feel the supreme court seems to have clearly told the millions of hindus living in india that they are second class citizens in their own land the supreme court never has time to listen to the kashmiri pandits case the ramjanambhoomi case the muslim womens case who wanted muslim women to enter mosques nor the case regarding the sikh riots of 1984 but it always has time to listen to a terrorists plea to live eg yakub memon a muslim gentlemans pil interfering in a hindu temple sabarimalai temple the urban naxals cases the diwali cracker pollution case year after year and prashant bhushans plea about a nonexistent scam… am no lawyer and havent the faintest idea of how the courts work i truly want to believe that the supreme court of india is impartial independent and delivers justice in every case and i did believe that till the top courts decision on deferring ayodhya hearing maybe the uneducated me is unjustified in feeling that the supreme court is not impartial… a huge blow to my trust in the august institutionis it time to relook at how judges and the chief justice are chosen it seems a certain number of families send their boys and girls to law schools so that they may

This would, indeed, appear to be technically correct.
Whether mosques are integral to the practice of Islam has little to do with whether the Indian State has the power to acquire the land on which a mosque stands on par with the right it has to acquire a church or a temple. The State has the power to acquire real estate, regardless of a place of worship having been constructed on it — this is the operative principle that is relevant to the Ayodhya dispute.

Whether a mosque is an integral part of Islam has little do with the question. Now that the case will be heard towards the end of the next month, is the path to an end to the Ayodhya dispute in sight? Such an expectation rests on the presumption that the court would resolve the property dispute in favour of the Hindu claimants. It is equally possible that, considered as a property dispute, the court could uphold the claim of the Wakf Board. In which case, there is no automatic resolution to the dispute.
At the core of the dispute is faith, around which there was extensive mobilisation of Hindus, based on the claim that Lord Ram was born on the site on which the mosque was built in the 16th century, with a political end. The court is not the best place to resolve disputes of faith and politics.
Politicians and religious leaders should find the courage to arrive at a solution to the dispute without dragging the court into the conflict. The court should, on its part, tell the disputants that legal concepts like adverse possession and statutes of limitation do not operate in the penumbra where history shades into myth and faith. It would be gross injustice to burden the court with a task that is not its with the added risk of sullying its secular credentials. Politicians and community leaders should take charge, instead of abdicating their responsibility

59,1617655465-287,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ayodhya verdict sends mixed signals: The good news is most political parties and groups have publicly accepted it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/ronojay-sens-blog/ayodhya-verdict-sends-mixed-signals-the-good-news-is-most-political-parties-and-groups-have-publicly-accepted-it/,Ayodhya verdict sends mixed signals: The good news is most political parties and groups have publicly accepted it,"November 11, 2019, 8:41 AM  IST","The Supreme Court’s much-anticipated ruling on the disputed site in Ayodhya has been hailed as balanced and nuanced. There is some merit to this description. The Court overruled the Allahabad high court’s partition of the property among the three major litigants as legally untenable. Instead, the Court handed the disputed property – where the Babri Masjid stood before its destruction – to a Rama Temple Trust for the construction of a temple. The Muslim litigants were compensated by a five-acre piece of land elsewhere in Ayodhya for construction of a mosque.
A closer reading of the 1,000-plus page judgment though brings out some of the failings of the ruling, those that have plagued the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on religion. One of the characteristics of Supreme Court rulings, going back to landmark judgments such as the Yagnapurushdasji or Satsangi judgment in the 1960s, is the assumption that Hinduism or Hindus are undifferentiated and homogeneous. In the very first paragraph of its ruling, the court says that the “Hindu community” claims the disputed site as the “birth-place of Lord Rama”. Arguably, all Hindus do not believe that the disputed site itself was Lord Rama’s birthplace. But more importantly, the court in its judgment elided the intensely political context of the Ayodhya dispute and the claims around it, although the judges wanted to convey a message of conciliation.

Unsurprisingly, much of the voluminous judgment revolves around evaluating the faith and belief of Hindus in and reverence for a disputed site, which is a tricky proposition at the best of times. Indeed, one of the judges also felt it necessary, in an addendum to the judgment, to provide further evidence of the belief of Hindus in the disputed site as the birthplace of Rama. The court reached its conclusions on the claims of Hindus based on what it felt was a greater weight of evidence. It was not willing to go only by the Hindu “faith and belief” in the birthplace of Lord Rama.
The court said, “Title cannot be established on the basis of faith and belief … Faith and belief are indicators towards patterns of worship at the site on the basis of which claims of possession are asserted.” In deciding claims of possession the court evaluated a variety of evidence, including religious texts, travelogues, oral evidence and particularly the controversial and disputed findings of the Archaeological Survey of India. While the court did find that an older structure existed below the mosque, it did not accept evidence of the earlier structure having been destroyed to build a mosque.
However, the court did find evidence for desecration of the existing mosque on the disputed site in 1949, when Hindu idols were placed inside the structure, and the eventual destruction of the masjid in 1992. To remedy the wrongs, the court exercised its authority under Article 142 to award another plot of land to the Muslims to build a mosque. The Court justified this in the name of secularism, rule of law, equality of all faiths and tolerance. The irony is that, arguably, the court verdict upholds them in a problematic manner.
One could, of course, contend that there is a separate criminal case where the perpetrators of the demolition of the mosque in 1992 are being tried. But the excruciatingly slow pace of the trial does not give much hope that the main protagonists in the 1992 events, which constituted one of the worst blots on Indian secularism, will ever be punished.
By and large, most political parties and groups have publicly accepted the court’s verdict. However, it would be foolhardy to believe that the construction of a new temple in Ayodhya, and possible triumphalism associated with it, will be absent from political discourse and future election campaigns. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken about there being no winners or losers in the court judgment and that there is no place for “fear or bitterness” in today’s India. One wonders though what the political reaction would have been if the court judgment were flipped and the disputed property given to the Muslim litigants and a different plot of land to the Hindus.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",the supreme courts muchanticipated ruling on the disputed site in ayodhya has been hailed as balanced and nuanced there is some merit to this description the court overruled the allahabad high courts partition of the property among the three major litigants as legally untenable instead the court handed the disputed property – where the babri masjid stood before its destruction – to a rama temple trust for the construction of a temple the muslim litigants were compensated by a fiveacre piece of land elsewhere in ayodhya for construction of a mosquea closer reading of the 1000plus page judgment though brings out some of the failings of the ruling those that have plagued the supreme courts jurisprudence on religion one of the characteristics of supreme court rulings going back to landmark judgments such as the yagnapurushdasji or satsangi judgment in the 1960s is the assumption that hinduism or hindus are undifferentiated and homogeneous in the very first paragraph of its ruling the court says that the hindu community claims the disputed site as the birthplace of lord rama arguably all hindus do not believe that the disputed site itself was lord ramas birthplace but more importantly the court in its judgment elided the intensely political context of the ayodhya dispute and the claims around it although the judges wanted to convey a message of conciliationunsurprisingly much of the voluminous judgment revolves around evaluating the faith and belief of hindus in and reverence for a disputed site which is a tricky proposition at the best of times indeed one of the judges also felt it necessary in an addendum to the judgment to provide further evidence of the belief of hindus in the disputed site as the birthplace of rama the court reached its conclusions on the claims of hindus based on what it felt was a greater weight of evidence it was not willing to go only by the hindu faith and belief in the birthplace of lord ramathe court said title cannot be established on the basis of faith and belief … faith and belief are indicators towards patterns of worship at the site on the basis of which claims of possession are asserted in deciding claims of possession the court evaluated a variety of evidence including religious texts travelogues oral evidence and particularly the controversial and disputed findings of the archaeological survey of india while the court did find that an older structure existed below the mosque it did not accept evidence of the earlier structure having been destroyed to build a mosquehowever the court did find evidence for desecration of the existing mosque on the disputed site in 1949 when hindu idols were placed inside the structure and the eventual destruction of the masjid in 1992 to remedy the wrongs the court exercised its authority under article 142 to award another plot of land to the muslims to build a mosque the court justified this in the name of secularism rule of law equality of all faiths and tolerance the irony is that arguably the court verdict upholds them in a problematic mannerone could of course contend that there is a separate criminal case where the perpetrators of the demolition of the mosque in 1992 are being tried but the excruciatingly slow pace of the trial does not give much hope that the main protagonists in the 1992 events which constituted one of the worst blots on indian secularism will ever be punishedby and large most political parties and groups have publicly accepted the courts verdict however it would be foolhardy to believe that the construction of a new temple in ayodhya and possible triumphalism associated with it will be absent from political discourse and future election campaigns prime minister narendra modi has spoken about there being no winners or losers in the court judgment and that there is no place for fear or bitterness in todays india one wonders though what the political reaction would have been if the court judgment were flipped and the disputed property given to the muslim litigants and a different plot of land to the hindus

Passing an Ordinance on a subject that is under consideration by the Supreme Court would weaken the institutional integrity of the Republic, create further religious division in society and lay the government open to the charge that its commitment to a Ram temple at Ayodhya is an election gimmick that lies dormant for the most part of its five-year term and wakes up, just ahead of elections, all sound and fury.

The sensible thing to do is to wait for the Supreme Court to start hearing the multiple challenges before it to the 2010 Allahabad High Court order dividing the disputed land into three parts, one to the Sunni Wakf Board and two to Hindu groups, and to wait for its verdict.
The dispute dates back at least to the 1850s, when communal clashes occurred over the Babri mosque, which was built in the 16th century, at the site, it is claimed, of a demolished temple. A legal dispute emerged after Hindu activists broke into the mosque and placed idols inside, in December 1949, after which the place stopped functioning as a mosque and ritual worship of the idols was permitted, although the site was off limits for the public.
The cases simmered on, and the mosque was demolished in December 1992, after a seven-year-long campaign led by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and BJP to demolish the mosque and build a temple at its site.
When such an old and contentious case has wound its way through the judicial maze and is approaching final resolution within a matter of months, the normal response would be to say that if we could wait for 70 years for a legal decision as to who owns the plot of land on which the mosque once stood and the temple is proposed to be built, we could wait for a few more months.
An Ordinance to short circuit that legal process would indicate an electoral agenda, rather than one driven by faith. Nothing precludes, however, a compromise among the parties to the dispute, outside the courts.

It was the 2014 general election. A humble ‘chaiwala’ dared to defy the most powerful dynasty and won by a landslide. It was unimaginable by any standards. The party in power with roots deeply entrenched in the system and with the entire establishment & eco-system firmly in their hands, was untouchable. But the people of the nation had made up their minds. The massive corruption and poor performance of the UPA government was rejected outright. The development agenda of the NDA alliance led by BJP was welcomed with open arms. When the verdict came, the NDA had a comfortable majority with 282 seats, acquired in the name of the most reputed ‘Brand Modi’. For the first time ever, in the history of independent India, a party other than Congress had won a simple majority on its own.
After that historic victory, Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept his word with the people of the country who had full faith in his promise of good governance. It was an impeccable corruption-free five year term. Infrastructure development that was not done in 70 years was now being accomplished at break neck speed. Demonitization broke the backbone of black money and corruption. The long overdue implementation of GST was systematically done. 100% village electrification was no small achievement. 10 crore toilets were built under the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’. Long pending demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans – the ‘One Rank One Pension’ was implemented. National security became the top priority. India gained more respect in the world than ever before. PM Modi’s dream of overall economic development of the underprivileged population turned into reality with ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan dhan Yojana’. The ambitious ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ successfully provided clean cooking fuel to 50 million women of BPL families. Perhaps, it would not be wrong to say that in five years, PM Modi achieved what the Congress didn’t achieve in sixty!
Having acquired so many feathers in their cap, once again, the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi went back to the people in 2019, this time armed with an A+ report card. ‘Phir ek baar, Modi sarkaar’ dominated the political scenario & PM Modi had won the heart and confidence of the entire nation with his model of good governance. The people of the country were convinced about his ‘neeti’ and ‘neeyat’ and showed their support by giving the Bharatiya Janata Party an even bigger victory this time in the 2019 general election for a second term in office with a one-sided mandate of 303 seats. ‘Janta Janardhan’ was damn sure about what they wanted.
As soon as he took the oath of office for a second time, the unstoppable Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up even bigger challenges and began working on important issues that had been kept simmering on the back burner for decades by every other government – The legislation on Triple Talaq, Dilution of Article 370 by scrapping of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and setting up a trust to build the Ram temple at Ayodhya as per the Supreme Court judgement – each one of these were extremely complicated issues that should have been simplified & sorted at the earliest. But the governments in power had been using them all along as tools in hand to fear monger and polarize their own vote banks, nation be damned. Over time, the issues only kept getting complicated further.
Taking these four gigantic reforms to their logical end within the first year of coming power is an achievement that neither the critics of the Bharatiya Janta Party nor their staunchest supporters could ever have imagined.
Triple Talaq
On 30th July 2019, the Parliament of India declared the practice of Triple Talaq as illegal, unconstitutional and made it a punishable act. Muslim women who had been denied legal parity with Hindu and Christian women for decades considered the passage of this bill as their personal victory. India will never forget the 1986 Shah Bano case where the Rajiv Gandhi led Congress government and Muslim clerics worked together to overturn a Supreme Court judgment. The same people who so brutally throttled Shah Bano’s self respect and the Indian Judiciary back then, once again tried their best to fear monger, portray the Triple Talaq bill as an anti-Muslim move and block it. But the Narendra Modi government did not allow vote bank politics to overpower long denied gender justice and finally the archaic and medieval practice of Triple Talaq has now been trashed.
Abrogation of Article 370 & 35A
In yet another phenomenal move, Article 370 – a long standing barrier between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and rest of India, was broken on 5th August 2019. It was beyond anyone’s imagination that the abrogation of Article 370 would happen within 100 days of the Modi government coming to power. This ‘temporary’ bill was not allowing Kashmiris to be part of the mainstream and had alienated them from India and the entire world. Kashmiris barely had any access to even the basic rights like healthcare and education. Cut off from the world, all they were exposed to was terror.
Along with Article 370, the revocation of Article 35A has been another big leap towards bringing Kashmir into the mainstream. Not only did Article 35A empower the state of Jammu and Kashmir to define ‘permanent residents’ in the state and accord special rights and privileges to them, it was also openly anti women and anti Dalit. Such a flawed bill did not deserve recognition in a secular democracy. The only people who opposed the abolition of this bill were those who had been milking the situation for years and had greatly benefitted from it politically. Abrogation of Article 370 will be recognized by our future generations as one of the most significant constitutional amendments in the history of independent India.
Ram Mandir at Ayodhya
If one has to mention the longest running, most controversial dispute in the history of India’s cultural, legal and political battles, it has got to be Ayodhya’s Shree Ram janmabhoomi – Babri Masjid land dispute. The first case in the Ayodhya title dispute was filed 134 years ago, way back in 1885. Since then, several law suits, writ petitions & verdicts came and went but were unable to quiver the historical and spiritual significance attached to Lord Ram and Ayodhya. For the 80% Hindu majority in India, Ram Mandir was not just a title suit, it was their cultural ethos, a matter of their faith.
It was an issue that should have been handled very delicately by the people in power but unfortunately they were looking at it only from a political angle to divide communities. The riots between Hindus and Muslims, that followed the Babri masjid demolition, led to the death of at least 2000 people. In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India confirmed that Babri Masjid was built on land where a ‘non-Islamic’ structure previously existed. Several other evidences to back that claim were presented in the highest court of law. Finally, the Supreme Court on 9th November 2019 ordered the entire disputed land to be handed over to a trust to build the Ram Mandir. The Supreme Court ordered to form this trust and a Board of Trustees within three months. It also ordered the government to give 5 acres of land inside Ayodhya city limits to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque. Had the Modi government not shown their will to patiently and very amicably take this complex issue to its logical conclusion, India would have still been bereft of it’s cultural identity.
Citizenship Amendment Act
The Citizenship Amendment Bill is about granting Indian Citizenship to persons belonging to the minority community – namely the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis & Christians, who have migrated to India after facing religious persecution in the three Islamic nations – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
The Citizenship Amendment Bill was a part of BJP’s manifesto since 2014. Infact, this bill was first tabled in 2016 and referred to a joint parliamentary committee that tabled it’s report in January 2019. But it had lapsed with the end of the 16th Lok Sabha’s tenure. After the formation of 17th Lok Sabha the bill was re-introduced and passed first in the Lok Sabha and subsequently in the Rajya Sabha. After receiving assent from the President of India, the bill assumed the status of an act and finally came into force on 10 January 2020.
The Citizenship Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. Interestingly, no one had protested the amendments then. Infact the CAA was then supported by the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and even the Left parties. But suddenly now the same people started fear mongering and portraying the bill as Anti-Muslim inspite of this bill not affecting the citizenship or rights of even a single Indian Muslim. Massive protests erupted across the nation by either the ill-informed or those who had vested interests, but the Government was firm. It is a matter of great concern that minorities in our neighbouring theocratic countries have borne brutal atrocities and faced persecution since decades, leaving them with no other option but to seek asylum in India. All three countries in question were essentially Islamic nations so the questions of Muslims facing persecution did not even arise. Those opposing the bill need to understand the difference between illegal immigrants and those who were seeking shelter as a last option. They must also understand that the citizenship status of every single Indian Muslim remains unchanged. By giving citizenship to those in genuine need, the Modi government has upheld an idea that is one of the key tenets of secularism – ‘Sarva Dharam Sambhav’.
At a time when India is going through a health crisis that the whole world is struggling to overcome, being governed by a leader who is handling this pandemic in the most efficient manner is comforting. Not only India, infact several world leaders have praised the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Viewing the Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity to achieve economic self-reliance, the Prime Minister has announced the ambitious ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, an economic package which works out to a whopping 10% of the GDP, making it amongst the largest in the world! From being a third world nation, India is steadily moving towards achieving self-reliance & self-sustainability.
And while the BJP is achieving one milestone after another and celebrating an eventful first year in office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, just like Arjun in Mahabharat, has his eyes firmly fixed on just one goal – Rashtra Pratham. Nation First!

their hands was untouchable but the people of the nation had made up their minds the massive corruption and poor performance of the upa government was rejected outright the development agenda of the nda alliance led by bjp was welcomed with open arms when the verdict came the nda had a comfortable majority with 282 seats acquired in the name of the most reputed brand modi for the first time ever

In Maharashtra, the post result scenario with Shiv Sena suddenly propping up its desire to lunge for the Chief Minister’s post actually queered the pitch. In the beginning, the BJP played by the rule book daring the other side to go for a disparate and immoral alliance between Congress, NCP & Shiv Sena where all sides would have had to light the pyre of key elements of their agenda. It was with this principle that the BJP went ahead with imposing President’s rule in the State. Then what prompted the midnight coup and the desperate support of Ajit Pawar with a bye-bye to the anti-corruption plank and a hurried swearing-in. Did Devendra Fadnavis mislead the Central leadership about the support Ajit Pawar enjoyed or did the Central leadership think, it held all the aces because the Pawar family – Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Praful Patel, had investigations on against them. It the unravelling of this mystery that will hold the key to the political drama that will unfold over the next few weeks.
While the BJP may have emerged bruised in this bout, it is the Congress and the Shiv Sena, that have virtually given-up on all future planks of their ideologies and their identity. The Shiv Sena’s manifesto with the BJP talked about the Ram Mandir resolution. In fact, Uddhav Thackrey was supposed to go to Ayodhya during this period to celebrate the Supreme Court verdict, but he gave that up to be present in Mumbai for confabulations of setting up a new Sarkar and a new common minimum programme. And the new common minimum programme has forgotten the Mandir and has promised to uphold secular values. What happens to the Hindu Rashtra?
Just last year, while unveiling a book on the Life of Hindu Mahasabha leader and freedom fighter Veer Savarkar, Uddhav Thackrey launched a scathing attack on Mani Shankar Aiyar, saying “he should be beaten up with shoes”. Mani Shankar Aiyar’s fault – he had called Veer Savarkar as the father of Hindutava and propounded of the two-nation theory. Will Uddhav Thackrey now hug Aiyar as an alliance partner and live happily ever after?
In its manifesto with the BJP, the Shiv Sena had decided to organise Tirtha Yatras for Hindu Aastha and dedicated corridors for Hindu Pilgrims. But now in its common minimum programme, the Congress and the NCP have ensured the Shiv Sena will swear by minority welfare. The contradictions are many.
Coalitions are known to have contradictions, but the one question that will need to be asked is- can the leopard (in this case the tiger), change its spots (in this case stripes)? And that is a question that will continue to haunt this alliance, sharing the spoils of power is very often a huge binding force and sticking glue but can such coalitions survive the test of time. Already questions are being raised by Ajit Pawar to his own uncle on why he should not be a Chief Minister for 50% of the tenure of this Government because he already had the Deputy Chief Minister’s post as part of the Fadnavis Government. Even if Sharad Pawar has been crowned as a Chanakya this whole season, he will find it difficult to manage his strange nephew Ajit Pawar, who might be a tag more difficult to manage that a Governance novice like Uddhav Thackrey.
And what are the Congress’ gains by this alliance? They may have got a foot in the door in the power sweep States, but really have managed only to get the crowns. Can Sonia Gandhi ever forget the names Bala Sahab Thackrey and his son Uddhav Thackrey have called her in the past? Political observers know the Gandhi family neither forgives nor forgets easily. In his last speech, from Shivaji Park Bala Saheb Thackrey himself has compared, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, as foreigners and Italians ruling India after the Mughals and British. He had called for the throwing out of this family and these were not statements made in the heat of rallies, this at one time was the core ideology of the Shiv Sena. Can Sonia Gandhi forget these personal attacks or the fact that 38% of the Congress’s votes come from minorities, who might not be as forgiving of this betrayal as the Congress expects?
But for the BJP, lies the biggest challenge. In the first 2 weeks post results, did the BJP not moved because of the conspiracy theories of the distance between Fadnavis and the Central leadership and moved after pressure from Fadnavis at the end of the 4th week and differences within the party. Did this lead to a situation that went horribly wrong? And did Ajeet Pawar actually enter the alliance as a Trojan Horse, only to bargain closure of investigations against himself, his leader and his party members? Was BJP naïve to think that anything less than that would be the price to pay for this short-lived alliance? Its an introspection that the BJP will have to introspect on – Behind the Bravado – in the coming weeks. In the middle of this is the helpless voter of Maharashtra, who’s been royally corned by both sides and will only have to live day-to-day, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. Not something, any citizen of India deserves.

     Fresh election is the only answer.  It will show whether the unholy alliance is really capable of winning seats and forming a government or not.

63,1617655134-208,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"Corridor symbolises reverence, aspirations and apprehensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/generals-jottings/corridor-symbolises-reverence-aspirations-and-apprehensions/,"Corridor symbolises reverence, aspirations and apprehensions","November 10, 2019, 9:55 AM  IST","It is a bit of incongruity (mercifully glossed over) that the focus of 550th birth anniversary celebrations are two abodes of Guru Nanak, Kartarpur in Pakistan and Sultanpur Lodhi in India, rather than more appropriate Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib in Pakistan. While Pakistan exults at this milestone in its revanchist journey, will this quest spread to Nankana Sahib and Panja Sahib, and how will free access be granted to other shrines? These are worrisome and pertinent questions, which may haunt Pakistan.
Kartarpur is the place where Guru Nanak exhibited the most laudable examples of handing over his temporal seat (in his lifetime) on non-dynastic basis and then continued with spiritual work coupled with farming for 18 years. Defying and disregarding this legacy, current political satraps continue to cling to power and nurture their dynasties, blatantly. They have further entrenched this malady by matrimonial alliances, amongst influential ruling families particularly in Punjab thereby ensuring collective immunity. It is most unfortunate that slugfest for brownie points has resulted in separate events, superfluous expenditure, confusion and even tussle for getting PM to venues.
While few want to take credit for this historic initiative, yet it has been possible due to sustained collective yearning, prayers and untiring efforts of many. It is rather unfortunate that in trying to be the showstopper, Navjot Sidhu seems to have walked into a crafty orchestrated trap.
Notwithstanding our reverence, and at the risk of being labelled as spoilers, many like Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh have valid apprehensions. These views are prefaced with assertion that the Sikh community has displayed unimpeachable loyalty and is not known to be naive.
Current initiative on corridor project is being anchored by Khaki Generals and is possibly part of ISI’s diabolic Kashmir & Khalistan (K2) project. Doubts on this score are reinforced by Gen Asif Ghafoor vetoing concessions announced by Pakistan PM Imran Khan with regards to waiving off requirement of passport for Sikhs and facilitation fee for two days. The timing of this step has to be seen in the context of mischievous SFJ’s ‘Referendum 2020’ campaign and events like Canadian elections. Inclusion of visuals of the dreaded and controversial trio of Bhindranwale, Amrik and Shabheg in the official video is indicative of Pakistan wanting to utilise these as tools for psychological war. Similar evil intent is evident in prominent display of remains of an Indian shell in the vicinity of the shrine. More of the same must be in pipeline, aimed at encouraging centrifugal forces.
Competitive populism is driving self-appointed guardians of faith towards more extremist postures. It suits nouveau-rich and politically relevant (kingmaker) diaspora to fund mischief makers to chase Khalistani mirage. They seemed to be emulating Sheikhs, who have funded Jihadi influences and outsourced Wahabbi extremism to the subcontinent. Unfortunately, people who want to stoke these fires have forgotten that the last round of extremism had put Punjab irretrievably back by a couple of decades and degraded Punjabiyat. Are Punjabis prepared for another round of senseless terrorism?
Pakistan wants to leverage fault lines between communities by wanting to extend special concessions to Sikhs ignoring the inclusive culture of ‘Nanak Naam Lewa Sangat’, which includes all those who believe in Guru Nanak’s teachings. Besides Sikhs, Sehajdharis, Kabeerpanthis, Ravidasias, Sindhis and even Muslims were treated as one by Baba Nanak. Pakistan should reconsider levying of facilitation charges of $20, as gurdwaras world over provide not only free access but also free langar and many other facilities. Access and charges, if unavoidable, should be same for all pilgrims as envisioned in Guru’s inclusive message.
As communities rededicate themselves to Nanak’s path, it is time to introspect and reflect on some important questions. Has overemphasis on ‘rehat maryada’ (codified norms) articulated through rituals, impacted and diluted the very essence of the original ‘Sehaj’ path of Guru Nanak? It is also time to jettison the caste system, driving marginal sections to deras, which have sprouted all over Punjab.
Pakistan should also honour collective aspirations of populace on both sides for peace and reconciliation. This can happen, only if it gives up its quest to foment trouble in India, including activities like promoting Khalistanis, nefarious designs of crafting ‘Udta Punjab’ and Drugistan. Indians, particularly Punjabis and Sikhs, should remain vigilant to defeat these machinations.
Even Pakistan will have to remain on guard as such shrines with emotive connect remain potential target for mischievous elements for taking over as bargaining tool. It should rein in mischievous elements like Gopal Singh Chawla and sanitise the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee to keep extremist elements out. Pakistan must also ensure that minorities are given religious freedom and shielded from abduction and forced conversion, as evidenced in the recent case of Jagjit Kaur and numerous other cases.
The abiding wisdom enshrined in ‘Baba Nanak Shah Fakir, Hindu da Guru, Musalman da Peer’ needs to be carried forward in implementing historic Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya dispute. It is time, nation focuses on economic empowerment not allowing divisive religious issues to stymie our progress. The message is ‘Keerat Karo, Wand Chako’ — (endeavour and share) besides ‘Naam Japo’ (recitation).

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",it is a bit of incongruity mercifully glossed over that the focus of 550th birth anniversary celebrations are two abodes of guru nanak kartarpur in pakistan and sultanpur lodhi in india rather than more appropriate gurdwara janam asthan in nankana sahib in pakistan while pakistan exults at this milestone in its revanchist journey will this quest spread to nankana sahib and panja sahib and how will free access be granted to other shrines these are worrisome and pertinent questions which may haunt pakistankartarpur is the place where guru nanak exhibited the most laudable examples of handing over his temporal seat in his lifetime on nondynastic basis and then continued with spiritual work coupled with farming for 18 years defying and disregarding this legacy current political satraps continue to cling to power and nurture their dynasties blatantly they have further entrenched this malady by matrimonial alliances amongst influential ruling families particularly in punjab thereby ensuring collective immunity it is most unfortunate that slugfest for brownie points has resulted in separate events superfluous expenditure confusion and even tussle for getting pm to venueswhile few want to take credit for this historic initiative yet it has been possible due to sustained collective yearning prayers and untiring efforts of many it is rather unfortunate that in trying to be the showstopper navjot sidhu seems to have walked into a crafty orchestrated trapnotwithstanding

64,1617655123-205,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Supreme Court should stick to legal remit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-editorials/supreme-court-should-stick-to-legal-remit/,Supreme Court should stick to legal remit,"March 7, 2019, 11:17 PM  IST","Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde of the Supreme Court was entirely right when he observed that the Ayodhya dispute involves sentiments and faith and is not primarily a land dispute. These are grounds for the court to restrict itself to legal aspects of the dispute and leave finding a compromise to non-judicial processes, instead of seeking mediation and running the risk of being rebuffed. The provision in Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code on alternate dispute-resolution mechanisms, including mediation, contains two things that militate against the court’s proposed course of action. One, the court that directs the disputants to mediation must first identify what it deems a reasonable solution to the dispute. Two, if the mediation effort does not succeed, the parties will come back to the court for a statutory solution.
The elements of a solution the court identifies and proposes for mediation would not be a verdict but have the weight of the apex court’s authority behind it. If any one of the parties to the dispute — there are three, one Muslim body and two Hindu ones — finds it unfair, the result would be to feed a narrative that the nation’s judicial system is against whichever faith whose representative feels aggrieved. This could potentially harm the larger polity. Neither Hindu party is in favour of mediation as of now. In the event that mediation outcome is not acceptable to any party, it would have the right to get back to the court for what it considers a fair, judicial solution. Further, since the faith of large numbers is involved, myriad numbers who might feel betrayed by the mediation outcome could move the court against it.

Mediation, it is true, could take time and take the process of finding a Supreme Court-backed solution beyond the electoral calendar. That would be a pragmatic way for the court to get out of the way of partisan crossfire. But the principled way would be for the court to refuse to get involved in extra-legal bargaining. It is not the court’s job to solve problems created by politicians and their stratagems in pursuit of power.

     It is good that the Ram Mandir will not be an issue in this general election. As it is, there is a great deal of heat and dust building up. 2. At the risk of leaving one side deeply unhappy - we have seen how verdicts on sharing river waters are received on the ground - the apex court should do its duty without fear or favour, based on the documentary evidence placed before it. 3. Mediation / dialogue would have been a good way to settle this old dispute. However, that was before the tragic events of 6th December 1992. The Court would need to see authentic land  records going back more than 450 years in time to annul the claim of the institution that represents the Babri Masjid,...

              Mumbai Police fall from 26/11 martyrdom to the planting of an explosive-laden car outside Antilia",justice sharad arvind bobde of the supreme court was entirely right when he observed that the ayodhya dispute involves sentiments and faith and is not primarily a land dispute these are grounds for the court to restrict itself to legal aspects of the dispute and leave finding a compromise to nonjudicial processes instead of seeking mediation and running the risk of being rebuffed the provision in section 89 of the civil procedure code on alternate disputeresolution mechanisms including mediation contains two things that militate against the courts proposed course of action one the court that directs the disputants to mediation must first identify what it deems a reasonable solution to the dispute two if the mediation effort does not succeed the parties will come back to the court for a statutory solutionthe elements of a solution the court identifies and proposes for mediation would not be a verdict but have the weight of the apex courts authority behind it if any one of the parties to the dispute — there are three one muslim body and two hindu ones — finds it unfair the result would be to feed a narrative that the nations judicial system is against whichever faith whose representative feels aggrieved this could potentially harm the larger polity neither hindu party is in favour of mediation as of now in the event that mediation outcome is not acceptable to any party it would have the right to get back to the court for what it considers a fair judicial solution further since the faith of large numbers is involved myriad numbers who might feel betrayed by the mediation outcome could move the court against itmediation it is true could take time and take the process of finding a supreme courtbacked solution beyond the electoral calendar that would be a pragmatic way for the court to get out of the way of partisan crossfire but the

65,1617655218-227,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Dialect of Bhoomi pujan and Ram temple: Will there be a synthesis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-fact/dialect-of-bhoomi-pujan-and-ram-temple-will-there-be-a-synthesis/,Dialect of Bhoomi pujan and Ram temple: Will there be a synthesis,"August 13, 2020, 7:45 PM  IST","Post Bhoomi Pujan, huge display of concerns is observed across so-called liberal-democrat intellect dialogues about India’s secular character having been compromised blatantly by BJP dispensation and particularly by its Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So much so, questions are being raised on the equity of very construction of the temple even raising eyebrows over the hon’ble apex court’s verdict, consequent conduct of the establishment facilitating implementation of the verdict and at the climax of it, the Bhoomi Pujan by the Prime Minister. Arguments appear to take avoidable points over the conduct of the highest executive body undermining the very decency of the institution of the Prime Minister. The peculiar dilemma is that while politicians across parties have, by and large, accepted and welcomed the event as well as ensuing construction of the temple and refrained from criticisms and attacks of the govt, the task is hijacked by a particular class of thinkers and intellectuals.
This seriously objectionable and undesirable. There will be no end to arguments and logics if we go on peeling off layer after layer of history and sociology. Trying to search for precedence and historical arguments would lead us nowhere for many pages of the history would shout back and contradict the arguments taken for convenience. Unpleasant pages of past are always better to be forgotten and the present seen in correct and positive perspective and wishing progression in right direction. But then what would be the right direction, is to be thought over, again, without baggage on the head.
The undisputed fact of history has been that all ancient civilizations across the globe had been attacked, institutions demolished, literature burnt and people holding them massacred. Religions and knowledge have been the life line of civilizations from eternity and any aggressor wishing to grab the kingdom first tried kill the centers of religion and knowledge, thus, innumerable centers of worships and learning became victims of aggression. This happened to us as well – universities and libraries were destroyed across our country and of course, temples were looted and diminished time and again, account of which, many a times could not reflect even in history.
This is also an undisputed fact of history that Babar had been one of the most cruel and crude attackers of the prevalent Hindu religion, temples and even huge number of people simply with the sole purpose of crushing the culture and religion in order to create an atmosphere of terror borne acceptance. This fact is known and accepted. The problem, however, arises only when these aggressors are made synonyms with Indian inhabitants only in the name of community. Indian Muslims had nothing to do with these aggressors and often they too became victims. But unfortunately our historians and opinion makers made them believe and act the opposite – deserting their fellow countrymen and supporting the hatred left out by the aggressors. The idea and ethos of the country becomes secondary to community and things are twisted giving the sugar quoting of ideals like secularism, liberties and freedoms. 
Secularism is a borrowed concept – we did not have any such ethos in our Indian culture. As a western concept this is separation of religion from state – precisely the church separated from the state. There is history behind this western adoption of concept. We did not have had such historical background. Even for Bapu religion was inseparable from the state – there has always been a Raj Dharma to run the state in our scheme of things, there still is. Thus, from very beginning our idea of secularism had been different than that of the western concept of this. Unfortunately, the people at the helm of power did continuously have rather perverted idea of dealing with or not dealing with the religion which they called secularism – it had been, in general, encouraging all religions of minorities undermining, rather often at the cost of, the religion of the majority assuming them taken for granted. This created a whole generation of prejudiced people and everyone has his own idea of so-called secularism as the Indian establishment never defined it, let alone prudently exercise it.   
This explains why and how a Pakistan flag being hoisted at J&K had been taken so lightly by the establishment and the so-called liberal democrats and when the 370/35A was undone, the clear and precise criticism and attack was that the BJP establishment tried to dismantle the ‘only Muslim majority state’ of the country. This was the precise secularism practiced by the establishment – seeing the things with communal angle! This also explains why CAA was explained to be anti- Muslim and Indian Muslim citizens were made to fight for Pakistani migrants going against their own state. The way secularism has been practiced, it has created a fertile ground for breeding a complete antithesis of the idea. We do, today, have a clear class of intellectuals completely drenched with the perverted concept of secularism on the one hand and another class of accepting, preaching and practicing religion as part of the polity – we simply do not know when and how we would reach to synthesis stage of the idea in terms of Hegelianism.
BJP, on its part, is what it has always professed. It had always attacked and criticized the secularism being practiced, it did clearly fight for Ram Janmbhoomi and it did not indulge in any hypocrisy – it did what it vowed to do. It had its promises fulfilled for its constituency. It is also exercising apparent restraint being aggressive joining the dialogues going on around them.  But then let us remind ourselves that Late Rajiv Gandhi too talked of Ram Rajya, facilitated worships and Shilanyas at the site and started his campaign from Ayodhya only. So, that too was a chapter of practicing secularism only. So why not to find a conciliatory note and proceed ahead – taking forward the spirit of Jai Siya Ram of Narendra Modi.  
While attacking and criticizing too, there are rules of game and these have to be adhered to. The Ram Mandir is mandated to be built by the highest court of the land and all concerned had been vowing to go by the verdict. Now while there are no qualms from the litigants and locals – irrespective of communities – they are celebrating the times, many others are raising questions invoking past. Past, however, has everything to argue for and argue against too. The words and spirits of the judgment too has everything in it – the ugly facts of the past as well as the future hope for the social ethos at large. 
Reconstruction of destroyed institutions should be treated rebuilding of the lost cultural heritage. Remembering and reminding wrongs of the pasts open the somewhat filled wounds. Ram Janmbhoomi has been more a cultural heritage than a religious one as Ram has been termed as an ideal human and an ideal ruler. Idea of Ram and Ram Rajya have been an eternal dream of generations together – more often than not irrespective of faiths. It would be goodness of things that this is respected and accepted as this is and arguments should stop there. 
In fact a section of intelligentsia is seemingly taking over the role of political opposition. Instead of being opinion makers, they tend to become opinion imposers and injectors. In the process many a times they appear to maneuver, rather manipulate, the facts coloring them into their own choice. This has to be avoided and stopped.  Still there remains many of them giving thought to rainbow of ideas providing space for people at large form their own opinion and also provide a platform to express them. From them only will come out the facts of the society and emerge the synthesis!

66,1617655012-177,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,A citizen’s appeal for peace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/return-of-the-native/a-citizen-s-appeal-for-peace/,A citizen’s appeal for peace,"September 21, 2010, 6:45 PM  IST","I am, by nature, a non violent person. Barring the occasional fights with my sibling, which most of us have indulged in as children, I’ve not had a chance, nor felt the inclination to use strong arm tactics. Ahead of Friday 24 though — the day when the much talked about (not so awaited, after all) verdict in the Ayodhya Title suit is to be announced — I feel almost under pressure to go against my natural instincts and indulge, perhaps, my wilder side.

Think about it. From the country’s prime minister to the who’s who of all concerned parties, everyone is busy making appeals for peace. The way I see it, neither I, nor my family, not even my neighbours, their friends, or friends of their friends were likely to do anything against the law. Not on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday. We didn’t have any plans to break the law even on the following Monday. And I’m certainly my memory serves me right when I say this; we weren’t the ones to have caused a ruckus in December 1992 either. Back then, the same way that it will be now, it will only be members of political parties and misguided individuals, who may break the law. 

But just so their massive efforts of garnering the support of state police and paramilitary forces don’t go waste, the ‘public’ appeal could perhaps be reworded. Maybe, an internal email or handouts within party circles, could be sent out. It would serve us better, in fact, if those within the corridors of power, as well as those without power, could maintain peace.
  
Frankly, none of this would have even been an issue if only the administration, local and central, were to go about their jobs the way they always do – with scant regard for us ‘normal’ people. The  problem begins, when authorities, in this apparent bid for ‘peace’ and in a forced attempt to save us,  try to throw our lives off kilter.

For instance, on September 24, normal life is to remain paralyzed courtesy an almost bandh-like situation called by the state administration. In Lucknow, schools and colleges are to remain shut and public conveyance, especially auto rickshaws, are to remain off road, for the most part. In effect, the fear of God – you can choose between Allah and Ram Lala – has been put in the minds of all those who may be courageous enough to venture out.

Now at the expense of being disrespectful to the communities involved, I must confess I don’t care much for whichever way the verdict may swing. Nor, from what I gather, do residents of Faizabad and Ayodhya. Which building stood at Ground Zero in 1992 or 100 years before that didn’t matter then. Eighteen years on, it matters even less.

Back then, the incident meant little more than an indefinite holiday from school. Now, one feels it will be a waste of mammoth proportions if we allow a repeat of what happened then. At least in 1992, we were able to pin the blame on a segment of misguided people. This time, the administration is filling in for what the political parties did. I have immense respect for the keepers of law and order. I will also do everything within my means to help their cause. But I would have been more comfortable if I were allowed to treat September 24 as just another day and the Ayodhya Title suit verdict as just another judgment that courts across the country pronounce every day.   

Perhaps, it is time to turn the tables on the administration and send out our own appeal for peace. We want the peace. Really. If only they would let us have it!

     Invertebrates like yourself who don't have the courage to stand for your identity and others who portray their cowardliness as secularism is the main reason Hindus are fighting for identity. This is not the time to appeal for peace. It's the time to take back the country from invaders. Of course with your thick skin you will not understand this....

The government’s chief economist says India will soon overtake China as the world’s fastest growing economy. So it would, concurs a Morgan Stanley study, based on the expected demographic dividend as the share of the non-working, dependent population shrinks, boosting not only the share of active workers but also the savings required to finance massive investment. Foreign direct investment inflows of the magnitude that the world envied China for, for much of the last couple of decades, is now flowing into India. Indians themselves are aggressive outward investors, and investment promotion outfits of most advanced countries woo Indian capital. 
   The president of the United States warns his country’s children that if they don’t study hard, Indian children will eat their jobs. Indian enterprise is respected, even feared, as being capable of devouring good, middle-American jobs, if business process outsourcing is not curbed. 
   Indian managers are making their mark around the world. Indra Nooyi, Vikram Pandit and Anshu Jain have steered their ships with great elan over the choppy waters of the financial and economic crisis, to the far shore of greater profitability. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s views are received with respect and attention, when leaders of the world meet, to discuss globally coordinated solutions to global problems. 
   Yes, on most counts, India would indeed seem to be getting ready to play. So it would seem appropriate that India should host a major sporting event like the Commonwealth Games. However, the manner in which we went about organising them, producing a sordid tale of incompetence, corruption and shoddiness that has been unfolding in daily installments to public shock and horror, has made us hang our heads in shame. 
   But this is not all. The nation was on edge on September 30th, when a high court delivered its verdict on a disputed shrine at Ayodhya. The police forces were on full alert in all parts of the country. Several states had issued prohibitory orders, closed schools and colleges, in anticipation of violence that is no less menacing for its eventual non-occurrence. Should a nation about to take wing be cringing at its own reflection morphed through a prism of anger? The insurgencies in Kashmir and the north-east and by the Maoists, the concept of honour that impels father and brother to kill daughter and sister, the skewed distribution o social power that makes Dalits easy prey to the greed and lust of upper caste miscreant, the custom and mores that make even the Capital’s Metro provide exclusive compartments for women and, every so often, send a doctor off to jail for conducting pre-natal sex determination tests, what do all these tell us about the state of the Union? If this is preparation for play, what macabre sport are we preparing for? 
Yes, there is ugliness in our midst that the opening ceremony spectacle or Shera, the Games mascot’s smile or the colourful screens planted strategically all along the route the foreign athletes would travel cannot conceal. But India is not just chaos and dirt and violence. If there is one thing that suffuses India’s collective consciousness today as never before, it is hope — hope that things would improve, drastically, and for everyone. Without hope for the future, there can be neither joy in the present, nor creative action. But there is, indeed, hope, and joy, and plenty of action. India is indeed prepared to play. Let the games play on!

68,1617655083-194,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Hoping for divine justice: When gods become litigants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/onmyplate/hoping-for-divine-justice-when-gods-become-litigants/,Hoping for divine justice: When gods become litigants,"August 11, 2018, 4:24 PM  IST","The Supreme Court of India is no stranger to unusual arguments. When an institution has the final say on everything from property disputes to a basic right to privacy for Indians, you can be assured of a range of often quite unusual arguments.
But few judges of the Court will have heard quite such a range as the five on the Constitutional Bench that has been hearing three high profile cases: on the criminalisation of homosexuality, on women seeking entry to Sabarimalai temple and on the criminalisation of adultery.
The first and the last cases had arguments citing morality and society, but it was with the second that the arguments became both cosmic and constitutional. As when advocate J.Sai Deepak, arguing for one of the parties opposing temple entry, argued that the temple deity, Lord Ayyappa, was a legal person and as such was entitled to the same fundamental rights of the Constitution as any other Indian person.
Specifically, Deepak argued that the Lord was entitled to the rights allowed by Article 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty), Article 25 (Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) and Article 26 (Freedom to manage religious affairs). “He suggested that Lord Ayyappa’s right to maintain his ‘perpetual celibate’ status was covered under the right to privacy under Article 21,” reported one legal website.
The verdict will show if these arguments worked, but at the least they marked an interesting addition to an already quite extensive and unique thread in Indian legal thought: the case of Hindu deities being “juristic persons”, who defend or demand their rights in court. It may seem a peculiarly Indian paradox that presumably all-powerful gods can also appear quite human and in need of legal help.
This attitude may be ancient. Indian gods have often seemed to resemble those who revere them, with similar passions and practices in everything from love to food, so why not also in our notorious passion for litigation? This is after all the country where a court case started in 1836 over the property of Raja Rajkrishna Deb in Kolkata was still being fought in the 21st century.

Another example, pointed out by mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik, is of Odisha’s Sakshigopala Temple. The temple’s legend tells of Lord Gopala who agreed to appear to testify as a witness on behalf of a devotee. His only condition was that the devotee should lead the way to court without looking back – but he did, and the god became a statue. This was still enough to help him win, and he then built a temple in honour of the Lord who was willing to come to court. Sakshi is Sanskrit for witness.
These roots might lie in Indian tradition, but it was the British who gave them explicit legal form in the 19th century. In Stages of Capital, Ritu Birla’s fascinating account of how British laws and financial practices were adapted to India, she puts this development in the wider context of the evolution of the trust in Victorian Britain.
The idea of donating wealth on behalf of beneficiaries, but administered by third party trustees, had been developed by landed aristocrats in the 18th century but “it was in the next century that it came to be appropriated by the burgeoning middle class, especially the commercially astute and upwardly mobile business and professional sectors,” writes Birla.
The Industrial Revolution had given these sectors new wealth, and charitable donations, often with a religious angle, were one way to deploy the wealth to gain status. Trusts were the mechanism for this, so it was natural enough that the British sought to replicate the same pattern in India, especially as native entrepreneurs started making money and also sought to increase their status.
But Birla notes that there were long-standing Indian practices of giving donations, which existed within a web of community and religious associations, and these didn’t always sit easily with British models. With temples in particular, the links were complex, involving nuances of caste and community and also the practice of many merchants of treating temples as unofficial treasuries, where money could be kept, but also withdrawn when needed, even if it angered the priests who depended on that money.
When these complexities met British laws it usually ended up in Court. And as British judges dealt with increasing disputes over temple property, they hit on the idea of treating the deity as a legal person in whom ownership could rest. At one stroke this avoided having to sift through all the claims of tradition, while also neatly appearing to respect Indian sentiments by treating the idols as living persons.
In 1869 the Privy Council, the judges who made up the highest court of appeal in the British Empire decided the case of Maharani Shibessouree v. Mothooranath Acharjo by declaring that the shebait, the manager of the deity, could only act as a trustee on behalf of the deity. In 1875, in another case, the Privy Council articulated that the shebait had to act “as the manager of an infant heir.”
And in 1887, in what is called the Dakor Temple case, the Bombay High Court finally stated explicitly that the “Hindu idol is a juridical subject and the pious idea that it embodies is given the status of a legal person.” As Birla notes, the time was ripe, since this was just a year after the Indian Income Tax Act was passed which allowed exemptions for religious or public charitable purposes.
By 1925 this principle was established enough for the Privy Council in London to sum it all up by ruling, in the case of Pramatha Nath Mullick vs. Pradyumna Kumar Mullick that “the Hindu idol is, according to long established authority, founded upon the religious customs of the Hindus, and the recognition thereof by the Courts of Law, a ‘juristic entity’.” And it repeated the comparison with the trustee for an infant heir; the idols were, in law, infants who would never grow up.
Perhaps in response to this, the following years were to see an explosion of cases where deities went to court. In 1934 the Times of India (ToI) reported on how the deity at the Badrinath temple had won a claim of Rs54,000 (a huge sum at that time) against the trust of Rani Gomti Bibi of Allahabad, which had not delivered on promised donations.
In 1934 ToI reported on how Shri Thakoreji (Krishna), installed as an idol in several temples of the Vallabhacharya Vaishnav sect in Bombay had won an injunction against the sale of property donated by family whose patriarch had died, leaving an heir who was alleged to be “wasting and mismanaging the properties”. The heir argued that the properties were his, but the court sided with the Lord.
Deities didn’t always win. In 1937 a lady named Anandibai Vamanrao Barve in Dahanu near Bombay filed a case against Lord Maruti, alleging his devotees were performing religious ceremonies on land she had inherited, and were objecting to her building a wall on it; two years later ToI reported that she had won her case, and the Lord and his devotees had to withdraw.
Deities could also fight against each other. In 1938 ToI reported on a suit where “rival claims have been made on behalf of the deities Shri Ranchodji and Shri Gopalji, to the ownership of a house in which the latter is worshipped.” Shri Ranchodji alleged that he had allowed Shri Gopalji to install his idol in his own house after Shri Gopalji’s temple was washed away in a flood, and now he was trying to usurp it.
The post-Independence period saw further developments in the concept, not always to the benefit of deities. In 1969, for example, the Supreme Court upheld a decision first made by an income tax tribunal in Calcutta, which had decided that if deities were individuals then they could pay income tax. And in 1999 the Supreme Court again upheld the principle that deities could own property, even going to the extent of specifying how the deity could be consecrated.
Most famous of all, was the case of the Pathur Nataraja statue, which had been stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu, and sold abroad to the Bumper Development Corporation. The company had sent it to the British Museum for restoration, from where it was seized by Scotland Yard in 1991. When a case was filed by the Indian government for restitution of the idol, Lord Shiva was cited as one of the plaintiffs.
According to a report in ToI the company took issue with this: “Bumper’s plea was that the courts of Britain ought not to allow a Hindu god to sue here. They claimed that the sovereign (the Queen) was the highest power in the UK, and that this was, anyway, a Christian kingdom.” Rather magnificently, the court replied that Hinduism was practiced in the UK too, and so Lord Shiva could remain as a plaintiff.
Yet this period has also seen deities as persons appearing in more controversial contexts, most notably in the Ayodhya Ram Mandir case. And well before such painful controversies developed, doubts had been expressed about this concept. As far back as 1931 S.C.Bagchi, the principal of University Law College, Calcutta had delivered a series of lectures, later collected into a book titled Juristic Personality of Hindu Deities, where he detailed his scepticism with the idea.
Bagchi first establishes what is meant by a ‘juristic person’ and then cites a number of Sanskrit texts to help understand the idea of the deity in Hindu scripture: “There is so much anthropomorphism, mixed up with mysticism, in the Vedic conception of the deities that an entity of the type contemplated in the Vedas is not of any use in the jural world.”
Bagchi considers the convenience of the argument of vesting the property with the idol, but then suggests a more progressive option: “One may naturally ask whether the community itself, for whose spiritual benefit the institution was founded and endowed, may not more appropriately be regarded as a corporate body, forming the juristic person in whom the properties of the institution are vested.”
Bagchi’s argument seems to expose to 19th century creation of idols as juristic personalities as a legal fudge, devised by British jurists as a way of getting out of the tedious process of sorting out the claims of various Indian parties, with their complexities of caste and community practices. It is convenient and flattering to devotees, but it remains a fudge, with problems that will only show up with time.
What is happening now might seem to support his case. A legal concept that was devised in a fairly narrow context of property rights and trusts, is now extending into areas like privacy and fundamental rights, which simply expose further problems.
If deities pay tax, can they claim the right to vote, and if so, then could they run for political office? How can they claim to be celibate when, as perpetual legal minors, the issue of sex should not arise at all? And at what point does this entanglement of Hindu gods with such material issues start seeming like an offence to their spiritual role? Deities as juristic people might seem like a quaint part of Indian jurisprudence, but its consequences may not be quite as pleasant.

convenience of the argument of vesting the property with the idol but then suggests a more progressive option one may naturally ask whether the community itself for whose spiritual benefit the institution was founded and endowed may not more appropriately be regarded as a corporate body forming the juristic person in whom the properties of the institution are vestedbagchis argument seems to expose to 19th century creation of idols as juristic personalities as a legal fudge devised by british jurists as a way of getting out of the tedious process of sorting out the claims of various indian parties with their complexities of caste and community practices it is convenient and flattering to devotees but it remains a fudge with problems that will only show up with timewhat is happening now might seem to support his case a legal concept that was devised in a fairly narrow context of property rights and trusts is now extending into areas like privacy and fundamental rights which simply expose further problemsif deities pay tax can they claim the right to vote and if so then could they run for political office how can they claim to be celibate when as perpetual legal minors the issue of sex should not arise at all and at what point does this entanglement of hindu gods with such material issues start seeming like an offence to their spiritual role deities as juristic people might seem like a quaint part of indian jurisprudence but its consequences may not be quite as pleasant

69,1617655250-233,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The art of forgetting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/extraordinaryissue/the-art-of-forgetting/,The art of forgetting,"October 5, 2010, 11:38 AM  IST","The last week proved, yet again, how short our memory is. Everything heals, everything changes with time. Even the biggest traumas are wiped out by new events and, sometimes, even new traumas. So much so that what obsessed us just a couple of years or months or even weeks back is so suddenly erased from our consciousness that it looks like the entire nation has struck the delete button at the same time. Sometimes it’s sad. But often it’s great. It shows us that India has really taken yoga to heart and can leave behind its anger, outrage, rancour and move on. I guess that’s why we are such a great nation.
 
Let’s look at the CWG. The hatred against the British that fuelled our freedom struggle has long vanished. Today we celebrate the Games as friends. If we do well and win many medals, we will see that as a befitting reply to history. We have forgotten the Black Hole tragedy, the Jalianwala Bagh massacre. Frankly, I can’t even remember the rest. I would much rather remember the trains, the post offices, the schools and colleges, the gothic churches, the art deco architecture that the British left behind, and their biggest contribution, the English language that has opened us up so quickly to the modern world, to science and technology, the global economy. We never struggled like the Chinese to integrate with others. English provided us the perfect tool, even though Mulayam Singh may not agree.
 
But that took sixty years. Now look at the Ayodhya verdict. Even before it was announced, everyone knew that whatever it would be, the new India had moved on, beyond Ayodhya. The elaborate security was only to ensure that no political party would misuse the verdict to stoke mischief. In less than two decades, both Hindus and Muslims have set aside the contentious issue that killed thousands of men, women and children in a maelstrom of violence they had nothing to do with. What began as a political tamasha, the rath yatra, masquerading as an issue of national pride soon snowballed into a terrible human tragedy. Despite all efforts of the BJP to keep it alive, the debate is now dead. Everyone, particularly the young, yearn for peace and pragati today.
 
But why talk of centuries and decades? I bet once the Games are over, all this hysteria over the most corrupt and shameful event in recent history, will be promptly forgotten. If Kalmadi braves out the next few days and survives, there’s no reason to believe he will ever get the boot. A rap on the knuckles, perhaps. The boos he got during the opening ceremony will be seen as adequate punishment for his huge heist. If Ramalinga Raju can get away so easily, why would we make such an effort to remember Kalmadi’s indiscretions? Even RR Patil’s back as Maharashtra’s Home Minister despite 26/11. Only Vilasrao remains to be restored as CM but he’s in no hurry. He has a comfortable berth in the Centre to while away his time.
 
That our collective memory’s getting shorter and shorter is best exemplified by the fact that the Pakistani contingent at the Games got the biggest ovation after the Indians. It must have amazed the whole world that while we speak so bitterly against Pakistan on every international platform for destabilising Kashmir and exporting terrorism to India we still love their sportspeople so much, their actors, their singers, even their Page 3 people, two of whom got a rousing welcome last weekend when they entered Bigg Boss. One, a cross dresser who runs a chat show on Pakistani TV. The other, a kiss and tell artiste who has embarrassed her former lover, cricketer Mohammad Asif by alleging she knew all about his dirty match fixing ways even as she cuddled with him under the blanket. Pakistani pop star Ali Zafar not only had a hit in Tere bin Laden but has also been signed on by Yashraj to make more films in a city where the Sena and MNS rule the roads. Adnan Sami happily lives here, in a flat with two squabbling wives.
 
But the most telling example is the box office. Kismet ruled it for 30 years. Then came Sholay in 1975. DDLJ could challenge it only after 20 years. In 5 years Gadar took it on. Singh is Kingg was just about to stake its claim when Ghajini came 2 months later, knocked it off its perch. Then came Three Idiots a year later to break all records. Only to have Dabangg challenge it 8 months later. And now, in 3 weeks, Rajnikanth has walked off with it all. Proves how ephemeral all success is too.
 
Are you now surprised why Mein Kampf outsells My Experiments with Truth in the land of the Mahatma or why a nation that once hated Azharuddin should vote him back as a MP? What about the four wrestlers and the two athletes who failed the CWG dope test last month? Aren’t they all back in our contingent?

70,1617655195-221,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The Ram temple ‘bhoomi pujan’ controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/blunt-frank/the-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-controversy/,The Ram temple ‘bhoomi pujan’ controversy,"July 28, 2020, 4:22 PM  IST","Once again as a nation we seem to be living up to our reputation of creating a controversy on an issue that in reality should be an occasion of pride for the whole nation. After nearly five centuries aspirations of all Indians, who believe in India, are about to be realized in the form of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Lord Ram is not only a religious deity for Hindus but also part of Indian heritage and therefore it is appropriate to say ‘All Indians’ instead of just limiting it to Hindus.
There was a lot of skepticism before the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute in November 2019. To the credit of Muslim litigants and the community as a whole, they accepted the verdict with grace and humility, a few disgruntled voices notwithstanding. This was particularly true for Hindu and Muslim communities in Ayodhya where everyone seemed to be relieved that a verdict had been reached.  They have lived there in harmony for ages and continue to do so today also when the construction of Ram Mandir is expected to start on 05 August with a simple ceremony. Both communities in Ayodhya have pledged to work towards building the temple and it is indeed a very welcome step as it also means development and prosperity for all. 
But then there are some on our country who cannot digest this simple truth. For them it is a taboo to see Hindus and Muslims standing shoulder to shoulder. Therefore, they have to create a controversy and ensure that Hindu Muslim divide raises its ugly head and vitiates the environment. The sad part is that most of these people are neither local residents of Ayodhya nor directly concerned in any manner with temple construction. Some political leaders from the opposition, a few pseudo seculars and some Muslim community leaders have jumped in the fray to question the building of the temple for various reasons. Needless to say, none of the reasons expounded by them stand to any scrutiny or have any merit. 
Some are now casting aspersions on the retired Chief Justice of India (CJI) under whose tenure the verdict was delivered while conveniently forgetting that it was a five-judge bench that delivered the judgment where CJI was just another member. One of the most senior politicians in the country wonders if building of the temple will help the nation in its fight against coronavirus? A question that frankly does not even warrant a response as it just shows a biased mindset and a deliberate lack of understanding of what Lord Ram means and stands for in this country. 
The biggest issue that seems to be bothering this anti-Mandir lobby is the decision by Door Darshan to telecast the ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ ceremony live. They think this move is against the secular credentials of the country, against the charter of the national broadcaster and has political connotations as BJP wishes to reach out for Hindu votes through this live broadcast. The same lobby had no problem when the visit of Pope or canonization of Mother Teresa or Haj pilgrimage bulletins were telecast live in the past apart from many other religious events for people of different faiths. For the lobby, those telecasts were within the realms of a secular India as they pertained to minority communities. But live telecast of Ram Mandir ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ event that has a much larger audience and significance is anti-secular. 
Without a doubt this is in line with the distorted version of secularism that has been practiced in the country for nearly seven decades where anything to do with Hindu or Hinduism is anti-secular. For any right-thinking Indian, irrespective of his religion, Ayodhya event has to be seen as a national event that is linked to nation’s heritage first and foremost. Any linkage to Hindu religion comes later. If any Indian cannot accept this axiomatic truth then his being a true Indian itself will be questionable. 
There has been a lot of debate on the participation of Prime Minister in the event in Ayodhya on 05 August. It is nothing but a ploy by Modi baiters to deride the Prime Minister. For many of them it is their only vocation since Mr Modi assumed the highest elected office in the country in 2014. Are Prime Ministers not allowed to have their beliefs as individuals? Nowhere dose the Indian constitution say that such leaders cannot practice their religion. Is it possible to believe that none of India’s past Presidents, Vice Presidents or Prime Ministers ever visited a religious place of worship? Ayodhya event is a once in a life time event for the nation. Attendance of the Prime Minister, who is holder of the highest elected office in the country, is warranted in his capacity as the NUMBER ONE representative of the people. 
Some have questioned the wisdom of holding ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ when the nation is going through the current Corona pandemic. Suffice it to say that all safeguards will be in place and all preventive measures taken as required. There are some who have put forth an argument that if this event can be allowed why not allow Id celebrations that are around the corner. This is again a very motivated argument aimed at creating mistrust and to stroke communal tensions. The festival of Id comes every year unlike the Ayodhya event which is a one-time event that the nation has been waiting for five centuries. Next, a festival like Id will mean thousands of congregations across the country unlike the Ayodhya event which is restricted to one place. It is obvious that while a single national event can be organized in a controlled manner with all precautionary measures in place, it will be impossible to exercise similar control over thousands of localized and uncontrolled Id events across the country. A similar logic would be applicable to Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Diwali events this year if the pandemic threat continues to loom over the nation. 
It has to be understood that ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ for Ram Temple is not a political event. But given the opposition’s opposition to the event, there is a danger of it being seen as one. If that happens the onus will be on the opposition and not the government of the day. If there is any indirect political fallout from the event in favour of Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) then there is very little the opposition can do about it. However, by opposing it and coming out with lop sided statements and baseless reasons on why it should not be held, the opposition is only ensuring political gains for BJP. Frankly a mature opposition should have seen the writing on the wall and supported the event. That would have resulted in a favorable political fallout for them many times more than what BJP may get today. But then current Indian political opposition and maturity were divorced five years ago and a remarriage is nowhere on the cards given the quality of their leaders.

71,1617655180-217,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"How COVID 19 exposes the communal cracks in India, Again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/poverty-of-ambition/how-covid-19-exposes-the-communal-cracks-in-india-again/,"How COVID 19 exposes the communal cracks in India, Again","April 2, 2020, 9:47 AM  IST","The abrupt cessation of all economic movement and social interaction due to the coronavirus pandemic is having the greatest impact on India’s more than 375 million migrant workers and other vulnerable populations. The nation’s Supreme Court has warned that the frantic migration of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from India’s largest cities is becoming a ‘bigger problem’ than the coronavirus outbreak itself. Yet, citing Hindu nationalism, many in the media are promulgating false narratives, blaming Muslims for the spread of COVID 19.
Prakash (name changed) is slogging by foot along the highway under the blistering sun with friends on a journey of 300 miles from Delhi to his home district in Uttar Pradesh (UP). He, along with thousands of other migrant workers, are part of one of the largest migrations India has ever seen due to the nationwide lockdown to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. Migrants like Prakash who depend on their housing and meals from their places of work have found themselves homeless, jobless, and hungry overnight. Their only recourse is to find their way back to their villages. Lacking money and means of transportation, thousands are making their journeys on foot. At least 22 people have perished during these grueling walks, and the numbers continue to rise.
Yet, at a time when social distancing is paramount to preventing the virus’s transmission, migrant workers have no alternative but to move together en-masse. Tired and terrified, it is not possible for individuals to practice social distancing during their exodus. Most fear dying of starvation and physical exhaustion more than contracting the coronavirus.
Despite an economic stimulus package of 1.7 trillion rupees ($22.5 billion) from the Government of India to help millions of low-income households cope with the 21-day lockdown, experts, including JP Morgan’s chief emerging markets economist, believe this cash infusion will not be enough to mitigate the financial hit millions of citizens are facing. Of grave concern, laborers in the informal sector, representing approximately 80 percent of India’s workforce, will not be eligible for the government’s cash and food handouts, as these are only designated for national labor registrants.
In contrast, countries such as Singapore have boosted its coronavirus relief package to 11 percent of the city-state’s GDP, while the U.S. passed a massive $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus epidemic and the UK rolled out a relief package equivalent to approximately 14 percent of its GDP.
The coronavirus pandemic is the most challenging crisis the world has faced since World War II, but the right-wing media in India has found whom to blame: Indian Muslims. Particularly a sect called Tablighi Jamaat.
Unfortunately, instigating fears of the ‘Muslim threat’ associated with the transmission of the coronavirus by selected media outlets aligns with previous patterns of scapegoating Indian Muslims by the right-wing media. We remember reports from the riots that happened in Delhi this year when Muslims were blamed for the violence, even though they were the ones that suffered the most. ‘Media trials’ featuring anti-Muslim sentiment and accusations of blame directed towards Muslim communities have proven to be a boon for media ratings. Acting as judge and jury, social media and news outlets broadcast predetermined verdicts accusing Indian Muslims of bringing the coronavirus to the continent. Reigniting anti-Muslim sentiment is an expedient way to divert the public’s attention away from the desperate misery of thousands of migrant workers coping with India’s lockdown. There is clear evidence that the corona virus was neither brought to India nor spread by Muslims. 40,000 people are in quarantine in Punjab because of a single index case who traveled from Italy to India. The Chief Minister of UP organized a religious ceremony in Ayodhya in violation of the government’s lockdown orders. Proof notwithstanding, right-wing warriors are likely to remain indifferent to these events because it does not suit their political interest.
Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement, was mistaken in not taking warnings about COVID-19 more seriously. However, they were not alone. Early on, many government ministries and civil society organizations did not view COVID-19 as a public health emergency. Accusing the Jamaat of spreading the corona virus is therefore only disingenuous, but also punitive In a more just world, there could have been a debate about how India should prepare for the COVID-19 challenge, or why previous administrations did not sufficiently invest in strengthening India’s healthcare systems. Today, this tale of negligence has resulted in India having only 40,000 functional ventilators for a population of 1.4 billion people, and one doctor for every 1, 435 citizens. However, this type of constructive reflection seems unimaginable at present.
With over 600 million mobile phone users nationwide, 400 million users of WhatsApp and 250 million Facebook users, sources of news have significantly altered the way Indians receive information and formulate their beliefs. In the era of pervasive fake news, it falls upon the shoulders of fact-driven reporters to pursue truths that represent the very democracy that defines modern India.

By a 2-1 majority judgment, the court ruled that it won’t be reviewing its 1994 observation that a mosque is not integral to Islam. However, it also said that that observation won’t be a guiding principle to decide the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute, the hearing for which will commence from October 29 in front of a three-judge bench.

ALSO READ: SC declines to refer to five-judge bench whether mosque is integral to Islam
While it can be argued that a larger bench should be hearing the landmark case, the approach of the apex court is in the direction of treating it purely as a land dispute. This means that the case should be settled according to existing property laws and legal arguments, not suppositions, sentiments or intentions. This is the right course since sentiments can’t take precedence over law in ensuring justice.
Ayodhya case verdict: Read full judgment
The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case is a big test for India’s constitutional promises. The case needs a decisive verdict based on principles of law. Thus, adjudicating the matter as a property dispute not only cuts out the clutter surrounding the case, but also immunises the pending final judgment from charges of bias. Today’s Supreme Court ruling has helpfully cleared the way for this.

     For how many more years are we going to dispute the Ram Temple issue . For how many more years the people of Ayodhya should suffer ? Come elections and the whole country beacomes tense . Well if the historical research says that there was a Sri Ram temple at the disputed spot , if the archiological finding says there was a temple , if the latest technology with the help of satellite shows the temple remains at the spot then why the dispute ? Lets all unite and contribute to build a magnificent temple and get rid of the issue . let's make it a beautiful tourist spot and generate finances for the people of Ayodhya . What's happening during all these years is the Politicians are enjoying the scene . The religious heads are minting money and We the fools are falling pray to the agressive talks of the Politicians and the religious heads of both the religions . This is another way of diverting people's minds from the failure of the Politicians from all the political parties . Let's think about the solution of how to make Rupee strong ,how to bring down the inflation , how to get back the fugitives back in the country ? Neither the BJP nor the Congress will ever get the fugitives back . We the people should fight for the survival of the country , We should not fight over petty issues among ourselves , We should dream of India as a solid Super Power . The Politicians have been destroying the country since independence , don't fall pray to their talks and hopeless promises , they will never give the people what they deserve instead they will always see the opportunity to destroy the peace in the country.  Jai Hind ....  Read More

73,1617655438-280,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The majesty of justice: The Ayodhya verdict lives up to both legal and moral scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-headline/the-majesty-of-justice-the-ayodhya-verdict-lives-up-to-both-legal-and-moral-scrutiny/,The majesty of justice: The Ayodhya verdict lives up to both legal and moral scrutiny,"November 11, 2019, 7:56 PM  IST","The verdict pronounced by the Supreme Court of India in the long running Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi title dispute was always going to be held up to both legal and moral scrutiny. But while the Supreme Court is not infallible, the rare unanimity of all five judges reduces worries of it being legally weak. In September 2010, when deciding the same matter, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court couldn’t bring itself to reach a consensus, because the judges weren’t convinced of each other’s arguments. Instead of administering a clean cut to the Ayodhya Gordian knot, the three-judge bench felt obliged to award a third of the disputed land to each of the contending parties, further entrenching already hardened positions. 
So, if the Supreme Court’s pronouncement is seen to pass the test of legality, can we say with some degree of certitude that it also convinces Muslims that India isn’t a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ where justice is only ever the prerogative of the majority? That, by handing the Muslim side five acres of land to build a mosque at an alternative site, the Supreme Court hasn’t been patronising? 
 Muslim parties, including firebrand AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, believe that the verdict is morally untenable. The first of the concerns is that the Supreme Court has entrusted the ‘vandals’ responsible for the demolition of the Babri Masjid the task of identifying an alternative plot of land to build a mosque. 
While the irony is not lost, the Supreme Court has ensured the land will be granted by invoking the powerful agency of Article 142 of the Constitution, which allows it to go above existing law to ensure complete justice.

Second, to allay criticism that the land grant was an act of ‘charity’ and was thrown in to dispel the notion that a majoritarian instinct dictated the judgment, it could be argued that the verdict went out of its way to dignify the hurt of Muslims. The Supreme Court after all makes it clear that the land grant is an ‘act of restitution’ for a wrong.  That wrong is clearly set out through an indictment of the Hindu side for ‘the act of desecrating the mosque’ by surreptitiously installing the idols of Lord Ram under the central dome of the Babri Masjid in 1949.  If the Bench was complicit in appeasing Hindu sentiment why would it go out of its way to expose the criminality that defined the acts of the ‘majority’ at the time? 
Paving the way for truth and reconciliation, the top court also has arguably gone beyond the ambit of the case by acknowledging that the ‘destruction of the mosque in 1992 was an egregious violation of the law’. As we know the Babri Masjid Demolition Case is still pending and it is possible this observation could influence that verdict. 
The other more immediate concern of the Muslim community is that the verdict is a call to another mobilisation, only this time over the “unfinished majoritarian agenda of reclaiming disputed structures in Kashi and Mathura”. This fear is derived from the notion that by recognising the juridical rights of Ram Lalla the top court has entitled other deities to claim absolute ownership over disputed holy sites. Once again, this fear ignores the salience of the apex court calling upon state governments to give primacy to the 1991 Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act if and when litigation is initiated over other disputed sites of worship. The 1991 Act prevents the conversion of religious places of worship from the shape and form they were in at the time of Independence. 
Some particularly sceptical commentators are worried that the verdict would only hasten India’s transition towards a ‘Hindu Pakistan’. While it is true that some members of the Hindu right have succumbed to the lure of triumphalism, they are mostly at the fringes. If anything, the Ayodhya verdict underscores the inherent robustness of India’s secularism. The judges made it a point to emphasise that the court could not ‘remedy historical wrongs’ and rejected the plea to correct the demolition of several temples by Mughal emperors.  
Not just this, the verdict itself emphasised ‘fact over faith’. In an addendum one of the judges anonymously went to great lengths to list the proof that convinced him to conclude that Ram Lalla was indeed born at the disputed site. The verdict thereby uncouples the Hindu claim over the disputed site from ‘belief’ and consciously places law above faith. The Constitution is the real winner here.       
Credit must also go to a billion Indians who placed their ‘faith’, excuse the pun, in the hands of five judges. This by itself is the greatest act of tolerance and inclusion. Several governments have also played their part, waiting patiently for years altogether for the courts to finally adjudicate the dispute. 
The five judges best summed up their own endeavour with the following words: “Justice would not prevail if the Court were to overlook the entitlement of the Muslims who have been deprived of the structure of the mosque through means which should not have been employed in a secular nation committed to the rule of law. The Constitution postulates the equality of all faiths. Tolerance and mutual coexistence nourish the secular commitment of our nation and its people.”   
The majesty of these words makes it hard to deny that India’s highest court has set a new precedent in constitutional morality for others to follow when deciding vexing inter-faith disputes.

The acquittal of all the accused has made those associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi and the wider Hindu nationalist ecosystem elated. At the same time, India’s secularists and Muslim leaders have viewed the judgment as a travesty of justice. Similar conflicting responses had also greeted last year’s Supreme Court verdict that paved the way for the construction of the temple.
At one level, the verdict of the CBI court was inevitable. A charge of conspiracy is hideously difficult to prove unless, of course, the measure is firmly political. Most of the 32 individuals who have been acquitted were visibly elated at the way the kar seva on December 6, 1992, ended —with the Mughal shrine reduced to rubble and a makeshift Ram temple in place. A few may even have added to the emotional headiness of the kar sevaks in the final hour before the third dome came crashing down. However, there is a profound difference between egging on a mob, celebrating an event, taking political advantage of it and carefully plotting it.
As someone who observed the events from the podium, in the company of L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Pramod Mahajan and others, the charge of the demolition being carefully planned by the leadership of the movement seems far-fetched — unless all of them were accomplished actors. The initial reaction to kar sevaks breaking the cordon and climbing to the top of the domes was one of bewilderment, panic and even anger. Ashok Singhal was despatched to bring things under control, but he came back with the news that things had got totally out of control. As it became apparent that there was just no way the disputed structure could be saved, the mood slowly became celebratory. Advani was perhaps the only leader whose reaction was different.
This joyousness was not surprising. For the previous four years at least, the leadership of the Ayodhya movement had campaigned vigorously for the Ram mandir to be built at the site where an earlier temple had stood, before the mosque was constructed in 1528 in the teeth of local opposition. They had consistently painted the Babri shrine as a symbol of national humiliation. Therefore, they were understandably happy that this blot on the landscape was finally being erased. To, however, deduce from their elation that they had along planned the demolition is unwarranted. From the then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao who was having an afternoon siesta while the demolition was happening, to the intelligence agencies and the state government then headed by Kalyan Singh and the top brass of the RSS, there was no anticipation that the kar sevaks would defy the leadership and take matters into their own hands. The Supreme Court was right in saying that the demolition was an “egregious violation of the rule of law” but the charge that it was the culmination of a pre-scripted plot was unproven.
The expression ‘spontaneous’ may well appear contrived to those who believe that the leadership of the Ayodhya movement must be held criminally culpable for the actions of those they had mobilised. At a political level this is understandable, not least because with the benefit of hindsight there is a belief that the demolition presented the country with a fait accompli. However, if the intention of earlier, non-BJP governments, was to punish the leaders of the Ayodhya movement through the judicial process — as opposed to confronting them politically, which was done by the dismissal of four BJP governments in the states — the charges should have been framed more appropriately. Alternatively, the CBI — and, indeed, the larger community of secular investigators — should have submitted conclusive proof of pre-meditation. On both counts there was a failure.
In 1922, as a direct consequence of the Non-Cooperation Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi, a mob in Chauri Chaura set fire to a police station and 22 policemen were burnt to death. The Mahatma accepted moral responsibility for the tragedy and unilaterally called off the movement, much to the displeasure of his Congress colleagues. Should he have been accused of criminal conspiracy to murder? Instead, he was subsequently charged with publishing seditious material, and pleaded guilty.
All said and done, this verdict brings the long-standing Ayodhya dispute to a final judicial closure. The controversy, however, will remain. The battle will shift to the realms of memory, history and, most important, politics — sites where it should have been conducted all along.

75,1617655038-184,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Hyperventilating TV Anchors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/By-order-Management/hyperventilating-tv-anchors/,Hyperventilating TV Anchors,"October 6, 2010, 7:00 AM  IST","I do not watch TV, atleast not for the past 5 odd years. Each time I have watched TV, especially our English news channels, for those few minutes during some important news event, my decision to stay away from TV has been vindicated. So, where do I get my news from? The internet. The internet and twitter are my news sources. I spend about 5 minutes on the physical newspaper each day.

On Thursday, the Ayodhya judgement was delivered in a set of cases the oldest of which dates back to the 1950s. Now to put it in perspective, that was a time when there was no me, no internet and barely any electricity. And there was no TV, leave alone cable TV, Satellite TV or mobile phones. The judgement was delivered by a set of three learned judges and the total judgement ran into approximately 8000 pages and hundred odd MB worth of data. That anybody  (apart from Robot Rajinikanth) can slice through this huge volume of data in it- without having been privy to the arguments and counter arguments and the facts placed before and examined in court – in a few minutes is unimaginable. It is humanly impossible.


Luckily (I don’t know if this is standard procedure), there was a summary verdict attached at the website, so that we could all read it and know the broad picture. And this was our friendly neighbourhood news anchors weapon of choice. And it was amazing to see news channel after news channel, anchor after screaming anchor, panel after panel twisting the words in it to their own convenience. Within a few minutes there were conclusions of judicial  overreach, the courts having gone beyond their legitimate boundaries and  pronouncements were made in the ideology that suited the anchors. I wont go into detail, but as the saying goes, smart ones only need a hint.


Armed with the internet, I was able to see the same papers that the anchors were waving furiously in the face of the camera as if it was something only they had access to. But this time, the whole world had access to it. You can get it too (Judgement Website). And as I saw through it and read it at my pace, it was evident that it was very well thought through as judgments are. This is the first ever judgement in my life which I read and I was impressed by the mass of data there. From there to take a strand or two and deliver their own ""verdict"" and impress the idiots who watch them as audience is not very difficult. However, from an ethical perspective, I don’t think it was quite there. Fortunately, there were a few sane voices apart from the anchors, some senior lawyers (Harish Salve for one) who were pointing out the errors in the anchors position then and there. 


The only equivalent I can think of is a tourist visiting the Grand Mysore palace and focussing his attention on a few bricks that seem flawed to his eye. And then deciding that the palace is flawed. The judgement is like a palace, constructed out of an argument of millions of bricks put together. My only point – please see the big picture. Read up the whole 8000 odd pages and them jump. Wherever.

     The author is right, so are lot of other opinions.  The Tv anchors actually do hyperventilate, and actually shout out and try to enforce their ideology, down my unwilling throat. They just dont allow other persons point of view, this when objectivity is the essence of journalism. It is gone on to such an extent, I actually want to abuse, bash up media people for inflicting their views on me.  Lets see what happens. Will I go to jail?...

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",i do not watch tv atleast not for the past 5 odd years each time i have watched tv especially our english news channels for those few minutes during some important news event my decision to stay away from tv has been vindicated so where do i get my news from the internet the internet and twitter are my news sources i spend about 5 minutes on the physical newspaper each dayon thursday the ayodhya judgement was delivered in a set of cases the oldest of which dates back to the 1950s now to put it in perspective that was a time when there was no me no internet and barely any electricity and there was no tv leave alone cable tv satellite tv or mobile phones the judgement was delivered by a set of three learned judges and the total judgement ran into approximately 8000 pages and hundred odd mb worth of data that anybody  apart from robot rajinikanth can slice through this huge volume of data in it without having been privy to the arguments and counter arguments and the facts placed before and examined in court – in a few minutes is unimaginable it is humanly impossibleluckily i dont know if this is standard procedure there was a summary verdict attached at the website so that we could all read it and know the broad picture and this was our friendly neighbourhood news anchors weapon of choice and it was amazing to see news channel after news channel anchor after screaming anchor panel after panel twisting the words in it to their own convenience within a few minutes there were conclusions of judicial  overreach the courts having gone beyond their legitimate boundaries and  pronouncements were made in the ideology that suited the anchors i wont go into detail but as the saying goes smart ones only need a hintarmed with the internet i was able to see the same papers that the anchors were waving furiously in the face of the camera as if it was something only they had access to but this time the whole world had access to it you can get it too judgement website and as i saw through it and read it at my pace it was evident that it was very well thought through as judgments are this is the first ever judgement in my life which i read and i was impressed by the mass of data there from there to take a strand or two and deliver their own verdict and impress the idiots who watch them as audience is not very difficult however from an ethical perspective i dont think it was quite there fortunately there were a few sane voices apart from the anchors some senior lawyers harish salve for one who were pointing out the errors in the anchors position then and there the only equivalent i can think of is a tourist visiting the grand mysore palace and focussing his attention on a few bricks that seem flawed to his eye and then deciding that the palace is flawed the judgement is like a palace constructed out of an argument of millions of bricks put together my only point – please see the big picture read up the whole 8000 odd pages and them jump wherever

As the crow flies, the distance between Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab and Dera Baba Nanak in India’s Punjab is not much more than the distance between one’s home and the neighborhood grocery store, however, the intervening land has been divided by unique historical motivations. Yesterday the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan took a fresh jab at peace in the sub-continent by invoking faith, a faith propounded by the Gurus and Granth Sahib of Sikhism, which historically developed as a middle path between Hinduism & Islam. While the ceremonial activities two days ago in Gurdaspur on the Indian side of the corridor were relatively low profile, with the Vice President, Venkaiah Naidu inaugurating the corridor, on the Pakistani side, it was a far grander ceremony with the military top brass and the entire Imran Khan Cabinet in tow.
While for India the optics around the establishment of this Kartarpur Sahib corridor have been calibrated within a realist view of the relationship, given the ongoing hostilities that continue to be perpetrated in India at the behest of the Pakistani state as well as the fact that our hands have often been burnt when we’ve first extended a hand of friendship. However, on the Pakistani side, it has been much different. This was manifested with the complete presence of the powers that be in Pakistan as well as 3000 Sikh pilgrims making their way for the ceremonial dedication of the corridor. The ambiance of the event was like a grand mushaira with comperes and dignitaries making speeches replete with grandiloquence. For Pakistan this wasn’t only a bilateral event, with the visible presence of numerous diplomats and the world’s media it was a statement of intent to the world that it’s ready to productively engage to solve historical disputes. This purpose was clear from Imran Khan’s speech wherein the context of peace with India he exhorted, “that if you (India) take one step forward in the direction of peace, we (Pakistan) will reciprocate by taking two steps.” Only time will tell if this statement of intent translates into anything tangible.
 II
While many external observers will see this event as an indication of the foreign policy to come, its domestic implications are equally, if not more important. In Imran Khan’s efforts to build a Naya Pakistan this event didn’t solely address, the constituencies of peace on both sides of the border and the world, but also articulated his government’s vision for a Pakistan that will make efforts to be more inclusive to minority groups. However, at the same time, it is well known that Pakistan is well down its path of purifying the land of the pure, where minorities in Pakistan continue to be terribly persecuted. This was seen in the recent act of Atif Mian, an Ahmedi stepping down from the National Economic Advisory Council, after tremendous pressure from conservative backers of the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government. Having said that, it’s important to note that Imran Khan on his path to Islamabad has had to make numerous concessions in the name of political expediency, and its within the realm of possibility to assume that Khan was aware that Mian’s appointment would result in considerable backlash, but made a conscious attempt to signal his vision and intent while at the same time being aware of the long journey for Pakistan to restore equality of opportunity.
The other key takeaway from yesterday’s proceedings in Kartarpur Sahib, was Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Foreign Minister of Pakistan putting the construction of this corridor in the context of Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s famous 11th of August, 1947 speech, where Jinnah laid out his vision for an inclusive Pakistan, and quoted the following lines in Urdu, “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other place of worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the state”. On hearing this, I was certain that quoting Jinnah hadn’t really been in vogue, at least from the late Zulfikar Bhutto period, given the common consensus amongst the Pakistani peoples that Jinnah’s vision as outlined above had been totally betrayed by succeeding governments and military regimes. A quick Whatsapp chat with a well-informed friend across the border confirmed that indeed referral to this speech wasn’t an everyday occurrence and that too by a Cabinet minister.
The harsh reality of Pakistan at the present moment sadly isn’t consistent with the intention on display by Khan, Qureshi and their military backers, as we’ve seen in the aftermath of the progressive Asia Bibi verdict in Pakistan’s Supreme Court. While the verdict in part avenged Salman Taseer’s assassination, Asia Bibi’s lawyers left the country knowing full well the possibility of meeting the same fate for their actions. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these words and intentions from the dais of this internationally publicized event will translate on the ground and help Pakistan’s onward march.
III
A number of factors both domestic and bilateral can help explain the Indian government’s measured and non-exuberant presence at yesterday’s event. While Navjot Sidhu and Harsimrat Kaur Badal both made deeply emotional speeches, the non-exuberant presence here translates more towards the lack of representation from the Indian Union Cabinet or from the senior advisory pool within the PMO.
Firstly, in the recent past too often has India been left stranded while extending a hand of friendship, there are a plethora of examples with the latest being the Pathankot attack shortly after Prime Minister Modi’s unannounced visit to Nawaz Sharif on Christmas in 2015.
Secondly, political compulsions of an impending general election have also shaped the government’s response to this event, most will agree that peace with Pakistan and the BJP’s bid to win re-election on the back of a call to build the Mandir in Ayodhya certainly make for strange bed-fellows.
However, the third consideration, which could possibly explain the BJP led government opting to engage with Imran Khan’s government at such a politically inopportune moment for itself, is a possible thought within the Indian security establishment that the incumbent government is one they can do business with. Prime Minister Imran Khan in his speech stated, “with respect to the relationship with India, the army and the government are now on the same page.” Post the late 2006, early 2007 period (refers to the time prior to Musharraf’s suspension of the Pakistani Chief Justice and the turmoil that resulted from the Lal Masjid attacks) there has been a lack of productive and result oriented engagement simply because the Pakistani state hasn’t found a common program within their own state. And it is only now that, prima facie, there is a sense that all government institutions in Pakistan, the military, executive, legislature and judiciary are on the same page. Therefore while this third assessment doesn’t have backing, in fact, it certainly isn’t outside the realm of possibility. This is all on the premise that the Indian government aspires to uphold Vajpayee’s legacy and wishes for a peaceful subcontinent in the future.

 Baba Nanak Sah Fakir
Hindu ka guru, musalman ka pir[1]
In the seventy years since the bloody partition of the sub-continent, numerous formulas have been adopted to reduce tensions and start a dialogue process towards healing the wounds of history. However this is the first time that Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith, a faith that was born out of a wedlock between Hinduism and Islam has been appropriated on the eve of his 550th birth anniversary to show the path of moderation to estranged neighbors as he did to his faithful band of followers long years ago. In my estimation, both countries are at present in the context of politics and civil society very divided on this question and it no doubt is a gargantuan task to translate the little momentum created by the activities at Kartarpur Sahib. However, as long as there is an ongoing effort for peace (aman ki asha) and for a structural resolution of persisting problems there is hope.

     To be perfectly honest, I found a lot more to agree with in PM Imran Khanâ  s speech than in the nightly rants of some of our most jingoistic TV anchors.

BJP’s UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, at election rallies in Delhi, has alluded to Kejriwal having links with Pakistani ministers. This, after BJP MP Parvesh Verma called Kejriwal a terrorist — a ridiculous charge repeated by Union minister Prakash Javadekar. Then, BJP’s single-point issue in the Delhi polls seems to be the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in Shaheen Bagh. Now even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dipped his hands into the murky discourse, calling the Shaheen Bagh protests a conspiracy by the political opposition.
This is absolutely inexplicable. Delhi assembly elections are supposed to be about improving administration and governance in Delhi. Local issues should take centrestage. Yet, we have BJP running a campaign that is purely based on mudslinging, dog whistle communalism and Pakistan. The CAA is not relevant to Delhi — it is a central law. Revocation of Article 370 vis-a-vis Kashmir had no connection to Delhi. The Kartarpur Corridor and the Ayodhya verdict have no relation to Delhi’s government. Again, these are local assembly elections, not national polls.
What the political parties should be debating are the condition of Delhi roads, traffic congestion, the need for more buses, the annual winter air pollution in the city, healthcare, the growing pressure on water supply, government schools, etc. BJP’s take on these everyday issues can’t be “Kejriwal has links with Pakistan”. Delhi is water stressed during the summer months not because of Shaheen Bagh protesters. And the CAA is not going to solve Delhi’s air pollution problem.
Besides, the peaceful protests in Shaheen Bagh by elderly Muslim women are hardly deserving of vilification. And if BJP thinks that the protest — which has been going on for more than a month — is inconveniencing people, it can get the Delhi Police to clear the site. After all, the Delhi Police is under the Central government, not the AAP Delhi government.
As India’s capital city, the aspirations for Delhi are big. It ought to be a world-class metropolis with state-of-the-art infrastructure. Parties fighting the Delhi elections should be putting forward their plans to effect such a transformation of the city. But BJP it seems is more interested in political polarisation than putting forward concrete policies to upgrade Delhi. The strategy might win the party votes, but it won’t do anything for Delhi’s development.

     One can understand a national party having a different perspective, owing to the nature of the duties and responsibilities of its federal government. Jaswant Singh, as EAM, held a strategic dialogue with Strobe Talbott. It irked him, when he campaigned for his seat in Jodhpur, that the residents were more interested in the quality of the drains than in the nuances of the civilian nuclear deal with the US. So the people of Delhi would not ignore fine achievements at national and international level, even if these were at a more exalted level than their day to day concerns. 2. In Bombay, the working of the BMC impacts the lives of citizens, especially slum dwellers, a lot more than the state government in Mantralaya. In Delhi, all three municipal corporations are with the ruling party for some time now. Their achievements and successes could legitimately have been presented to voters. 3. Delhiâ  s lethal air quality in winter - that encompasses all of NCR - can only be improved if the central government plays a coordinating role with state governments as far away as Punjab. More should have been attempted and achieved in the last six years. A slender Report Card....  Read More

78,1617655476-290,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ayodhya Verdict: What (still) lies underneath,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-commentary/ayodhya-verdict-what-still-lies-underneath/,Ayodhya Verdict: What (still) lies underneath,"November 18, 2019, 11:25 AM  IST","By Kevin James
In 537, the Hagia Sophia was constructed as a church in Constantinople, today’s Istanbul. In 1454, after the region became part of the Ottoman Empire, the church was converted into a mosque. In 1935, the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, secularised the monument and made it into amuseum.
But this isn’t about the Hagia Sophia, of course. A century after the conversion of the Hagia Sophia into a mosque, a masjid was built in Ayodhya during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Babur. Several centuries later, in 1992, the Babri masjid was demolished by Hindu kar sevaks who believed that it was built over the birthplace of Ram. This was following other incidents, including some damage caused to the masjid during communal riots in 1934 and the placing of Ram idols in the masjid in 1949.
Last Saturday, the Supreme Court ruled that the disputed 2.77 acre property will effectively be handed over to the Hindus. In what can be seen as reparation, the court also directed 5 acres of land at an alternative site in Ayodhya to be handed over to the Muslims.
But how were these conclusions arrived at? The judgment attempts to characterise the dispute as fundamentally regarding rival proprietary claims. In that sense, it can be said that the claim of the deity himself, a legal person represented through a next friend, succeeded. But it this was by no run-of-the-mill property dispute, and a number of contradictions emerge.
The court rightly points out that “the courts of today cannot take cognisance of historical rights and wrongs unless it is shown that their legal consequences are enforceable in the present”. To ascertain this enforceability in the present dispute, four distinct legal regimes are identified — pre-Mughal, Mughal, colonial and post-independence constitutional. Unless the new sovereign recognises pre-existing rights, no court can enforce the same.
On this basis, the court correctly concluded that only actions subsequent to 1856, when the British annexed Awadh, form the basis of the legal rights of the parties in the present dispute.
In a seeming contradiction, one of the reasons why the Supreme Court didn’t accept the Muslim claim was because it could not be proven that the inner courtyard of the property was subject to exclusive use by Muslims from 1528 to 1857. A similarly rigorous burden of proof is conspicuously absent in the court’s treatment of the Hindu claim. In the latter’s case, proof regarding exclusive control of the outer courtyard and frequent contestations regarding the inner courtyard were somehow deemed sufficient for vesting the entire property in them.
There is another consequence of the proposition that courts can only look into those historical wrongs that are currently enforceable in law. In this case, surely the actions carrying legal consequences ought to be the damage done to the masjid in 1934, the placing of Hindu idols in 1949, and the demolition of the masjid in 1992 — not its construction in 1528? Despite this, the judgment grants the entire site to the Hindus after an analysis of the consistency of their beliefs over time, and grants to the Muslims only an alternative site.
Even though the judgment declares in no uncertain terms that the aforesaid actions “constituted a serious violation of the rule of law”, it is hard to see how its ultimate verdict is not tantamount to a retrospective vindication of the actions of 1992. Equally difficult to see is the court’s use of Article 142 in granting some land to the Muslims at an alternative site as having achieved ‘complete justice’.
Significantly, the judgment sings paeans to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which guarantees that the religious character of places of public worship, as they existed on August 15, 1947, will be preserved. The court went so far as to say that “the law speaks to our history and to the future of the nation”, that “historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking the law in their own hands”, and that “history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future”.
But what was the point of citing this law? After all, it explicitly excludes the Ayodhya dispute from its ambit. That being said, if Parliament’s intention in passing such a law was seen as furthering constitutional goals and deemed praiseworthy, it was surely open to the apex court to apply the same principles to the Ayodhya dispute, even though the statute itself does not apply. It appears as if, in the case of Babri masjid and here alone, an alleged (and not conclusively proven) historical wrong can, in fact, be remedied by the people taking the law in their own hands and oppressing the present.
GoI now has to formulate a scheme within three months and establish a trust that will oversee the construction of the temple. Many hope that the final judicial determination of this long-drawn dispute will draw a sordid chapter of history to a close.
In India today, one can hardly imagine a resolution in the manner envisaged by Ataturk. But even in Turkey, the current president has indicated his intention to convert the Hagia Sophia museum into a mosque again. Even in secular republics, religious scars don’t heal easily.

     Sir when you start off with a wrong (unfair) ""frame of reference"" you cannot deliver real justice. How can you say that the courts ""CORRECTLY"" concluded that 1856 should be the cut off year after which the actions should be considered as the basis for the legal dispute?. Were the Hindus consulted on which should be the cut off date?.  If Hindus had been asked they would have flatly rejected this. If there is evidence that a temple existed below the mosque the regardless of when this ""change of ownership"" happened, the property should be restored to the original owner, of course compensation should be given to today's owners as they weren't the original squatters. That's all. When Hindus have the proof of existence of their place of worship why should they accept some arbitrary ""cut off date"" which weakens their case ? They will not. In the case of the crimes against Kashmir pandits the SC had ruled that it cannot be reopened as 30 years have passed and the evidences may be difficult to find. But in the case of a temple being destroyed and another structure being built under on top of it, the evidence exists  even after hundreds of years have passed. The courts should not worry about the time that has passed in such property disputes but only look at valid evidence. Looking at a different way, if it could be proved that the Hindu temple was a symbol of something bad and if the mosque that was built after demolishing it was actually a symbol of something good , a symbol of brotherhood and equality then by all means the mosque should stay. But history tells us why the mosque was built and everyone is aware of this....  Read More

              Mumbai Police fall from 26/11 martyrdom to the planting of an explosive-laden car outside Antilia",by kevin jamesin 537 the hagia sophia was constructed as a church in constantinople todays istanbul in 1454 after the region became part of the ottoman empire the church was converted into a mosque in 1935 the founder of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk secularised the monument and made it into amuseumbut this isnt about the hagia sophia of course a century after the conversion of the hagia sophia into a mosque a masjid was built in ayodhya during the reign of the mughal emperor babur several centuries later in 1992 the babri masjid was demolished by hindu kar sevaks who believed that it was built over the birthplace of ram this was following other incidents including some damage caused to the masjid during communal riots in 1934 and the placing of ram idols in the masjid in 1949last saturday the supreme court ruled that the disputed 277 acre property will effectively be handed over to the hindus in what can be seen as reparation the court also directed 5 acres of land at an alternative site in ayodhya to be handed over to the muslimsbut how were these conclusions arrived at the judgment attempts to characterise the dispute as fundamentally regarding rival proprietary claims in that sense it can be said that the claim of the deity himself a legal person represented through a next friend succeeded but it this was by no runofthemill property dispute and a number of contradictions emergethe court rightly points out that the courts of today cannot take cognisance of historical rights and wrongs unless it is shown that their legal consequences are enforceable in the present to ascertain this enforceability in the present dispute four distinct legal regimes are identified — premughal mughal colonial and postindependence constitutional unless the new sovereign recognises preexisting rights no court can enforce the sameon this basis the court correctly concluded that only actions subsequent to 1856 when the british annexed awadh form the basis of the legal rights of the parties in the present disputein a seeming contradiction one of the reasons why the supreme court didnt accept the muslim claim was because it could not be proven that the inner courtyard of the property was subject to exclusive use by muslims from 1528 to 1857 a similarly rigorous burden of proof is conspicuously absent in the courts treatment of the hindu claim in the latters case proof regarding exclusive control of the outer courtyard and frequent contestations regarding the inner courtyard were somehow deemed sufficient for vesting the entire property in themthere is another consequence of the proposition that courts can only look into those historical wrongs that are currently enforceable in law in this case surely the actions carrying legal consequences ought to be the damage done to the masjid in 1934 the placing of hindu idols in 1949 and the demolition of the masjid in 1992 — not its construction in 1528 despite this the judgment grants the entire site to the hindus after an analysis of the consistency of their beliefs over time and grants to the muslims only an alternative siteeven though the judgment declares in no uncertain terms that the aforesaid actions constituted a serious violation of the rule of law it is hard to see how its ultimate verdict is not tantamount to a retrospective vindication of the actions of 1992 equally difficult to see is the courts use of article 142 in granting some land to the muslims at an alternative site as having achieved complete justicesignificantly the judgment sings paeans to the places of worship special provisions act 1991 which guarantees that the religious character of places of public worship as they existed on august 15 1947 will be preserved the court went so far as to say that the law speaks to our history and to the future of the nation that historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking the law in their own hands and that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the futurebut what was the point of citing this law after all it explicitly excludes the ayodhya dispute from its ambit that being said if parliaments intention in passing such a law was seen as furthering constitutional goals and deemed praiseworthy it was surely open to the apex court to apply the same principles to the ayodhya dispute even though the statute itself does not apply it appears as if in the case of babri masjid

79,1617655389-269,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The Ayodhya Judgment: C-L-I-P-P-E-R …. BOAT!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Outraged/the-ayodhya-judgment-c-l-i-p-p-e-r-boat/,The Ayodhya Judgment: C-L-I-P-P-E-R …. BOAT!,"November 10, 2019, 8:04 PM  IST","I knew a lovable five-year old once, who knew his alphabet as well as his illustrated alphabet book intimately. The book went ‘A for APPLE, ‘B for BOAT, and so on. The kid could read the entire book, even if you opened a page at random, by calling out each word alphabet by alphabet. For instance, he would go: A-P-P-L-E – Apple; B-O-A-T – Boat; …. H-O-R-S-E – Horse and so on. Once, curious, whether he had actually learnt to read I once put a different primer in front of the kid. The page opened on C for CLIPPER, with the picture of a boat. The kid went C-L-I-P-P-E-R – Boat!
To me, the Supreme Court judgment on the Ayodhya dispute sounds suspiciously similar. Each observation the Supreme Court has made about Ayodhya, the temple, the mosque and the history and so on is correct, but the conclusion hardly follows logically.
Well, the SC’s judgment is like a child calling out each letter of the word C-L-I-P-P-E-R correctly, but pronouncing the final word as Boat. And this is where one feels let down by the judgment. The disappointment lies not in the verdict itself but in the lack of logic as articulated, or not articulated, in the judgment.
But then, one may be entirely wrong in looking for logic in a judgment, as it is said, the life of the law is not logic; it is experience. But if so, which experience may the SC be germane to the SC’s judgment in this case?
True, a judgment may seem illogical for any of the following reasons, when:
a) A court could take a short cut to a judgment by taking a word or a theme literally, ignoring a broader context of an issue on hand. In such a situation, asking for irrefutable logic may appear as being unduly finicky. But this is a 1045-page judgment, and whatever else the judgment is, a short-cut to anything it is not.
b) A court gets inventive with the result or the judgment, rather than the interpretation leading to the judgment, even as the judgment is wrapped in syllogisms and verbal delicacy. Could that be the case here?
c) A court is faced with rules of law which are seemingly inconsistent, while in truth, the principle underlying one may not embody the other. For example, one may not be able to state categorically “If a, then b,” but only “If a, then usually b (but not always).” Such a situation could well have been possible given the historic nature of the dispute going back centuries. But if so, the judgment does not enlighten us with such dichotomies.
d) A court may deliberately maintain a principle only to negate a pre-existing contrary principle, as if deliberately moving away from consistency and reason. While lack of consistency and reason seems evident in the decision, it is not clear which contradiction in the principle(s) involved may have led to the judgment.
e) A judge operates as an “automaton with no more give and take in his mind than you will find in a terrier watching a rathole.” (to quote H.L. Mencken). We could equally quote an Arjuna staring at nothing but the eye of the bird But in this case we had a full five of them. Are we to understand none of them looked at anything other than a rathole or the narrow eye of the bird?
Well, I suppose for the judgment to be truly acceptable to all the parties involved, perhaps their Lordships should have taken the trouble to explain how their awarding of the entire premises to the one, leaving the other high and dry, except for kind and gracious words, followed from their many observations.
At this rate, we may well one day have the Sabarimala judgment which may observe that women and men have equal rights in all respects as per the Indian Constitution; that all Indians are free to follow their faith of choice; that all Indians have equal access to worship deities of their choice, irrespective of their caste or gender; that it is time women were given an equal place in the society as men in modern-day India… And therefore, going forward, women will be restricted from entering Sabrimala.

     Sorry Sir. The SC did say CLIPPER ..CLIPPER, just that you missed it. The court said that if we allot title based on the structure then once it was a mosque but once it was a temple too. So the criteria the court used is whomsover is able to prove longest period of worship gets the title. One side provided, the other did not. Imagine even when the structure was a mosque, i am talking pre 1856 era, hindu devotees went there to pray. They always thought it was the birth place. So what does this mean. RAM. Lalla was always there in the minds of devotee. He is the real owner and really speaking the real winner in many senses is the devotee. God cannot exist without a devotee.Sorry professor life and hence justice is not just cold logic, rather hard evidence based logic mixed with true empathy. Please try and understand....

Why relook it?","March 14, 2021, 7:57 PM  IST","Supreme Court’s move to examine the validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act is unfortunate. Parliament enacted the law in 1991 to prevent conversion of religious places and maintain their “religious character” as it existed on August 15, 1947, with sole exception carved out for the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute – already in courts by then. The Act won high praise from the 2019 SC bench that awarded the disputed land in Ayodhya to Hindus, noting that it “addresses itself to the State as much as to every citizen” and that its norms “bind those who govern the affairs of the nation at every level”.
This law praised by SC has been challenged by a PIL, a mechanism many judges now frown upon for their tendency to arrogate governance and bog down judiciary in matters with no constitutional or justiciable issues at stake. The petitioner has opposed the Independence Day cutoff as “arbitrary, irrational and retrospective”, which prohibits Hindus and others from approaching courts to “reclaim” worship places “invaded” and “encroached” upon by “fundamentalist barbaric invaders”.
Ironically, the petition is guilty of much arbitrariness and irrationality, which wasn’t seized to dismiss it. India was founded as a modern, secular nation on August 15, 1947. Much of ancient and medieval history was barbaric and sacrileges aplenty were committed. The modern Republic can’t retrospectively entertain grievances lost in the mists of time. It can’t be stuck in 1192, nor can it undermine its Constitution predicated upon rule of law to correct history or its many versions. Indeed, the Republic has to be future-oriented, accountable as it is to citizenry demanding fulfilment of their aspirations of development and material prosperity in the present day, rather than raking up events of a millennium ago (the latter, indeed, is a hallmark of fundamentalist thinking).
The premise of August 15, 1947, was a break with history, guaranteeing equal rights to all people and freedom from discrimination. This foundational character was present in the 1991 law. SC’s Ramjanmabhoomi verdict concurs: “Parliament determined that independence from colonial rule furnishes a constitutional basis for healing the injustices of the past. … The State, has by enacting the law, enforced a constitutional commitment and operationalised its constitutional obligations to uphold the equality of all religions and secularism which is a part of the Constitution’s basic structure.” Entertaining such PILs opens a Pandora’s box – to avoid which, precisely, this law was enacted. The judiciary mustn’t open minefields with no major constitutional issue at stake.

     I am appalled to read your comments and deeply disappointed by your advice to judiciary justifying time limit over judicial prudence. Political decision to put time limit was nothing more than appeasement which you have tried to defend. Some day later, you may advise supreme court not to consider return of Hindus from Kashmir and forget. Is not shameful?...  Read More

The problem is that the verdict perverts the law and paves the ground for fresh hostility against the minorities 

The Supreme Court must redeem the law, enabling a compromise that respects both faith and minority rights


MR

KRISHNA Yadav, alias Krishna Vasudev, you stand accused of a long list

of unlawful acts, ranging from minor misdemeanours all the way to mass

murder. As a child, you indulged in petty theft, as a young man, you

are charged with assorted acts of sexual misconduct ranging from

violating the modesty of women on the banks of the Yamuna to adultery.

You stand accused of causing serious environmental damage, by uprooting

an entire mountain. In adulthood, your crimes become more serious: you

are charged with multiple counts of regicide, polygamy on a grand

scale, embracing 16,000-odd wives, instigating dishonourable conduct on

the battlefield against the rules of combat, resulting in the death of

two kings. Finally, one Gandhari has accused you of mass murder,

producing thousands of widows and orphans. What do you have to say in

your defence?"" 
    Such

a chargesheet is conceivable, now that the Ayodhya verdict has

converted gods into historical individuals, after colonial

jurisprudence had converted Hindu gods into juridical entities who can

sue and be sued. In his defence, Krishna would have no option but to

tell the judge that different yardsticks apply to gods and to men, that

what might appear criminal in a mortal might be supremely just and

noble in a god, that the codes of meaning and significance embedded in

actions lend themselves to multiple interpretations, the sublime of

which would be valid while evaluating godly conduct. Gods transcend

man’s morality and ethics, in fact, are outside the compass of human

law. 
    Conversion of a god into a human who, were he to stray

into a Maharashtra village, might be issued a 12-digit unique identity,

is but one of the verdict’s deficiencies. 
    But should we

discuss the deficiencies of the judgment when the nation is keen to

move on? Doesn’t the verdict offer a workable compromise to resolve the

dispute, separate politics from religion and let the nation focus on

economic growth and prosperity? Isn’t splitting hair over the verdict

an attempt to breathe fire into the dying embers of Muslim anger? 
    Such

reasoning glosses over some cracks that have the potential to grow into

deep tectonic faults. The country should move forward and a compromise

is desirable — unquestionably. But should the compromise be forged by

the courts? Does the particular manner in which the compromise has been

forged work towards inter-community peace or does it pave the ground

for fresh hostility? It is vital to answer these questions. 
    Courts

are meant to enforce the writ of the Constitution, the bedrock of

institutional protection of minority rights, crucial for cohesion in

our composite, diverse nation. If the courts choose pragmatism over the

law, they would fail the Constitution, and erode the trust of different

minority groupings in the state’s institutional commitment to protect

minority rights. If compromise has to be struck, going beyond the law’s

remit, the courts should not get involved or, if it feels that a

compromise is warranted, say

explicitly that the matter is beyond legal resolution and the parties

should find a settlement outside the law. This has a precedent. The

Kerala High Court declared, delivering its verdict on a protracted

squabble among different Christian denominations, that the matter was

for the court of god to decide, not for the court of man. This forced

the parties to the dispute to work out a compromise. 
    The

Allahabad High Court’s compromise has multiple infirmities. We already

saw how it degrades faith, converting gods into historical individuals.

Then it uses faith to justify property title. Why should not the

‘faithful’ now grab additional real estate? They only need to prove a

sufficient mass of faith and invoke the Ayodhya precedent to get what

they want. Demands on Kashi and Mathura have already been raised. 
    The

verdict constructs history (locating Ram’s birthplace) and deconstructs

it, dismissing 400 odd years of intervening history in deciding the

legal status of the disputed title. This is perverse use of the law. 
    The

Supreme Court must redeem the law, exorcising these infirmities from

the body of Indian jurisprudence. The political import of the verdict

is to lend legitimacy to the campaign to demolish the mosque. This is

another reason to oppose the verdict. 
    This is not to say that

faith carries no weight. On the contrary. In the Ramayana, when Bharat

visits Ram in exile to request his return to the throne, Ram asks after

his people. In particular, he asks after the Charvakas, a group of

non-conforming atheists and materialists. If this minority on the

margins is fine, the mainstream is assuredly so — this was the

political ethics that Gandhi championed by his term Ramarajya. In that

Ram’s name, the Sangh Parivar has sought to excoriate today’s

minorities and demolished the mosque. That is perversion of faith,

endorsed by the Ayodhya verdict . 
    We need a remedial verdict

from the Supreme Court and a new compromise outside the courts, based

on respect for both faith and minority rights.

82,1617655053-188,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The secular fundamentalist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/headon/the-secular-fundamentalist/,The secular fundamentalist,"June 20, 2013, 2:04 PM  IST","The next general election, says Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, will be a battle between “communal and secular forces.” He’s right. But who represents these two “forces”? And how do you define communalism and secularism? Is Nitish Kumar secular? Is Narendra Modi communal? Has L.K. Advani suddenly morphed from being communal to being secular? Does Sonia Gandhi represent secularism? 
I attempted answers to some of these questions here and here. 
In the final analysis, the 2014 Lok Sabha poll will be a referendum on the ideologies of Sonia Gandhi and Narendra Modi. Sonia’s stewardship of the Congress has demonstrated that she stands for the following: 
1: Secularism;
2: Welfarism;
3: Inclusive growth. 
All are unexceptionable in theory but problematic in practice. Consider each:  
Secularism: The classical definition of secularism is simple: keeping religion out of the public domain. The definition of communalism is equally straightforward: using religion to win votes by offering job, educational or other quotas to, for example, Muslims or pandering, for example, to Hindus over emotive issues like building a Ram temple at Ayodhya. In short, religion is private. Keep it at home.  
The brand of secularism the Congress has practised for decades has been economically and socially detrimental to Muslims. Outcome, not intent, is the only real test of a policy targeted at a specific community. By that test, the secularism of the Congress – and of the JD(U), SP and NCP in their respective states – fails the test.  
Welfarism: India’s fiscal profligacy, since especially 2011, has led to low economic growth, inflation and a falling rupee. Much of this profligacy is predicated on the Congress’s welfarism. This has been opposed by the Prime Minister. But he has often been – unconstitutionally – vetoed by Sonia.  
Inclusive Growth: Economists ranging from Keynes to Friedman have stressed that, without growth, inclusion becomes irrelevant. But inclusive growth is possible only if there is growth. Instead, the UPA’s nine years in office have become better known for inclusive corruption.  
Turn now to the ideology of Sonia’s principal political rival – Narendra Modi. His definition of secularism has been articulated as India First – nation above all else. This stands up to scrutiny – in theory. In practice, the outcome will emerge only in the fullness of time.  
On welfarism, Modi clearly prefers a private sector, industry-driven model. This has worked well in Gujarat though health and social indicators need to catch up with the manufacturing sector before Modi’s economic model can be declared a complete success.  
On inclusive growth, Modi says he works for “six crore Gujaratis, not six crore Hindus and Muslims”. Again, that’s impeccable in theory. In practice, Muslims in Gujarat are indeed better off than Muslims, for example, in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Assam. But inclusiveness is an ongoing project. It needs constant attention and improvement.  
Author Amish Tripathi recently wrote: “The answer to religious extremism is not secular extremism, but religious liberalism. This leads one to the obvious question: what is liberalism? For in modern Indian public debate, the definition of liberalism has been distorted. Being liberal is very often misconstrued as being leftist. But I have met many leftists who are as illiberal as the right-wing extremists they oppose. We have to realize that religious extremism will only be defeated by religious liberalism, not by ivory-tower, secular, homilies from our elite.” (Emphasis added).  
Digvijaya Singh, as I said at the start, is right in declaring 2014 a contest between secular and communal forces. But his party has too often preached the former and practised the latter. 
In less than 10 months, a young, aspirational Indian electorate, interested in corruption-free, decisive governance and jobs, not religious extremism or dressed-up secularism, will deliver a verdict.  
If that verdict places real secularism, and not the fraudulent variety manufactured by some parties, at the heart of Indian society, religion will no longer be held hostage to political opportunists.

83,1617655094-197,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,1992 and now: How the Ram mandir battle is different,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/right-and-wrong/1992-and-now-how-the-ram-mandir-battle-is-different/,1992 and now: How the Ram mandir battle is different,"November 4, 2018, 10:59 AM  IST","Hindus, it is said, have an expansive sense of time. To that extent, a Supreme Court decision that, in effect, pushes back any decision on the title suit of the disputed site in Ayodhya to well beyond the general election of 2019 may well be inconsequential. After all, what are few months or even a year in a battle that has been ongoing for at least 150 years, if not more? Having waited for generations for an apparent historical wrong to be corrected, it is possible that the aggrieved will wait even more without too much fuss.
Whether the judiciary has its own priorities or is guilty of prevarication is for history to judge. What is, however, undeniable is that an apparent lack of urgency has always had profound consequences. Had the courts settled the title dispute in the 1950s, the course of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement may well have taken a different turn and remained localised. It could also be said that had the Supreme Court not returned the Presidential reference on determining if a temple had indeed predated the mosque built in 1528, the terms of the dispute would have been very different. Judicial verdicts invariably have consequences but so do the absence of decisions.
The immediate reaction to the Supreme Court’s new timetable has been an enhanced sense of Hindu victimhood. In the political sphere, there is a clear divide between those who feel that Hindu sentiments are being trampled upon, whether in Ayodhya or Sabarimala, and those who are gleeful that Narendra Modi and the BJP have been denied an opportunity to play the Ayodhya card in 2019. There is a ‘secular’ calculation that the Hindu mahants who are at the forefront of the Ram temple movement will either take their frustration out on the BJP or force the Narendra Modi government into a bout of self-defeating adventurism. Either way, the legal delay is expected to create complications for the present government.
To, however, imagine that the present muddle will automatically result in a repetition of the stir that began with the Ram shilan pujas in 1988-89 and culminated in the demolition of December 6, 1992, is a little far-fetched. Although the age-old dispute shows no sign of abating and the proposed Ram temple is still a blueprint, India has changed, as has the political context.
First, there has been a profound shift in the mood. Earlier, along with the Ram temple movement, there was a simultaneous battle to secure the recognition of Hindus as a distinct political entity, perhaps as an alternative to the surfeit of ‘minorityism’. Today, that battle has been resoundingly won. While there is a residual sense of victimhood, there is also a clear understanding in mainstream politics that Hindu sentiments can neither be disregarded nor offset by creating a coalition of minorities. ‘Secular fundamentalism’ built on the assumption that the Hindu voice can be taken for granted is politically unworkable today.
Secondly, the earlier round of the Ayodhya battle was dominated by a contrived tussle between history and faith. Historians played an important role in trying to demonstrate that the stories of a destroyed temple in Ayodhya were fiction. The Allahabad High Court judgment of 2010, basing its conclusions on archaeological reports and the examination of ‘secular’ historians, concluded that a big temple had indeed existed where the Babri Masjid had been built.
Consequently, the present battle is characterised by the strange silence of the historians who had been most vocal in the 1990s. Reduced to bare essentials, the issue today centres on where and how Muslim interests will be accommodated after the Ram temple is built.
Finally, the earlier Ayodhya mobilisation occurred in an India that was experiencing the dying gasps of an inefficient, over-regulated economy. Today’s India is far more prosperous, globalised, self-confident and, above all, connected. The impulses that allowed for mass rallies, disruption and even rioting are clearly absent from today’s society. At the same time, religiosity is far more pronounced and complemented by supra-local networks built on technology. While there may be an abhorrence of turmoil, the outpouring of sentiment that propelled the Ram temple movement to the centre stage has, in fact, been strengthened. To project Hindu self-assertion by the parameters of an earlier era would be a miscalculation.
The challenge for the Ram temple movement lies in tempering a long-standing grievance with the parallel yearnings for stability, order, prosperity and national self-esteem. Provoking explosions of frustration isn’t always a prudent response to a challenge. Simmering anger plus exemplary restraint may be more rewarding.

The feast day appears on 1st January in the liturgical calendar hence we celebrate the new year.
2019 has been a memorable journey for us as a Nation. Starting from Balakot Strikes to brave wing commander Abhinandan, From the second tenure of NDA government to demystifying Article 370 & 35 – A, Further from Triple talaq to Ayodhya verdict. Going beyond the borders from Mr. Trudeau being head of Canadian Cabinet to Mr. Johnson taking over as Britain’s prime minister for his decisive role in Brexit.
2020 [Twenty-Twenty] with a bonus day in February is going to be a remarkable year in terms of world history as 59th quadrennial US presidential elections are going to be held. Further, the most awaited Brexit deal between the EU and the British government to be concluded. The Greatest sporting showpiece in the world i.e. Tokyo Olympics is scheduled in mid-2020 and a lot more
We are already into the wee hours of the leap year. It is usually said, “Well begun is half done”. So let’s flip the calendar with few more resolutions. The most important aspect that needs to be addressed today is the economic slowdown which has already started hitting a common man. Every single organization has a vision and mission. Our county has the vision to be a developed nation and our mission is to be a 5 trillion economy by 2025 which can be achieved by the teamwork of 28 + 9 teams.
Despite the economic slowdown, India is still one of the fastest-growing economies around the globe. The world observes India as an asset for its plethora of consumer base which highlights our importance at economic and social grounds. Economic, Industrial and banking reforms are the need of the hour which are already a part of the government’s pipeline. Railway Revamp, Bank Mergers, CDS of all three forces are good signals for our nation. Being the citizens of this beautiful nation let us take a few more resolutions to be more responsible, more honest & most importantly more supportive citizens of our motherland India.

85,1617655031-182,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"India’s racing ahead, but are we on track?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/cursor/india-s-racing-ahead-but2/,"India’s racing ahead, but are we on track?","October 4, 2010, 4:50 PM  IST","INDIA is getting ready to play. The government’s chief economist says India will soon overtake China as the world’s fastest growing economy. So it would, concurs a Morgan Stanley study, based on the expected demographic dividend as the share of the non-working, dependent population shrinks, boosting not only the share of active workers but also the savings required to finance massive investment. Foreign direct investment inflows of the magnitude that the world envied China for, for much of the last couple of decades, is now flowing into India. Indians themselves are aggressive outward investors, and investment promotion outfits of most advanced countries woo Indian capital. 
   The president of the United States warns his country’s children that if they don’t study hard, Indian children will eat their jobs. Indian enterprise is respected, even feared, as being capable of devouring good, middle-American jobs, if business process outsourcing is not curbed. 
   Indian managers are making their mark around the world. Indra Nooyi, Vikram Pandit and Anshu Jain have steered their ships with great elan over the choppy waters of the financial and economic crisis, to the far shore of greater profitability. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s views are received with respect and attention, when leaders of the world meet, to discuss globally coordinated solutions to global problems. 
   Yes, on most counts, India would indeed seem to be getting ready to play. So it would seem appropriate that India should host a major sporting event like the Commonwealth Games. However, the manner in which we went about organising them, producing a sordid tale of incompetence, corruption and shoddiness that has been unfolding in daily installments to public shock and horror, has made us hang our heads in shame. 
   But this is not all. The nation was on edge on September 30th, when a high court delivered its verdict on a disputed shrine at Ayodhya. The police forces were on full alert in all parts of the country. Several states had issued prohibitory orders, closed schools and colleges, in anticipation of violence that is no less menacing for its eventual non-occurrence. Should a nation about to take wing be cringing at its own reflection morphed through a prism of anger? The insurgencies in Kashmir and the north-east and by the Maoists, the concept of honour that impels father and brother to kill daughter and sister, the skewed distribution o social power that makes Dalits easy prey to the greed and lust of upper caste miscreant, the custom and mores that make even the Capital’s Metro provide exclusive compartments for women and, every so often, send a doctor off to jail for conducting pre-natal sex determination tests, what do all these tell us about the state of the Union? If this is preparation for play, what macabre sport are we preparing for? 
Yes, there is ugliness in our midst that the opening ceremony spectacle or Shera, the Games mascot’s smile or the colourful screens planted strategically all along the route the foreign athletes would travel cannot conceal. But India is not just chaos and dirt and violence. If there is one thing that suffuses India’s collective consciousness today as never before, it is hope — hope that things would improve, drastically, and for everyone. Without hope for the future, there can be neither joy in the present, nor creative action. But there is, indeed, hope, and joy, and plenty of action. India is indeed prepared to play. Let the games play on!

86,1617655461-286,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,A socio-judicial analysis of the Ayodhya Verdict (To be referred to henceforth as the ‘Ram Mandir Title Suit’),https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/Undertheinfluence/a-socio-judicial-analysis-of-the-ayodhya-verdict-to-be-referred-to-henceforth-as-the-ram-mandir-title-suit/,A socio-judicial analysis of the Ayodhya Verdict (To be referred to henceforth as the ‘Ram Mandir Title Suit’),"November 9, 2019, 1:41 PM  IST","Now that a section of Hindus (to be referred to henceforth as ‘Hindus’) has been given the right to build a Ram mandir at the disputed site in Ayodhya, inter-denominational (to be referred to henceforth as ‘social’) amity should descend on India once and for all, proving the till-now doubted efficacy of the ‘trickle-down’ phenomenon.
This, in turn, will redouble the nation’s focus on reaching the goal towards economic prosperity (to be referred to henceforth as ‘a Rs 5 trillion economy’).
That a section of Muslims (to be referred to henceforth as ‘Muslims’) has been given a tract of land in Ayodhya (the location of which is yet to be determined) to build a masjid is also welcome. This way, the Supreme Court has used common sense (to be referred to as ‘judicial judgment’) to put a closure on an issue that has been on the agenda of a moderately modernist, forward-looking nation since at least the late 1980s (to be referred to henceforth as ‘centuries’).
The simplicity of Saturday’s verdict may make commentators criticise, or even question it. The judgment may even resurrect the notion of a new-found demand for ‘many Ayodhyas’ (to be referred henceforth as ‘Mathura and Kashi’). But by expecto patronum, and in special cases such as locations with ‘living’ mosques and dargahs, wingardium leviosa, Saturday’s verdict ensures that this decision pertaining to Ayodhya is restricted to Ayodhya (to be referred to henceforth as ‘wahi’ (there), in contradistinction to ‘yehi’ (here), in the context of ‘Mandir wahi banega’).
All in all, the Supreme Court verdict has allowed both the State and the citizenry (in conjunction to be referred to henceforth as ‘India’) to now focus on other matters pertaining to governance, development, social and economic prosperity, and the keeping of law and order. In other words, in the building, completion and maintenance in perpetuo of a sidelined national project that is inclusive as well as extensive (to be referred to henceforth as ‘Ram Rajya’).

Some of the statements are contemptuous of the Supreme Court, while others seek to build a momentum with intent to rally those clamouring for immediate construction of the temple.
On November 28, 2018, senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar warned that the country is not so handicapped for “two-three” judges or the court to “throttle its beliefs” by delaying construction of a Ram temple. This suggests that RSS will not brook any delay in the construction of the temple notwithstanding what the Supreme Court does.
He went on to say that the Chief Justice of India, in deferring the hearing till January, in fact “delayed, denied and disrespected” the sentiments of the people and if the three judges are not ready to deliver justice, they should “think if they want to remain judges or resign”. I guess, delivering justice means justice in tandem with the wishes of RSS.

The site at Ayodhya turned into a fortress. Shiv Sena, with a show of strength, sought to steal a march over BJP by reminding it of the unfulfilled promise of building a temple. The decision of RSS and VHP to hold a mega rally in Delhi last month at Ram Leela Maidan, where close to 8 lakh people were expected to gather (though it turned out to be a tepid affair), had a two-fold objective. First, to send a not so subtle message to the Supreme Court. Second, to take initial steps to gain popular support and polarise India along religious lines, just before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.
Along with this is the veiled threat publicly made that the state is not powerless since it will consider intervention through the ordinance route to pre-empt any delay in receiving justice, consistent with the wishes of those who are voicing their protests.
On November 26, 2018, BJP party president Amit Shah stated the ruling party believes that Ram mandir should be constructed in Ayodhya, the place of birth of Lord Ram. He further said “we are expecting a favourable judgment”. On December 19 Shah made yet another provocative statement: “I feel the case should be cleared at the earliest … it is important to a lot of people … sentiments of people across the country.”
HRD minister Prakash Javadekar followed it up by stating on December 24: “Our wish is that there should be a daily hearing on that matter so that we have an early judgment.” The law minister said the same day: “I want to make an appeal to the Supreme Court, not as law minister but as a citizen to fast-track the hearing.” BJP general secretary Ram Madhav also wanted the case on fast track, if not, other options would be explored.
The surge in building a sentiment and issuing veiled threats to the court is meant to convey that if the matter is not heard immediately, other options would be adopted. This interferes with the due process of law.
On a suggestion made to the court that the matter should be heard after the elections in 2019, BJP alleged that counsel attempted to influence the court. But the flurry of statements made in the last several months and now at the cusp of the hearing does not amount to attempting to influence courts. So much for double standards.
These are crass attempts to pressurise the court, nothing short of contempt of court. Those making such statements should be aware of the fact that during the course of the hearing in the high court, an order was passed on August 20, 2002 and modified on February 17, 2003. The order directs that the media should not express its opinion on the court proceedings, or express opinion of any person including any party or his counsel.
On October 30, 2015, the Supreme Court confirmed the order of February 17, 2003, stating that “We further direct that interim directions issued by the high court in terms of its order dated August 20, 2002, as modified by its order of February 17, 2003, continue to be operative pending further orders of this Court.”
It is surprising that the law minister and other distinguished members of this government as well as state governments where BJP is in power, have made public statements in contravention of these orders. This amounts to contempt of court.
The Supreme Court is well aware that a matter which has grave implications for the future of India, whichever way it is decided, should not be subject to public discourse to vitiate the fundamentals of our democratic polity. It is one thing to say in court that it is a title suit; it is another matter when you convert it into an expression of faith to make the proceedings before the court irrelevant, if not decided in a particular way.
Such statements are symptomatic of a mindset that pays scant respect to the rule of law and the majesty of justice. Politics in this mindset is above the law. So are the men who play politics.

     Mr Kapil Sibbal , through your blog , are you trying to say that the highest court of law and the judges are so weak in their minds and thoughts that they get influenced by the appeals and statements made by the politicians of the day. If that was the case, how many times in the past , when you and your party were in power made such unwarranted statements on the subjects and issues pending before the judiciary that may have influenced the verdicts? As a lawyer of best repute , the expressions is purely political, not of any legal importance....  Read More

Advocates in the case have pointed out that a 1994 judgment by a five-judge bench had said that a mosque was not an integral part of Islam, a doubtful proposition which would need to be reconsidered by a larger bench. Given the importance of this case, it would be fitting for the entire matter to be considered by the full weight of a larger bench.
The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of appeals against the Allahabad high court 2010 verdict, which had partitioned the disputed property three ways. Not only did no party seek or accept this, it trivialised the dispute. There is a swirl of contending narratives around the site – it has been pitched as a battle between rashtra purush Ram and foreign invader Babar, and as a confrontation between an India where religious communities are equal and one where the majority wins. But the Supreme Court did well last month by treating the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi as a pure land dispute, the implication being that it should be settled according to existing property laws.
This clears a lot of clutter as it means that only hard facts and legal arguments are admissible; not suppositions, sentiments or intentions. By the same token sundry do gooders, mediators, saints, gurus and legal eagles need to be kept out except those who are immediate parties to the dispute. It’s important that a judgment be delivered on legal considerations by a bench of at least five judges, and thereafter respected and implemented by all parties concerned while ensuring that communal harmony is not disrupted under any circumstances.

With this a total of seven litigants – including those under the aegis of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind – have declared their intention to go for review. The apex court had ordered the Centre to set up a trust to build a Ram temple on the 2.77-acre disputed land where the demolished Babri Masjid once stood. Meanwhile, it had allotted five acres of land for the construction of a mosque at a prominent place in Ayodhya.    
Given the complexity of the case, the Supreme Court tried hard to be fair to all sides. However, some Muslim litigants are still not fully satisfied with the verdict. After all, the Babri Masjid stood at the disputed site in living memory and was violently brought down by kar sevaks backed by saffron parties – which the apex court emphatically recognised as a crime. Yet, the verdict essentially left the saffron parties with what they wanted.   
It is time, therefore, for RSS and BJP to do their bit to arrive at closure – they must be magnanimous and reach out to the Muslim side. This would also be in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. The Centre as well as UP government should be proactive, giving Muslims several options on the five acres of land to build a mosque, consulting them on what help they might need for this. They could even help fund construction of the mosque, paving the way for communal harmony across the country and immeasurably strengthening India. Ayodhya now calls for a political resolution, not judicial review.

     Basically, the editorial is suggesting starting a new round of Muslim appeasement. It is Muslim appeasement that led to the Ram Janmabhumi case run for so long and cause all the blood-shed. Without the appeasement politics, it could have been resolved in 1949. Why can't we be all equal and fair to each other? Why is it that the Muslim community always made to appear to be hurt by the news media and pseudo-intellectuals? If at all, the Muslim community should make all the efforts to help the Kashmiri Pandits thrown out of their homes by the Muslim majority in J&K. Whose feelings were hurt then and who went through the miseries? Everyone is so concerned about a mosque built on the ruins of a temple by a barbaric ISIS-like ruler and not about the lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits? Secularism?...

90,1617655368-264,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Ayodhya dispute – Is mediation the answer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/blunt-frank/ayodhya-dispute-is-mediation-the-answer/,Ayodhya dispute – Is mediation the answer?,"March 9, 2019, 3:42 PM  IST","There have been a lot of responses on the order passed by the honourable Supreme Court (SC) of India to try and resolve the Ayodhya dispute through mediation between. Unfortunately, most of the responses have come from the gallery while the litigants have hardly questioned the order. The gallery consists of politicians, religious bigots, communalists and the dangerous communal politicians. Politicians are using this to further their political ambitions and garner votes in the coming elections. Religious bigots and communalists are banking on faith and the faithful to see them through in their struggle without worrying for what may happen afterwards. Communal politicians not only have political interests at stake but are also seized with keeping communal passions burning with the dual aim of strengthening hold on their communities and ensuring vote banks. The gallery is indeed treading a very dangerous path that does not bode well for the nation. Unfortunately the media revels in bring these very people on prime time television to create controversies that are good for their TRPs.
There are many reasons that go in favour of a mediated settlement. But first it may be prudent to understand the implications of a legal settlement as opposed to the mediation route. Any judgement in favour of Hindus may open a Pandora’s Box. It is common knowledge that during Mughal times a lot of Hindu places of worship were destroyed and Muslim places of worships built on same sites. Ayodhya by virtue of its importance in Hindu mythology and religion is just one of those sites that stands out for obvious reasons. Will a judgement in favour of Hindus set a precedence for seeking similar judgement on other disputed sites? Knowing our nation and the way our society works, litigations will not be restricted to only genuine sites where Hindu places of worships were destroyed but many fraudulent claims too would come up for hearing. The outcomes of such a movement are there for all to see. The courts may have their hands tied since a precedence would have been set in Ayodhya. Muslims will feel victimised, communal riots will spread across the nation, Hindu Muslim divide will increase manifold. Governments in states and centre will be hard pressed to maintain law and order. Will Hindus like to count their gains at the cost of taking the nation to such a situation? The Muslims will not only lose Ayodhya but possibly many other sites too.
Now flip the coin to see what will happen in case the court decides in favour of Muslims in Ayodhya. Without a doubt in a short time a huge Muslim place of worship will come up at the disputed site. This will happen not because of any genuine religious commitment or belief but more because of the need to prove a point. Like it or not, it will become an eyesore for many Hindus who will feel they have been short changed. Given the fact that Ayodhya as a place holds no importance in Muslim history or religion, it is likely that it may not attract many faithful barring a few inquisitive kind. The small town of Ayodhya already has over thirty five mosques. Currently many among these are just structures where neither any prayers are carried out nor any visitors seen. So will the disputed site only add to the count and make it thirty six? If, on the other hand, just out of sheer curiosity the new Mosque starts attracting hordes of Muslim visitors then Ayodhya may become more of a Muslim pilgrimage town than for Hindus. Will this be acceptable to Hindus whose connections with Ayodhya date back to more than 6000 years ago? The answer is obvious and its implications even more obvious. In the final analysis nobody would have really gained from any of the two scenarios.
In the legal battle there is another twist too. Basically the disputed site is only 0.313 acres (some believe it is 2.77 acres that includes some land around the structure) out of a total of 67.703 acres. The undisputed 67.39 Acres, acquired by the government in 1993 through an ordinance, in all fairness must be returned to rightful owners who in this case are Hindus. If the verdict for the small piece of disputed land goes in favour of Hindus then there will be no problem as the two can be combined for the proposed Ram Mandir. However, if the disputed land of 0.313 acres (or 2.77 acres)
is given to Muslims, Hindus will never give the balance to them. This scenario will be a perfect recipe for a perpetual conflict at the site. If Hindus win and get the disputed land, once again the debate will be about suppression of minorities and how the nation is becoming a majoritarian state. In case the verdict goes in favour of Muslims the majority will feel they have no say in the country since minority appeasement is the rule of the land. Thus a legal verdict, despite some vague assurances of acceptance from either side, will spell doom whichever way it comes.
This is where the mediation route becomes a more viable option. If a decision is arrived through mediation then chances of further stress are minimal. There will be some disgruntled voices but then in a diverse nation of 1,250 million that cannot be ruled out. However, it will ensure that charges of majoritarian or minority appeasement will become untenable. A mediated decision will have to be based on the principle of give and take which will be good for communal harmony. Any decision by the courts will favour only one side, mediation enjoys the flexibility of arriving at a solution that will satisfy both sides. Ayodhya problem involves sentiments and faith and only mediation route can take these into account. Legal route does not enjoy that luxury. Needless to say that for mediation to work both sides will have to show maturity and understanding apart from ensuring that they do not fall prey to loose cannons from the gallery. If mediation succeeds the only losers will be those who constitute the gallery.
The SC has done well in choosing the mediation panel. Maverick and irrelevant communal politicians like Mr Owaisi of AIMIM while bickering about Sri Sri Ravi Shankar being on the panel deliberately chose not to highlight that the panel is led by a Muslim. There is no doubt that Sri Sri did say in one of his interviews last year that Muslims should give the site to Hindus as a goodwill gesture. This was stated in the context of avoiding communal riots and conflicts as seen in some other parts of the world. It is bizarre to find any problem with such a statement that has been echoed by many others too including some Muslims. It is also pertinent to note that there have been no reports of Hindus having any objection to Justice FMI Kalifulla’s nomination as head the panel. Mr Owaisi is a known Hindu baiter who has failed to spread his wings in Uttar Pradesh (UP) which is home to nearly forty million Muslims. He sees this as another opportunity and that is why all the noise. The media will do well to just ignore him. The court deserves to be lauded for its selection of panel members. The sceptics must note that decisions will not be taken by the panel since that right will lie only with the litigants. The panel will only guide and facilitate the discussions and perhaps put incongruous issues in their right perspective for litigants to take informed decisions jointly to come to an agreement.
Be it Hindus or Muslims, in India all come from the same stock and are part of a civilisation that is more than 6000 years old. Therefore both Hindus and Muslims in India have a common heritage. The question is can both rise to the occasion and arrive at a workable solution that bodes well for the nation that is looking to break the shackles of many other ills of past to embark on a journey of development and prosperity for all citizens?

     Mediation is always better than litigation. Mediation saves your cost, time and efforts.I believe that for every dispute, there can be a win-win resolution with no unnecessary expenditure, be it monetary or emotional.A mediator is a person who requires to exercise objectivity and self control. The whole process of dispute resolution revolves around independent, objective and unbiased approach which benefits all the parties involved in the dispute.I my self have experiecned mediation from TriMediate, they were really professional and that mediation was one of the best decisions in my life....

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",there have been a lot of responses on the order passed by the honourable supreme court sc of india to try and resolve the ayodhya dispute through mediation between unfortunately most of the responses have come from the gallery while the litigants have hardly questioned the order the gallery consists of politicians religious bigots communalists and the dangerous communal politicians politicians are using this to further their political ambitions and garner votes in the coming elections religious bigots and communalists are banking on faith and the faithful to see them through in their struggle without worrying for what may happen afterwards communal politicians not only have political interests at stake but are also seized with keeping communal passions burning with the dual aim of strengthening hold on their communities and ensuring vote banks the gallery is indeed treading a very dangerous path that does not bode well for the nation unfortunately the media revels in bring these very people on prime time television to create controversies that are good for their trpsthere are many reasons that go in favour of a mediated settlement but first it may be prudent to understand the implications of a legal settlement as opposed to the mediation route any judgement in favour of hindus may open a pandoras box it is common knowledge that during mughal times a lot of hindu places of worship were destroyed and muslim places of worships built on same sites ayodhya by virtue of its importance in hindu mythology and religion is just one of those sites that stands out for obvious reasons will a judgement in favour of hindus set a precedence for seeking similar judgement on other disputed sites knowing our nation and the way our society works litigations will not be restricted to only genuine sites where hindu places of worships were destroyed but many fraudulent claims too would come up for hearing the outcomes of such a movement are there for all to see the courts may have their hands tied since a precedence would have been set in ayodhya muslims will feel victimised communal riots will spread across the nation hindu muslim divide will increase manifold governments in states and centre will be hard pressed to maintain law and order will hindus like to count their gains at the cost of taking the nation to such a situation the muslims will not only lose ayodhya but possibly many other sites toonow flip the coin to see what will happen in case the court decides in favour of muslims in ayodhya without a doubt in a short time a huge muslim place of worship will come up at the disputed site this will happen not because of any genuine religious commitment or belief but more because of the need to prove a point like it or not it will become an eyesore for many hindus who will feel they have been short changed given the fact that ayodhya as a place holds no importance in muslim history or religion it is likely that it may not attract many faithful barring a few inquisitive kind the small town of ayodhya already has over thirty five mosques currently many among these are just structures where neither any prayers are carried out nor any visitors seen so will the disputed site only add to the count and make it thirty six if on the other hand just out of sheer curiosity the new mosque starts attracting hordes of muslim visitors then ayodhya may become more of a muslim pilgrimage town than for hindus will this be acceptable to hindus whose connections with ayodhya date back to more than 6000 years ago the answer is obvious and its implications even more obvious in the final analysis nobody would have really gained from any of the two scenariosin the legal battle there is another twist too basically the disputed site is only 0313 acres some believe it is 277 acres that includes some land around the structure out of a total of 67703 acres the undisputed 6739 acres acquired by the government in 1993 through an ordinance in all fairness must be returned to rightful owners who in this case are hindus if the verdict for the small piece of disputed land goes in favour of hindus then there will be no problem as the two can be combined for the proposed ram mandir however if the disputed land of 0313 acres or 277 acresis given to muslims hindus will never give the balance to them this scenario will be a perfect recipe for a perpetual conflict at the site if hindus win and get the disputed land once again the debate will be about suppression of minorities and how the nation is becoming a majoritarian state in case the verdict goes in favour of muslims the majority will feel they have no say in the country since minority appeasement is the rule of the land thus a legal verdict despite some vague assurances of acceptance from either side will spell doom whichever way it comesthis is where the mediation route becomes a more viable option

In 2011 the Supreme Court stayed this verdict. Tomorrow the Supreme Court is set to begin hearing the case again, with 16 appeals and petitions by Hindu and Muslim parties challenging the 2010 verdict.

The politically sensitive case continues its tryst with controversy. The latest one is caused by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi deciding to put it before a five-judge Constitution bench, even though as recently as in September a three-judge bench had turned down this demand.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-114772"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SC-1.png"" alt="""" width=""650"" height=""336"" srcset=""https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SC-1.png 650w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SC-1-300x155.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"">

The demand was made by Muslim parties on the ground that the Ayodhya dispute is a nationally important one. As this is a fair argument, the decision to have a larger bench to hear the case is a good one. It will comprise the CJI and four judges who are next in line to be CJIs. And SC rules do empower the CJI to exercise his discretion in assigning a matter to a larger bench depending on the importance of the issue involved.

Now the SC must keep the resolve to treat the masjid-mandir dispute as a civil land suit while both the Centre and UP government must let the SC decision set the matter at rest. This is a critical test of the country’s constitutional values.

92,1617655408-272,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,“The Ayodhya Judgment: The end of an era”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/straight-candid/the-ayodhya-judgment-the-end-of-an-era/,“The Ayodhya Judgment: The end of an era”,"November 13, 2019, 2:51 PM  IST","To analyse, much less criticise, a 1045 pages and 805 para Supreme Court judgment before the ink is dry is neither possible nor apposite. While a comprehensive critique must await fuller study, a few legal, political, and general points are nevertheless in order.
Firstly, we tend to underestimate, even ignore the remarkable achievement of a unanimous constitution bench judgment on a highly fractious and divisive issue, riven by law, factual controversies, emotive issues, archeological evidence, and historical treaties. Far lesser issues have frequently led to four-one or three-two verdicts. The court must be publically applauded for this united and unanimous approach which sends out its own clear and significant message to all the segments of Indian society. It also enhances the strength and weight of the judgment considerably.
Secondly, as I have repeatedly said in public over the last few months, the only correct, efficacious, and lasting solution to this highly divisive issue could be the binding judgment of the apex court. Neither the best intention mediation, nor a bonafide government, nor a responsible opposition, even if they existed and tried their best could achieve the motive and finality which a reasoned apex court judgment alone can achieve. I am therefore happy that further delays and attempts at any mediatory process were obviated and the court sat amidst considerable pressure over a Herculean 40 judicial days to deliver the verdict.
Thirdly, it is neither the job of an apex court nor humanly possible in any system to satisfy every litigant or every stakeholder. To be human is to be fallible. And more than anyone else, the Supreme court has said to in innumerable judgments. All agree that the Supreme court is right because it is final and not final because it is right. But that can and should never be a ground for uninformed criticism.
Fourthly, as aptly put by a political party, why the judgment has opened the doors for the swift construction of a grand temple (and a much larger space elsewhere in the same city for a grand mosque). It has also rightly closed the doors to constant politicisation of this issue, to its exploitation for cheap sensationalism or petty political gains, and for flogging a festering soar. Periodically, to extract unnecessary mileage for ulterior motives. Thus, the very desirable opening of doors has led to the equally commending closing of other doors.
Fifthly, a bare look at the text of the long judgment shows that the court has laboured long and hard and most of its findings are unexceptionable. It has held the Akhada’s suite barred by limitations, as the dates and events clearly show that this, while holding proceedings by others (including the Sunni board) to be within limitation. It has rightly held that while the deity has an independent right to suite, a mere Poojari can not be equated with a Shebait, because the latter is supposed to be an agent of the idol and trusted with the idol’s property to manage, which has not been shown by any evidence. Equally, it has rightly rejected the non-maintainability of the later suites, noting that the earlier 1885 suite was for distinct prayers relating merely to the Ram Chabutara and filed by different parties (pr. 446). Similarly, it held the Sunni suite to be maintainable (pr 627).
Sixthly, in important findings from paras 795 to 801, the court has reasonably held, after analysing humongous evidence that the Hindus have continuously used the outer courtyard from inception; that the Hindus have even used the inner courtyard from well before 1857; that though the Muslims also intermittently offered prayers in the inner courtyard area from 1600 to 1949, they were unable to establish the exclusive possession of the inner courtyard; that, however, there longstanding practice of Namaz in the inner courtyard was unlawfully stopped in 1949 and consequently, and significantly, while they had failed to prove exclusive possessory rights, their longstanding although irregular practice of Namaz and their unlawful ouster in 1949, justified the invocation of special apex court powers under article 142 to award restitution and direct the availability of a five-acre alternative site in Ayodhya for the construction of a new mosque.
Seventhly, from paras 508 to 512, the court analysed in great details the ASI report which gave clear factual findings on the pre-existence of a big structure beneath the demolished structure; the fact that that earlier structure was non-Islamic; that it had several motives and features which related to Hindu culture and religion and upheld the conclusion of Justice Sudhir Agarwal of the Hight Court that the ASI’s omission to give one crucial finding (namely whether the earlier structure was a temple or not) would not change anything.
Several other paras discuss the question of faith and belief which undeniably establishes the fact that the Hindus consider this spot as the birthplace of Lord Ram. Though the relief is clearly not founded upon faith and belief.
None of the above reasonings or findings can be said perverse, unknown to law or dehors establish legal principles of judicial adjudication. In an entirely possible for legal practitioners, scholars, and citizens alike to quibble all legal niceties and political rhetoric (indeed, democracy would be in danger if this cacophony was absent). But it would be unwise, hasty, knee-jerk and irresponsible to launch broadsides of uninformed criticism against this comprehensive judgment.

With its track record of governance not giving the party much traction, victories have been coming the BJP’s way rather too easily. There is now unanimity that the Congress is a long shot for 2009.   That the Congress needs a credible makeover is being conceded by even its die-hard admirers. With terrorism emerging as the driving issue for the next election, no one is betting on the Congress’ ability suddenly change track, and credibly so. The Lok Sabha elections are less than a year away and the Congress will be at the starting block with the near-debilitating handicap on the issue of terrorism.   The Congress has only itself to blame as it has been allowing liberals to guide its thought process on the issue. When this section choreographed a series of protests for appeasing the “easily outraged” in the past four years, the government willingly went along with their views.   Demands for stiff anti-terror laws were seen as politically incorrect arrogance; calls for stringent vigil against saboteurs were dubbed expressions of paranoia; and voices against appeasement were seen as bigotry. The result — handcuffed law-enforcers tackling terror leading to destruction all around. And what is missing is a resolve to grab the reins back from the unhinged liberals.   That the Congress cannot guide the nation through these perilous times is a fact that is being advertised at regular intervals by senior government leaders like Shivraj Patil. Even when innocent citizens were maimed and murdered in cold blood at Varanasi, Ayodhya, Hyderabad, Delhi, Jaipur and more recently in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, the man in charge of the country’s internal security did not have the courage to name the enemy who is driven by a hateful and life-devaluing ideology. Given this context, it is only natural that the electorate is basing its voting reflexes in states on the repeated behaviour of those who man the internal security apparatus.   The government can no longer treat the Opposition’s attack on the government over terrorism as a partisan and rhetorical battle. That the Congress and the government are going to have harder time avoiding the fact is evident from a perusal of the mountain of evidence on the changing complexion of the terror activity. For the past few years, intelligence reports have been talking about terror going “local”.

94,1617655023-180,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Faith alone?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/not-categorized/faith-alone/,Faith alone?,"October 1, 2010, 8:09 PM  IST","When the Ayodhya moment finally came on Thursday afternoon after decades of intense suspense, it was one of great relief, burying a bitter and raucous chapter, and it was also time to move on. This well-accepted view is both rosy and practical; this should be layered with abundant caution.
The Allahabad High Court opted to come out with a judgment trifurcating the disputed 2.7-acre land based primarily on faith and belief. The court no doubt honoured the niceties of jurisprudence, but did it at some point — wittingly or otherwise — shake the very bedrock of legal course by putting faith above law? To its credit, the court deeply studied an amazing array of treatises, including Atharva Veda, Skanda Purana, Narsingh Purana, Valmiki Ramayana, Ramcharit Manasa, Kone Upnishad, Babarnama, Humayunnama, Tareekh-e-Badauni, Tareekh-e-Farishta, Aaina-e-Akbari and Tareekh-e-Shahi. Somewhere deep down, the court also took note of the widely held belief about Lord Ram’s birthplace, which could not be scientifically established though there were ample suggestions to that effect, and decided to endorse it as such. Thus, the central-dome area of the disputed structure has been apportioned to the Hindu group and the rest to Sunni Waqf Board and Nirmohi Akhara in a one-land-to-all-three judgment.
That the court verdict was received with restraint from both sides of the divide is a matter of consolation, not congratulatory unless one is naive that hawks turned doves in the bat of an eyelid. The question that springs to the fore is: will disputes on matters of faith — there are many Babri-like disputes pending in court where the title can’t be established without reasonable doubt — cite the Babri judgment template and put faith above everything else? Are we uncorking many — and, mostly, unknown –jars in hope of capping a messy one? Is it the statute of limitations? Are we setting a precedent that’s none too pleasing for the greater good? For argument’s sake, how will one measure the faith of one religion against that of the other? Which brings us to the question `is faith measurable at all’, and what about cases where two religious groups are laying claim to a particular piece of land? In the Babri dispute, the question was rather easy: a standing mosque versus a place where Ram was believed to have been born.
The court, much as it is applauded for seemingly paving the way for an amicable solution, may have also opened the door a crack to other claims on shrines and religious structures. Are we shifting the goalposts and fighting the battle on new turf? The issue merits closer examination.
Strictly in legal terms, hope the Babri verdict applause is momentary. Sound legal principles – no matter how dire the case is – should remain the core of any verdict. Hope the Supreme Court will fill in the gaps.

     Before the judgement all the politicians, media were saying: We should all abide by the judgement of the court; We should not take law in our hands; We should not inflame the passions etc. Now after the judgement, they are the ones who are instigating muslims that courts have not given judgemnet based on law but on faith. So if the judgement was  only in favour of muslims, it would have been based on law. Then what was the need to go to court. Is it not contemept of court to openly declare in public and media that judgement is not correct? I sincerely hope that media and politicians show maturity and maintain the calm that the general public has shown....  Read More

The verdict says less about the law and more about our country which is remarkable for the extraordinary continuity of its traditions rather than their antiquity. We live at the same time in the first, the eleventh and the twenty-first centuries, and the court’s judgment has upheld this continuity and simultaneity of our historical lives. The verdict has ensured communal harmony but do we have reasons to worry that it might encourage demolition of other mosques on sites where there were pre-existing temples?

Nothing is quite perfect in the world and certainly not human beings. Well-meaning legal and secular fundamentalists, who have criticised this judgment, seek moral perfection in a pragmatic nation. Both Hindus and Muslims worshipped inside the 2.77 acre compound of the Babri Masjid–at least since the 19th century. This peaceful practice was disrupted in 1949 when someone placed idols of Ram inside the mosque as a political act. The judgment of the High Court has restored the plural situation which existed before this political act. Court verdicts are inevitably political but the best ones have kept us united and democratic. This verdict is a good example of prudence, the chief virtue of rulers according to Edmund Burke, because prudence eschews perfection.

Whether Ram was born in a particular spot is of little significance to me and given a choice I would have built a park on this disputed property. However, I respect the deep meaning it holds for others. The High Court judges have also shown consideration for this ideal of public dharma, which in fact gave birth to the Indian republic. India’s founding fathers came to this ideal from different inspirations–Gandhi from the Gita; Nehru from the deeds of Emperor Asoka, and Ambedkar from the Buddha. Such was the importance of this ideal that they placed it at the centre of the Indian flag as dharmachakra, the wheel of dharma. India cannot be understood without dharma, just as France cannot be comprehended without ""égalité"" nor America without ""liberty"".

The good Vidura says in the Mahabharata that in judging a ruler’s actions he looks to the results. If it benefits the people, it is an act of dharma; if it harms them then it is adharma. This is also the spirit behind the pragmatic verdict of the High Court. Unlike Yudhishthira, Vidura would agree to ‘sacrifice an individual for the sake of a village and a village for the sake of a nation’. Vidura is half brother and royal counsellor to the king of Hastinapur and he speaks from the experience of managing a state. In agreeing to sacrifice a person in order to save many, he has drawn a distinction between public and private dharma. The English thinker, Jeremy Bentham, went on to make this criterion famous in the 19th century via his Utilitarian slogan-‘the greatest good of the greatest number’.

Conquerors have come and gone in all countries. Each conqueror razed old monuments to build new ones. Christian shrines came up on pagan temples of Rome and Greece. Muslim conquerors built mosques on Hindu temples just as Hindus and Buddhist fought over their sacred spaces. It is the way of the world. We not unique and we should be relaxed about our history. Since some people are not, this historic judgment has prudently revisited history in order to close it without opening new wounds. It acknowledges the birthplace of Ram without holding anyone responsible for the destruction of a temple or a mosque.

The reaction of people has been mature, which is not surprising at a time of galloping economic growth and rapid change in our society. Indians have moved on–we are not less religious, but we care about other things now and have less appetite for the politics of religion. We are more self-confident and optimistic. For these reasons this verdict will not encourage demolition of other mosques, as some believe. The young, especially, have moved away from the politics of Ayodhya, which is a cautionary warning to the BJP about Hindutva’s relevance. It too should move on to more relevant concerns such as governance. There are more votes in promising judicial, administrative, and police reforms.

This is an important judgment for modern India and the people have responded in a mature and wise manner. By appealing to the subtle, pragmatic, and ancient art of dharma, it is a very Indian verdict. Those who have criticised it seek rational solutions when the vast majority of Indians are driven by belief. The High Court has wisely reclaimed the ancient ideal of public dharma, which is happily the proud foundation stone of our Republic.

96,1617655008-176,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Abdicating India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/indus-calling/abdicating-india/,Abdicating India,"July 25, 2010, 10:12 PM  IST","On Kargil Victory Day (July 26), the UPA government has gifted the Indian forces a bizarre decision: scrapping the purchase of artillery guns, which the Army has been demanding urgently. As a defence report says, artillery guns ran havoc on the enemy during Operation Vijay in the Kargil war. These guns are extremely necessary for mountain conflicts. It is predicted that there is 80% probability that the next war India will fight will be in mountains. Nobody answers why we have not bought any artillery guns for long. Whatever we are left with are in bad condition. This news shows the lacklustre attitude of the UPA regime. For the fifth time in the last eight years such a process has been stalled.
The second major fiasco has happened on the external affairs front.
Even in the worse days of the Gujral doctrine, Indian interests were never abdicated the way this government with a CBI mascot has done. The Indian foreign minister not only swallowed the bitter pill of humiliation on a land hostile to us, yielding to an arrogantly unmannered Qureshi, he committed a diplomatic sin against his own country by criticizing his home secretary, synchronizing his fool mouth with Qureshi’s foul one on Pillai. What a Track 2, friendly diplomacy at zero level by state players.
Even if Pillai was wrong and the content and the timing of what he said was not music to Krishna, the faceless minister for foreign affairs did a great disservice to Indian interests and honour by publicly lampooning his own government’s secretary and choosing to walk with a Qureshi, who is not even a Congress voter. It seems the Congress has waged a war on the home ministry. First, the minister was targeted by none other than the centre of all decisions — Sonia Gandhi. She was religiously followed by the beguilers Digvijay and Mani. Poor Chidambaram couldn’t even expect help, or even feeble support, from his constitutional boss, Man Mohan Singh. And a failed leader from Madhya Pradesh, seeking solace in the lap of Naxalites and jihadis through ill-timed pilgrimages to their homes sought to get a few headlines by certifying Chidambaram left-handedly through ‘arranged’ interviews on news channels and in the print media. The government and the party are managed through the media a la Rakhi Sawant’s Swayamvar. ""I won’t speak anything till the media is present.""
When the mechanic loses the will to repair the car, he fights with his tools to harass the complaining clients. The people, in this case are the receivers of a failed government’s irritation, born out of self-realized incompetence. The governors intimidate an opposition through the most-abused tool of CBI in preparation of elections and then ask its leaders to enjoy lunch with them! They say no one should use the term Islamic while reporting terrorism and then make sure that a new term Hindu terror is widely circulated on the basis of a few unbaked ‘homemade’ servings of politicized Intelligence agencies. Their CBI lets off Mr Honey “Q” of an Italian clan and unfreezes his London accounts while a blue-eyed boy of 10 Janpath is let off by the same agency which is now sarcastically believed to have shifted it headquarters to Congress party’s tool room, earning its daily bread by exonerating Jagdish Tytlers from having any ‘hand’ in the massacre of 3,000 Sikhs. The same clan gives Bharat Ratna to a person who had justified the killings by an infamous line ""when the big tree falls earth shakes"", and refuses honours to Savarkar and Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who lived and died for the unity of the nation. Yet, they say, they believe in democracy.
They have no qualms in inviting the divisive Muslim League to join the Cabinet and talking affectionately to the traitors and offering olive branches of love and ‘understanding’ to Naxalites. But have you ever heard a Hindu leader was ever invited by the PM on lunch for exchanging notes on what’s happening in the nation? It’s the most revengeful governance horrendously practising ideological apartheid against a particular section of believers who happen to be Indians and patriotic. They are harassed, condemned and sought to be banished just because they demand Kashmiri Hindus’ return with safety and honour, and a temple where Ram was born. They get delisted for saying no to the destruction of a bridge that was built by Ram. These saffrons are not Nehrus and believe that even a boy who was pasting posters of the party in his young days can become party president and you don’t have to be essentially born in a family to dream high. They oppose tooth and nail any theocracy — no Hindu state and no special privileges to any one on the basis of religion and want a united India.
But they are projected as the biggest threat to Muslims who have fared worst in any secular regime from West Bengal to UP and Kashmir to Kerala. From Day 1, when we got a truncated independence, the Nehrus were always inlvolved in unsavoury deals. First we saw the Jeep scandal involving Nehru’s blue-eyed boy Krishna Menon, while jawans were fighting a battle in Kashmir. Followed by Mundhra and Nagarwala cases. India lost 1.25 lakh sq km of land to China and Pakistan after 1947 and under a Congress regime suffered 1962’s humiliation due to ignoring defence preparedness.  We lost Haji Peer in spite of the 1965 win and left Kashmir unresolved at Simla after 1971’s great victory. The Congress rate of own-goals was furthered by assaults on Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha’s verdict, Emergency, Blue Star, faux pas of IPKF in Sri Lanka, Bofors deal, Submarine purchase scandal and kowtowing to Washington’s pressures.
Poverty and rural unemployment has increased abysmally in Congress regimes forcing thousands of farmers to commit suicide while 40% of India lives on a mere Rs 20 a day earning. The footpath people, who are born, live and die on the pavements of the metros have got no solace while the multistorey buildings of the rich get even higher. This government has proved that the Nehruvian doctrine of the elite has only fattened the rich and robed the emasculated masses.  And the world’s most atrocious exile of an entire community too occurred in Kashmir under the dispensation of the Congress,  whose flagship is marked with a soft attitude on Afzal and affectionatly mourning LeT’s Ishrat Jahan.
The most scandalous incident of ignoring the nation’s defence needs relates to the inability of the Congress/UPA regime to purchase urgently needed military hardware for the forces.
A kiddish media fed on government largesse and ready to be used for revenge killings becomes a tool of the secular machinations to mount assault on the Hindus on the dotted pattern of the Stalinist Soviet Russia. They forget tarnishing Hindu name tarnishes India too. They forget that Hindus have never ever supported any extremism in their age-old lifespan. Pluralism and a warm appreciation of a different viewpoint are intrinsically woven into the Hindu fabric, which has given shelter to the persecuted communities of the world and the uniqueness is expressed through Dargah worship to the Indian Islam, a trait which is strictly forbidden in the Wahhabi lands. They appropriated Gandhi murdering his legacy of tolerance and an indigenous pattern of development seeking to eliminate the fact that Gandhi represents not only the best in India but the best in Hindu Dharma. They never gave anything substantial to Muslims and the worst-ever riots since 1947 against Sikhs and Muslims occurred during Congress regimes, read the home ministry’s reports. It was the Congress that showed all the love for the world’s biggest perpetrators of mass murderers who unleashed dictatorial terror regimes like Stalin and Mao, inviting their Indian followers to share governance and copied the hateful Godse to suffocate Gandhi’s legacy in governance and organization by supporting family rule and intimidating everything that represented the Indian ethos, from Ayodhya to Sharda in POK, yet claim to be ‘tolerant, objective and cultured’ politicians.
They support the separatists in Kashmir, help them gain weight and provide medical help and logistics to them, yet want Kashmir to remain in India. They wish the world would recognize the fact that Kashmir is India but we fail to emphasize the unanimous resolution of Parliament that pledged to regain the land Pakistan and China grabbed illegally.
Governance was never at such low ebb. And at its riotous best. Keep your fingers crossed as it can go to any length in ts hunger to harvest elections in Bihar and UP.
The only loser would be the idea of India.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",on kargil victory day july 26 the upa government has gifted the indian forces a bizarre decision scrapping the purchase of artillery guns which the army has been demanding urgently as a defence report says artillery guns ran havoc on the enemy during operation vijay in the kargil war these guns are extremely necessary for mountain conflicts it is predicted that there is 80 probability that the next war india will fight will be in mountains nobody answers why we have not bought any artillery guns for long whatever we are left with are in bad condition this news shows the lacklustre attitude of the upa regime for the fifth time in the last eight years such a process has been stalledthe second major fiasco has happened on the external affairs fronteven in the worse days of the gujral doctrine indian interests were never abdicated the way this government with a cbi mascot has done the indian foreign minister not only swallowed the bitter pill of humiliation on a land hostile to us yielding to an arrogantly unmannered qureshi he committed a diplomatic sin against his own country by criticizing his home secretary synchronizing his fool mouth with qureshis foul one on pillai what a track 2 friendly diplomacy at zero level by state playerseven if pillai was wrong and the content and the timing of what he said was not music to krishna the faceless minister for foreign affairs did a great disservice to indian interests and honour by publicly lampooning his own governments secretary and choosing to walk with a qureshi who is not even a congress voter it seems the congress has waged a war on the home ministry first the minister was targeted by none other than the centre of all decisions — sonia gandhi she was religiously followed by the beguilers digvijay and mani poor chidambaram couldnt even expect help or even feeble support from his constitutional boss man mohan singh and a failed leader from madhya pradesh seeking solace in the lap of naxalites and jihadis through illtimed pilgrimages to their homes sought to get a few headlines by certifying chidambaram lefthandedly through arranged interviews on news channels and in the print media the government and the party are managed through the media a la rakhi sawants swayamvar i wont speak anything till the media is presentwhen the mechanic loses the will to repair the car he fights with his tools to harass the complaining clients the people in this case are the receivers of a failed governments irritation born out of selfrealized incompetence the governors intimidate an opposition through the mostabused tool of cbi in preparation of elections and then ask its leaders to enjoy lunch with them they say no one should use the term islamic while reporting terrorism and then make sure that a new term hindu terror is widely circulated on the basis of a few unbaked homemade servings of politicized intelligence agencies their cbi lets off mr honey q of an italian clan and unfreezes his london accounts while a blueeyed boy of 10 janpath is let off by the same agency which is now sarcastically believed to have shifted it headquarters to congress partys tool room earning its daily bread by exonerating jagdish tytlers from having any hand in the massacre of 3000 sikhs the same clan gives bharat ratna to a person who had justified the killings by an infamous line when the big tree falls earth shakes and refuses honours to savarkar and syama prasad mookerjee who lived and died for the unity of the nation yet they say they believe in democracythey have no qualms in inviting the divisive muslim league to join the cabinet and talking affectionately to the traitors and offering olive branches of love and understanding to naxalites but have you ever heard a hindu leader was ever invited by the pm on lunch for exchanging notes on whats happening in the nation its the most revengeful governance horrendously practising ideological apartheid against a particular section of believers who happen to be indians and patriotic they are harassed condemned and sought to be banished just because they demand kashmiri hindus return with safety and honour and a temple where ram was born they get delisted for saying no to the destruction of a bridge that was built by ram these saffrons are not nehrus and believe that even a boy who was pasting posters of the party in his young days can become party president and you dont have to be essentially born in a family to dream high they oppose tooth and nail any theocracy — no hindu state and no special privileges to any one on the basis of religion and want a united indiabut they are projected as the biggest threat to muslims who have fared worst in

97,1617655335-255,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/2/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,‘Muslims not willing for an out-of-court settlement on Ayodhya … charges should not be dropped against Advani and Joshi’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/the-interviews-blog/muslims-not-willing-for-an-out-of-court-settlement-on-ayodhya-charges-should-not-be-dropped-against-advani-and-joshi/,‘Muslims not willing for an out-of-court settlement on Ayodhya … charges should not be dropped against Advani and Joshi’,"March 27, 2017, 3:45 PM  IST","After Chief Justice of India JS Khehar proposed an out-of-court mediation effort for the Ram temple dispute, Zafaryab Jilani, convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC), spoke with Rohit E David on why he thinks mediation will not work, why a speedy court verdict is needed and charges against LK Advani and MM Joshi in the temple demolition case:
Why are you opposed to the CJI’s proposal for an out-of-court settlement?
This is an observation made by the Supreme Court. This was made following the statements of Subramanian Swamy. He is not a party in any of the cases so the court told him to go and settle the matter outside the court. Earlier also, out-of-court settlement efforts have been made at the highest level and failed. The Muslims are not willing for an out-of-court settlement. None of the demands made by the other parties are acceptable by us.
Judicially speaking, what are the issues at stake here?
It is a case which originated in 1949 when idols were placed inside the mosque. The idols were put forcibly and an FIR was also lodged. A Hindu person had filed a civil suit seeking that the idols should not be removed. The court had granted that permission. This was the start of the court tussle. Nirmohi Akhara also filed a suit in 1959. This akhara is that body which has been doing puja on that platform in the outer portion of the mosque. Thereafter, Muslims also filed a case in 1961 that the surrounding area belonged to them. All these cases were kept together. In 1989, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) filed another suit. Allahabad high court passed an order in 1989 that all the suits in this matter be transferred to the high court. Meanwhile, the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. All the cases continued in the high court.
On September 30, 2010, a judgment was given by three judges of the Allahabad high court that the property be divided in three parts – one portion to be given to Muslims, one to Ram Lalla and one to Nirmohi Akhara. The judges further observed that a leading portion be given to Ram Lalla, since the deity stands there. Against this, cases are pending in the Supreme Court.
Why do you feel LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti should face criminal conspiracy charges?
They are already facing trial in one case. Crime 198 named LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and others for communal speeches before the demolition. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court. More than 50 witnesses have already been examined in this case. Crime 197 deals with actual demolition of the mosque by kar sevaks. In that case the CBI court in 2001 had observed that proceedings be dropped against them. The court said that the nature of allegations against them is the same as in crime 198. Against this CBI has filed an appeal in the high court.
After high court dismissed the appeal, CBI has gone to the Supreme Court. After formation of NDA government in 2014, we saw that CBI has been under the influence of central government and it may withdraw the appeal or get it dismissed. We have also filed a review petition. LK Advani, MM Joshi have been made accused by CBI and charges should not be dropped against them. They are liable to be prosecuted and punished.
Do you feel that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will pursue the Ayodhya case through Sunni Waqf Board?
Sunni Waqf Board is a corporate body created by an act of Parliament. It is not the department of the government. The state government is not directly in control of that body. Yogi cannot pursue this case because he is not an officer of this board.
Yogi has cleared 20 acres land for Ramayana museum in Ayodhya. Your views?
Yogi has not given this land. It was given by the earlier government. Yogi has nothing to do with it. There is no problem in having a museum. Museum already exists there for more than 20 years.
With Yogi’s anointment as UP CM, do you think it signals BJP’s return to a Hindutva strategy?  
BJP is a Hindutva party itself. There is nothing new. Yogi has been elected by BJP, nothing more.
Do you feel BJP is moving towards plans to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya?
Yes, it has been BJP’s agenda for so many years now. They had demolished the mosque for this purpose. No government can afford to violate the order of the Supreme Court. We have been demanding that proceedings be expedited.

In the ivory high-rise we live in, political activity is restricted to resident welfare associations (RWAs), and interactions with RSS swayamsevaks who come calling during elections to preach the virtues of voting, and how this strengthens the nation. Which is why it was surprising to hear slogans last week like ‘We want justice’ and ‘Azadi!’ from a lively bunch as they marched down the ‘road below’.
The protest was perplexing — especially considering Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) does not have a satellite campus. In recent years, public activism has become a strict no-no in most residential colonies, typifying urban India’s middle-class cocoons. Since most residents equate any form of protest with ‘anti-nationalism’, however, why did the rape and murder of the young veterinarian in Hyderabad incense people so much that they came out on the streets in protest — and later, to publicly rejoice the reported ‘encounter’ killings of the perpetrators?
Were these one-off demonstrations organised by conscientious citizens? Or were they indicative of subtle shift in people’s attitude to State power and the broadening of their concerns? Theorising on the basis of ‘anecdotal evidence’ is fraught with dangers. But there is certainly a need to examine the extent to which such protests can be linked to BJP’s recent political setbacks.
Arguably, below-par performance in Maharashtra, and being forced to accept a coalition partner primarily representing Jats in Haryana, indicates the political tide turning somewhat against the party. The subsequent political adventurism in Maharashtra, too, embarrassingly backfired.
These developments will influence Jharkhand’s ongoing polls, and will likely to also have a bearing on BJP’s fortunes in Delhi polls in February. It does not help that economic news everywhere has ‘distress’ as a common headline.
Although GoI has taken several measures to boost the economy, the old cheer is missing. Coming barely six months after registering a superlative electoral tally, and also keeping the nationalistic narrative up and running by suspending Article 370 on J&K and having the Ayodhya verdict ‘go its way’, there are sufficient reasons for BJP to worry.
This, however, is not the first time BJP is confronted with a challenge while in office at the Centre. In 2015, when still politically ascendant, the party suffered humiliating defeats in Delhi and Bihar.
These losses coincided with sections of the intelligentsia rediscovering their voice and protesting against alleged ‘minority profiling’ and targeted attacks. Yet, BJP steadied its ship, pursued policies of its choice, secured greater ideological support, and won state elections.
The party again went through a slump from the autumn of 2017. The ‘barely respectable’ performance in Gujarat, followed by several defeats in bypolls, and being voted out of power in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, boxed BJP in an unenviable position.
When asked about the party’s ‘nightmare situation’, a senior party leader responded by saying that Lok Sabha polls were being reduced to an ‘aggregate of 543 elections’. Opinion polls suggested India was, indeed, moving towards that scenario, as economic woes mounted and people began to look at their bottom line, rather than towards matters of national ‘pride’ and security.
Eventually, the terrorist strike in Pulwama in February 2019, GoI’s retaliation in Balakot, and the swift return of captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman enabled Modi to personally script a high-decibel campaign based on national security and pride. It bore dividends, the extent of which few anticipated. Sensing an ideological tilt in its favour, BJP pressed on core items in its Hindutva agenda.
By the time elections were called in Maharashtra and Haryana, most Indians had turned fatalistic. The PM downward, many prominent BJP leaders cited decisions on Kashmir and the criminalisation of instant triple talaq, among other issues, to showcase the party’s commitment to a certain form of nationalism.
Yet, as bypolls in West Bengal also revealed, there are limits to ideology driving state elections, not to mention support to some of BJP’s ideological pursuits.
Witness, for instance, state leaders asserting that Trinamool Congress gains in all three seats were due to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) going on an overdrive. Furthermore, voters in Maharashtra and Haryana were guided more by local concerns and less by national ‘achievements’ that BJP had listed.
Prior to polling in the two western states, many concluded that BJP merely needed to spin one ‘Hindutva narrative’ after another to keep winning elections. Recent developments, however, require BJP to assess if the law of diminishing returns applies to ideological accomplishments, too. Additionally, if after ‘settling’ matters pertaining to inter-community relations, are people beginning to be guided more by livelihood and other concerns? Does Shiv Sena remaining devoted to Hindutva — as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced after breaking with BJP and forming government in Maharashtra — neutralise Modi’s advantage?
Do the street protests mirror an emerging reality? There are no immediate answers. But recent developments will force soul-searching in every party, including BJP.

That even RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat turned up in solidarity reveals why the optics of the event was important. The central legislation demanded by VHP and Shiv Sena is unlikely before Supreme Court can deliver its judgment. BJP’s top leaders, in contrast, are demanding that SC hear the case from January and not delay it any longer.
The return of the Ram Mandir to Indian political centrestage has seen interesting turns in the past one year. There are both political and judicial dimensions to how this came about. The exit of Pravin Togadia from VHP and the threat by his newly formed AHP to build an event more militant organisation and renew the Ayodhya struggle has forced VHP to respond strongly. Shiv Sena, forever looking to gain an edge over BJP, appears more intent on asking why BJP has so far failed to build the mandir by marching into Ayodhya.

After several chief justices who shied away from taking it up, Justice Dipak Misra picked up the gauntlet. The 2-1 verdict rejecting the demand to send the 1994 Ismail Faruqui judgment to a larger constitutional bench saw a strong dissent by Justice Abdul Nazeer. The 1994 3-2 Faruqui verdict which noted that mosques are not essential to the practice of Islam is severely problematic.
The dissent of two minority judges on that bench who slammed the Centre for failing to uphold public order and stopping the mob from demolishing Babri Masjid and then deciding to acquire the land on grounds of upholding public order has many votaries. Justice Gogoi may still choose to revisit Faruqui by constituting a bench larger than the one by Misra which said no to reviewing it.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to reveal his mind on Ayodhya unlike his deputy Amit Shah. PM Modi would certainly be weighing the pros and cons of throwing his weight behind the movement. Going by election reports from pollbound states all the rhetoric on Ayodhya has hardly made an impact anywhere, not even in a Hindutva laboratory like Madhya Pradesh. Even in UP, the Mandir hasn’t really worked for BJP since 1999.
With many Congress leaders also not appearing averse to a Mandir a compromise must be worked out by the PM if he has to intervene. I would plumb for a replica of the Babri Masjid at the exact site of the demolished mosque, and a grand Ram mandir and a national harmony monument beside it. Let’s put the ghosts to rest.

But, the citizens of the country should never be the victims of this war.
Donald Trump, President of the United States recently suggested that the government shutdown could last for ‘months or even years.’
Trump wants to build the wall in order to control illegal immigrants from crossing the US-Mexico borders.
Democrats have made clear by their no-negotiating attitude with President Trump over border protection that they don’t want a fence or a wall mounted. Donald Trump, in order to achieve his election agenda, directed a partial shutdown. This was done in order to teach Democrats a lesson.
Trump has dropped the US delegation to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, as the country continues suspended by the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States.
India, on the other hand, faced a similar scenario. The Narendra Modi lead central government wants to build Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
Judicial delays and cunning lawyers in the opposition delayed the verdict.
The government faced heat from their vote bank and even lost three state elections, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan, which had a Hindu majority.
But, the difference between Trump and Modi became evident.
Trump, due to opposition’s unwillingness to fund the wall, couldn’t keep up to his promise yet. Rather than focusing on other agendas of his government, he went for a total shut down. This hampered the economy of the United States.
Correctional officers, US Marshals, FBI agents, TSA employees, Coast Guard employees, Border Patrol officers, Forest Service firefighters and Weather Service forecasters are all required to work without pay.
Narendra Modi, on the other hand, moved his focus on other plans of his government. He passed a much-needed bill to provide reservation and support to the general category poor population in India.
The general category covers everyone including the reserved one such as SC, ST. This is a revolutionary step as it maintains the Pro-Poor, Pro-Development plan of his government.
Aayushman Bharat, or Modicare, ensures free healthcare for everyone in need. I believe this unprecedented step by Modi government would not only secure 2019 elections for him, but it would also benefit every single Indian who cannot afford medical treatment. The results on the ground are awe-inspiring, and the Modi wave is back in India.
Trump contested the election on a single agenda, and so the entire United States is kept on suspension whereas Narendra Modi fought on multiple agendas, and so the country is prospering towards a superpower through a stable, visionary government.
Therefore, I think, Donald Trump would certainly find a good inspiration in Narendra Modi when it comes to governing a country even if the opposition is unsupportive and/or poisonous.

101,1617655169-214,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"Liberalism is alive, but what about ‘liberal’ parties?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/liberalism-is-alive-but-what-about-liberal-parties/,"Liberalism is alive, but what about ‘liberal’ parties?","February 20, 2020, 2:08 PM  IST","In August 2017, I travelled to Kerala to shoot a special feature for Times Now on the series of political killings of RSS and Left workers, a bloody ongoing rivalry that dates back to the 1960s. The epicenter of this blood-feud is the district of Kannur, and a visit to the Communist Pary of India (Marxist) headquarters there provided a telling indication of the crisis of credibility that afflicts one of the self-proclaimed representatives of political liberalism in India. The four walls of the building’s central hall are adorned with photographs of the party’s ‘martyrs’ through the years, who’ve fallen at the hands of ideological and political rivals in a state where party or organizational affiliation worn as a badge of honour could also earn a place on an opponent’s hit-list. But right above these photographs hung massive portraits of Communism’s biggest icons, also some of the world’s most ruthless tyrants. If Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong who murdered millions, eliminated rivals, and crushed dissent continue to inspire its cadres today, surely the moral high ground the Left likes to claim over a ‘fascist-inspired Hindutva’ propagated by the RSS and the BJP falls flat?
The ideological turf wars that the Left has waged against its opponents in Kerala and West Bengal, and the consequent retaliation, have claimed hundreds of lives through the decades. And yet, India’s over-ground Communist parties are bracketed with the thoughts and ideas that social liberalism is meant to stand for: defending the right to free speech and expression, respect for religious and intellectual diversity, promoting inclusivity and accommodation, upholding one’s fundamental rights and holding institutions accountable. But it’s not just the Left that is undeserving of this association with liberalism. If the BJP, in the Opposition’s eyes, is the anti-thesis of liberalism, the reality of India is that there’s no other party worth its weight that can claim to truly represent itself as a liberal alternative.
One need not even go as far back as the Emergency or the anti-Sikh massacre to expose the Congress party’s double-speak on liberalism. Several of the so-called ‘urban naxals’, such as Vernon Gonsalves and Sudhir Dhawale, whose arrests it now condemns as an act of muzzling dissent had brushes with the law and were jailed during the UPA tenure. The party’s religious appeasement involved calls to fast-track terror cases where ‘innocent’ Muslims had been arrested, but it was the Maharashtra ATS reporting to a Congress-NCP government that jailed 10 Muslims for the 2006 Malegaon blasts. A decade later, they were acquitted with a large chunk of their life taken away from them, after the NIA under the UPA pursued a ‘saffron-terror’ angle, which too would wreck the lives of many Hindu under-trials before their cases fell flat.
Curbs on artistic creativity, bans on books, and imprisonment of cartoonists – remember Aseem Trivedi – are not a distant memory under the UPA rule. In fact, the UPA also stands guilty of not aggressively pushing for securing the rights of LGBTQIs as its reaction in 2009 when the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality was guarded. It was only in 2013 when the Supreme Court overturned the 2009 verdict that the Congress’ top brass including Rahul Gandhi spoke openly in favour of equal rights. And if that isn’t enough, its opportunistic alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra represents anything but a commitment to the ‘secular and liberal’ values it claims to champion. It has clearly forgotten the 1992-93 Mumbai riots and the allegations it had leveled against the Shiv Sena over its participation, it has forgotten its own condemnations of the Sena’s acts of vandalism, and its own accusations of its now-ally’s ‘fascist’ leanings.
If that leaves Mamata Banerjee as a liberal alternative, one has to worry about the fate of liberalism in India. Her stature as a popular bulwark against the BJP in West Bengal has, among the BJP’s critics, overshadowed the discourse around her own illiberal instincts, including jailing those who’ve caricatured her, and the violence of her party workers to preserve the hegemony the TMC currently enjoys in West Bengal. If the BJP’s Hindutva assertion is a cause for alarm, Mamata Banerjee’s desperation in ensuring the Muslim vote bank in West Bengal remains hers has been a recipe for polarization. And if one looks upon Mamata as a feminist for having fielded more women as candidates than her rivals, her party’s confused response to triple talaaq, her silence on Sabarimala, or her callous reaction in 2012 to the Park Street rape are hardly assuring.
As for the AAP, many experts have speculated about their national viability after their triumph in Delhi. But Arvind Kejriwal’s strategy of steering clear from commenting on ‘national’ issues, and preferring safety in silence than taking a position and drawing controversy clearly meant that he was shying away from an ideological fight.
But liberalism is alive, among the people and among certain institutions. The protests around the country against the CAA and the NRC cannot be simply dismissed as an overall expression of assertion by the Islamic fringe. Though it is undeniable that several radical Muslims have become involved, people from across faiths and across cities have participated in a movement that they believe is a necessary fight to protect the Indian Constitution. One can argue whether these fears are misplaced, but the BJP’s climbdown on the NRC followed its own extremely bellicose campaign linking it with the CAA that only created uncertainty.
The prolonged lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir and the ‘preventive’ arrests of erstwhile allies of the ruling party have evoked considerable criticism, whatever one’s views on Article 370. Civil society was very active in the legal campaign waged against Section 377, and the outrage against regressive practices such as triple talaaq was not confined to Muslim women. The apex court, by and large, has been receptive to this liberal impulse, be it in its decision to introspect on its own judgement on homosexuality and deliver a progressive verdict in 2018, decry the sexism and misogyny inherent in the erstwhile adultery law, and upholding India’s identity as a secular state in its unanimous judgement in favour of Hindus in the Ayodhya case. While the Supreme Court’s decision to re-examine its Sabarimala judgement allowing women between the ages of 10 to 50 entry into the temple has upset some liberals, its decision to deliberate on the matter under the larger rubric of women’s rights together with discriminatory traditions in other religions may address the accusation of selectivity that both the court, and liberals, often invite.
But courts, fallible as they are, are an instrument of last resort, when faith in elected representatives has eroded. Unfortunately, that is the case in India. If India’s liberals cringe about the BJP’s free run to its communal rabble-rousers during election campaigns, or the branding of its critics as anti-nationals or part of a discredited ‘Lutyens or Khan Market’ cabal, there’s virtually nothing they can celebrate about the Opposition. India’s liberals know what they’re opposing, and are making their voices heard, but there’s no party they can really support.

102,1617655261-236,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"It’s the process, not the outcome!",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Citycitybangbang/it-s-the-process-not-the-outcome/,"It’s the process, not the outcome!","October 24, 2010, 5:02 PM  IST","More and more voices are emerging on the Ayodhya verdict cautioning us against it and pointing out its flaws. After an initial period of uncertainty, caused by the unusualness of the judicial intervention, the lines are being drawn again. Respected voices from the secular side of the table are increasingly arguing against the court’s acceptance of faith as a legitimate ground upon which to base a decision on property rights. Some have argued that the verdict is a test case for the idea of India and its claims to being a democracy where every group’s interests are guaranteed protection, regardless of their size and importance. The Indian Muslim is hurt but gracious, some argue and the onus is on us to ensure that justice prevails.

It is true that a sensitive case like this becomes a litmus test for any democracy for it forces us to put our money where our mouth is. The demolition of the Babri Masjid was a blot on the idea of India as is the continuing inability of any government to take action against those who orchestrated it. But in this instance, the situation is quite different. A vexatious problem has gone to the court, where it has been given due consideration in the prescribed manner. After going through the due process, a verdict has emerged. No one has argued that the process was compromised in any way, or that the verdict came out under pressure from any side. And as is the right of the litigants, the verdict is being appealed in the Supreme Court.

The attempt to prise open the judgement and argue with its contents is fraught with troublesome consequences. It places the commentator above the law, and infects what is meant to be an impartial process with the contagion of doubt. Questioning the judgement and accusing it of pandering to majoritarian sentiment is to doubt the idea of the court itself. The judicial system is constructed so as to stand outside the pulls and pressures of politics and society; it is only then that it can provide the task of passing judgement on issues. It is interesting that before the judgement, everyone connected with the case promised to abide by the verdict, no matter what it was. The judicial process enjoys immunity from our suspicions about the other persons motives, and this immunity is important to preserve. Providing a super-judgement on top of the verdict is an invitation for every side to do so, in case the Supreme Court decision is not to their liking. Nothing can be more secular than the idea of the judiciary, particularly in a situation like this one where the problem cannot  really  be solved; it can at best be settled. 

In any case, the key argument, that the court is confusing history with faith is also a dangerous one to make. Lets argue this the other way- is historical fact sufficient reason to grant rights to a particular community? If it were historically true that a religious structure of one community was destroyed and replaced with a structure of another faith, would it give the earlier structure an automatic right to exist today? Arguing for a historical basis to this decision is to open a giant can of worms, for where will we stop , how far will we go back and who will adjudicate as to what was a historical fact and what wasn’t? This argument is an open invitation to those who wish to rewrite history, using the ink of today’s power structure and creates an endless spiral of revisionism.

It has also been argued that there is pressure on the Indian Muslim to fall in line and to accept what in this view is a compromised solution. There is some truth to this, but it is troubling that after arguing passionately and quite correctly, that the Muslim is not a single entity when it comes to the challenging the spectre of Global Islamic militancy, how easily we revert to the One Muslim Voice stereotype in this case. Why should there be a unified Muslim reaction to the verdict? As regards the pressure to fall in line, it is true that the exhortation to ‘move on’ is often an expression of the facile reading of history by those privileged enough to be able to ignore it, but in a democracy, everyone has a right to express their opinion and in any case, in the larger scheme of things, this pressure is irrelevant. What matters is what the Supreme Court thinks.

In a case like this, the search for a technical version of justice is futile. It is important to acknowledge that there are two sides to this dispute and that any lasting solution must accommodate both. The details of what this nature of accommodation are, should not engage us too much as long as the process we follow is above reproach. The test of the idea of India is the guarantee that we provide on the process, not on the outcome. Let us pretend that the court is a black box from which a verdict will emerge, which we will embrace no matter what. If it gives something to both sides, then we cannot hope for anything more. If not, the grounds for rejecting the final verdict have already been laid. Today it is by one side, tomorrow it could be the other. And that is very bad news.

On the heels of BJP’s political dominance, an attendant quest is to understand how RSS locates its ideology in 21st century India. How does it now view emotive issues such as Ram Janmabhoomi movement and uniform civil code (UCC) from its position as the ideological anchor of the ruling party? Sunil Ambekar, a pracharak in RSS and the national organising secretary of its students wing ABVP, has tried to articulate the organisation’s current views through a book which details its world view. He speaks to Indrajeet Rai on the Sangh’s viewpoint on issues old and new:
Is Hindutva essentially anti-Muslim?
Hindutva is not divisive. It never was. It is a unifying factor. The ‘tatva’ in Hindutva always looks for unifying factors in different communities. In fact, Hindus and Muslims have same ancestors. We may look different and may have different praying styles today, but our ancestors were the same.
The RSS is not against Muslims. Sangh is against any kind of separatism. In fact, we opposed Partition. We wanted to keep Hindus and Muslims together. We are not against anyone.
Hindutva is not against any religion or any person, be it Muslims or Jews. The Sangh is against Islamic terror. Not only RSS, but the entire world, including Muslim-majority nations, are raising their voice against Islamic terror.
What about some important Hindutva concerns like Ram Janmabhoomi temple, cow protection, UCC and Article 370?
Let’s wait for the Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya. We have waited so long for the court verdict to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The RSS will abide by the SC judgment.
What if the SC verdict is not in favour of making a Ram temple?
Whatever happens will be within the constitutional framework. We will explore all constitutional means to build the Ram temple.
What about ‘Yeh toh kewal jhanki hai, Kashi, Mathura baaki hai (Ayodhya was just a glimpse, Kashi and Mathura remain unresolved)’?
Let’s just discuss the Ram temple issue for now. We should wait for the SC judgment on Ayodhya.
Article 370 is for all practical purposes abrogated. Once the temple issue is settled, will RSS work for the enactment of a UCC?
Till now, there has been no fair debate over the need for a UCC. Only in last few years, have we started discussing it. The idea of a UCC is to redress injustice against any community. These demands are being raised from within communities. Take the issue of triple talaq. The demand to scrap the practice of triple talaq was raised by Muslim women. The government and court came together and abolished the practice.
The enactment of a UCC is one of many issues that need to be resolved. There are many other pressing problems that we need to address. For instance, the problem of rising population is a concern for all. Environmental challenges are same for everyone. How to stop animal slaughter is an issue for all. ‘Save tiger’ and ‘save cow’ are equally important for me. How can ‘save tiger’ be secular and ‘save cow’ be communal?
There is a kind of hypocrisy and political agenda behind raising selective issues. Some people are making a selective list of killings and raising a hue and cry about it, but they are not discussing terrorism and Naxalism. No one is making a list of terror and Naxal violence victims. Don’t play politics over these issues. The RSS chief has talked about lynching in his Vijayadashmi speech. Lynching is not our tradition; it is an alien concept.
You have discussed family and emerging modern relationships in your work. What does RSS think about rights of the LGBTQ+ community?
The RSS is working on thousands of issues. We should discuss about farmers, rural and many other important issues. All these issues are important. But I think we should have a humanitarian approach towards the LGBTQ+ community.
We all know that RSS and BJP share a close relationship. How much has the BJP-led government at the Centre helped in the growth of RSS?
The Sangh works in an organic way. We approach people through our branches. Now, people are joining us through our website too. RSS kept growing even when it was banned. The Sangh is growing at its own pace. The Sangh keeps growing in spite of all odds.
What do you have to say about the ongoing power tussle between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra?
This is not my subject. I don’t think I should comment on this.

     Can a political rule stem from a pseudo-religious faith... stewed in identity politics... superficial holy cosmetic cover... most of the present regime tops are hard-core RSS cadre in the past...? Genuine politics focuses on multiple issues... upgrades.. drawing best of stalwarts from crucial fields... into the decision making apparatus...? Dedicated devotees focus on inner realms... while politics is an outer pursuit on specifics progress excellence in arenas of economic/scientific reckoning....? How can both be mixed...? Political rule... roles of institutions... their key slots chosen on political loyalty other things being equal... or even compromised to an extent... the deep rot in systems & processes yet to be revisited at large... can the politically motivated mis-adventures sustain for long... while scenes unfold in bitter angles - cover up or hypocrisy - talk sweetly, do the opposite -- take care of the national steam & spirit... can the Sun rays be covered by a colored huge blanket.....? :-) GOK...

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",on the heels of bjps political dominance an attendant quest is to understand how rss locates its ideology in 21st century india how does it now view emotive issues such as ram janmabhoomi movement and uniform civil code ucc from its position as the ideological anchor of the ruling party sunil ambekar a pracharak in rss and the national organising secretary of its students wing abvp has tried to articulate the organisations current views through a book which details its world view he speaks to indrajeet rai on the sanghs viewpoint on issues old and newis hindutva essentially antimuslimhindutva is not divisive it never was it is a unifying factor the tatva in hindutva always looks for unifying factors in different communities in fact hindus and muslims have same ancestors we may look different and may have different praying styles today but our ancestors were the samethe rss is not against muslims sangh is against any kind of separatism in fact we opposed partition we wanted to keep hindus and muslims together we are not against anyonehindutva is not against any religion or any person be it muslims or jews the sangh is against islamic terror not only rss but the entire world including muslimmajority nations are raising their voice against islamic terrorwhat about some important hindutva concerns like ram janmabhoomi temple cow protection ucc and article 370lets wait for the supreme court judgment on ayodhya we have waited so long for the court verdict to build the ram temple in ayodhya the rss will abide by the sc judgmentwhat if the sc verdict is not in favour of making a ram templewhatever happens will be within the constitutional framework we will explore all constitutional means to build the ram templewhat about yeh toh kewal jhanki hai kashi mathura baaki hai ayodhya was just a glimpse kashi and mathura remain unresolvedlets just discuss the ram temple issue for now we should wait for the sc judgment on ayodhyaarticle 370 is for all practical purposes abrogated once the temple issue is settled will rss work for the enactment of a ucctill now there has been no fair debate over the need for a ucc only in last few years have we started discussing it the idea of a ucc is to redress injustice against any community these demands are being raised from within communities take the issue of triple talaq the demand to scrap the practice of triple talaq was raised by muslim women the government and court came together and abolished the practicethe enactment of a ucc is one of many issues that need to be resolved there are many other pressing problems that we need to address for instance the problem of rising population is a concern for all environmental challenges are same for everyone how to stop animal slaughter is an issue for all save tiger and save cow are equally important for me how can save tiger be secular and save cow be communalthere is a kind of hypocrisy and political agenda behind raising selective issues some people are making a selective list of killings and raising a hue and cry about it but they are not discussing terrorism and naxalism no one is making a list of terror and naxal violence victims dont play politics over these issues the rss chief has talked about lynching in his vijayadashmi speech lynching is not our tradition it is an alien conceptyou have discussed family and emerging modern relationships in your work what does rss think about rights of the lgbtq communitythe rss is working on thousands of issues we should discuss about farmers rural and many other important issues all these issues are important but i think we should have a humanitarian approach towards the lgbtq communitywe all know that rss and bjp share a close relationship how much has the bjpled government at the centre helped in the growth of rssthe sangh works in an organic way we approach people through our branches now people are joining us through our website too rss kept growing even when it was banned the sangh is growing at its own pace the sangh keeps growing in spite of all oddswhat do you have to say about the ongoing power tussle between bjp and shiv sena in maharashtrathis is not my subject i dont think i should comment on this

104,1617655130-207,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Good sense must prevail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/abhiram/good-sense-must-prevail/,Good sense must prevail,"November 4, 2019, 8:52 AM  IST","As the date of final verdict by the Hon’ble Supreme Court over the disputed land (Ram Janam Bhoomi – Babri Masjid) between Hindus and Muslims regarding its ownership title in Ayodhya is approaching near, both the communities need to maintain utmost restraint and due respect for each other, so that it may become a landmark moment and historic opportunity for building a new foundation of perpetual peace and communal harmony between them.
As obvious the verdict will go in favour of the either party to the dispute, but that will, after all, be the judgement by the Hon’ble apex court of the country; that must be sincerely honoured by both the Hindus as well as the Muslims, without jumping into any kind of public celebrations as that may arouse a kind of communal feeling or narrow sectarianism.
Evidently such celebrations over judgement by the one party to the dispute will hurt the feelings of the opposite side, though this must not happen because they had themselves knocked the door of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In fact, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had, from very beginning, appealed to both of them to strive hard to arrive at an amicable solution to the dispute as it is an issue of their faith over the disputed land.
Unfortunately, the dispute has already assumed very high religious and communal overtones due to vicious politicisation and communalisation by different political parties and socio-religious organisations in both the communities. And that has already led to sharpening of division and widening of social gaps between them along religious and communal lines by sticking to their hard attitude towards their distinct identity and unique cultural attributes. Further, their noble, religious and moral sentiments have also been fanned towards exclusiveness, who otherwise long for peace, solidarity, prosperity and progress so as to earn their bread and butter under normal and peaceful situations, against the worsening scenario of environmental pollution, depleting potable water level, food crisis, energy crisis, terrorism and various other social, cultural, economic and political challenges in the country.
As the dispute has already witnessed many unfortunate incidents and tensions in the past during its long course of troubled and violent history, the forthcoming judgement will bring out the fact, based upon evidences, in black and white and that must be honoured by both the parties so as to put at rest all chances of recurrence of any trouble in future and also in the common interest of peace & prosperity and welfare of all, irrespective of caste, creed and community etc..
Fortunately, there is a welcome sign today that now all Muslim clerics as well as Hindu leaders, including RSS, have already come out open in favour of maintaining peace and calm in the post-verdict scenario in the country and also elsewhere in the world. Hence, both the communities and also the political parties and their promoted and patronised socio-religious organisations must honour the coming verdict to let the good sense prevail over minor differences in the larger interest of humanity, suffering grave challenges of various forms of threats to the mortal existence in this temporal world. This may happen as nothing is beyond human endeavour.

105,1617655469-288,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/1/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Why Ayodhya verdict is a moral victory for Muslims and an Agni Pakisha for Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Introspection/why-ayodhya-verdict-is-a-moral-victory-for-muslims-and-an-agni-pakisha-for-hindus/,Why Ayodhya verdict is a moral victory for Muslims and an Agni Pakisha for Hindus,"November 12, 2019, 10:59 PM  IST","The Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya title suit is a moral victory for Muslims, although they were deprived of the justice as per the expectations. On the other hand despite giving the land to Hindus, the judgement puts Hindus – who have not been `Modified’ yet – on the path of Agni Pariksha that will decide whether the democracy in India will be dictated by the rule of law enshrined in the Constitution framed by our freedom fighters or majoritarianism espoused by the ruling Sangh Parivar.
The Agni Pariksha for Hindus now is to resist majoritarianism with all their might like Mahatma Gandhi did in 1948. Simply, because the biggest threat to democracy comes from within, when people start believing that democracy means rule of majority. This is the narrative which we have seen gradually gaining ground and poisoning the minds of the Hindus after the launch of the Ram Temple movement in 1980s and in the subsequent three decades claiming thousands of lives in communal clashes in the country.
The verdict emphasised on the rule of law in its observations, but ended up strengthening the notion that majority is right. Though the SC handed over the land to Hindus, it acknowledged that there is no proof that the mosque was built after demolishing a temple and described installation of idols in the mosque in 1949 and demolition of the mosque in 1992 as illegal acts, which is in consonance with the stand Muslims have maintained all along.
It exposes the propaganda of Sangh Parivar which for years has been arguing that Babri mosque was a matter of shame for Hindus and a symbol of slavery and tyranny as it was constructed on the ruins of a temple. The arguments were used to justify installation of idols and demolition of the mosque and stoke communal passions that helped BJP to grab power. But now, Muslims have been proved right, which in my view is a big moral victory. However, on the other hand, the SC, in contradiction of its observations, unwittingly awarded those who were behind the illegal acts.
Nevertheless, the `balancing act’ by the judges in the judgment may put an end to the divisive issue that was successfully used by the saffron brigade to win elections one after another and destroy social and constitutional fabric of the country, which may pave way for reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims.
However, at the same time, as of now it appears to have provided a free and unrestricted passage to the Hindutava march for rolling out its plan to change the constitutional character of the nation. Many see SC as the last and the most formidable barrier to stop the saffron brigade from trampling the idea of India conceptualised by our freedom fighters.
After the verdict, the RSS leaders announced that Kashi and Mathura are not on their agenda, but they cannot be trusted because similar deceptive promises were made before demolition of the Babri mosque. Now, they have a legal precedence to repeat similar act in future as and when required to keep them in power and divert public attention from real issues. They will also use it to implement their ultimate aim of converting India into Hindu Rashtra by changing the Constitution.
However, at a time when pillars of democracy are falling one after another, I still have faith in country’s judicial system and hopeful that it will help in fight against majoritarianism as it did in overturning some of the decisions taken during emergency period, but the responsibility to use it tactfully for defending the Constitution is now on the Hindus, who still believe in the idea of India for which Bhagat Singh, Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi sacrificed their lives.
Those justifying majoritarianism, cite India’s partition in 1947 on religious grounds and provoke people through selective and distorted account of medieval history. What the votaries of the constitutional values have to make modified Hindus realise that our founding fathers had chosen the rule of law over majoritarianism because it guarantees and guards the rights and interest of every individual including the last one in the queue.
These Hindus also need to be told that as cheating in examination cannot be allowed even if majority students in class support it, majoritarianism cannot become legal despite support of the majority because it is against the spirit of the Constitution. If allowed, it will trigger a nuclear fission that will catastrophic for the constitutional democracy, which will adversely affect Hindus as well.
Modified Hindus will have to understand that the rule of law including secularism is equally important for them as it is for minorities because it also protects their rights to preserve their languages and diverse culture as well, besides freedom to choose from various sects of Hinduism they want to follow.
The concept of Hindu Rashtra where all minorities are relegated to second class citizens may sound seductive to some Hindus but they do not realise that it will give rise to new generation of power grabbers who will mobilise the community – which in that situation will constitute majority among Hindus – to make their will to reign supreme. There will also be bickering among followers of Hindutava, a glimpse of which can today be seen in Maharastra after assembly elections.
Not just political, such `majority domination’ among Hindus can be sectarian, ethnic, lingual, regional, sub-nationalism, racism and castism. The breakdown will continue till you will find yourself standing alone. Then, the rule of law alone will be the only instrument left to protect your rights. The situation may also give rise to separatism among minorities leading to increase in religion terrorism or a civil war because there is no dearth of people and forces on the other side who will use the opportunity to further their political agenda.
This is the reason why Bhagat Singh wanted free India to be secular and socialist and Subhas Chandra Bose was of the view that communalism by majority should be crushed, if required, by force. For the same reason, Sardar Patel banned organizations advocating majoritarianism. It also explains why Bhimrao Ambedkar was against Hindu Rashtra.
Hindus need to think whether they will carry forward the baton handed over to them by freedom fighters or follow demagogues who are follower of those who cooperated with British?
Last not the least – The SC has given a golden opportunity to Hindus to rebuild Babri Mosque at the same spot and hand it over to Muslims to uphold constitutional values. I am sure the omnipresent Ram will be more pleased by this act of compassion and redemption for committing the sin of demolishing a place of worship.
This will then be moral victory of Hinduism – the same Hinduism which was defined by Swami Viveknanad in Chicago on September 11, 1893 in Parliament of World’s religion amid thunderous applause from representatives of various religions from across the world.

106,1617655203-223,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/4/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Temple for peace and prosperity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-editorials/temple-for-peace-and-prosperity/,Temple for peace and prosperity,"August 5, 2020, 11:21 PM  IST","Bhumi Pujan, or ceremonial stone-laying, for a Ram temple at Ayodhya should bring the curtain firmly down on a chapter of division and hatred in the history of independent India and begin one of inclusive politics.
As a nation and a people, we need to look to the future, build a future of our choosing, one that will make us stronger and more capable, more productive and prosperous.
Challenges beckon without; internal cohesion is what will allow us to take them on and succeed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reminder of what ‘Ram Rajya’ means — social harmony — is welcome, especially in the context of the mandir’s turbulent history.
He also spoke about how the deity, one of India’s most beloved cultural symbols, has taught us how to ‘commit to our responsibilities’, underlining not just the kartavya that governments have towards its people, but also the duty the people have to the nation.
The temple is being built with legal sanction, on land accorded by the verdict of the highest court of the land. The same verdict that gave the green signal for the temple’s construction at a site many believe to be Ram’s birthplace, not only allotted land for the construction of a mosque but also termed the destruction of the 16th-century mosque at the site where the temple is now being built ‘a criminal act’.
The seeming contradiction between criminality of demolishing a mosque and sanctity of building a temple where the demolished mosque stood can be resolved only in assigning a sweeping reach to the correcting of historical wrongs by judicial intervention.
Would it have ordered its demolition or its shifting to a different location, to make room for a temple if the mosque had stood? Ironically, the court has been absolved of having to address that question.
‘Your place is in the minds of all good people,’ replied Valmiki to visiting Ram’s query as to where in the ashram he should sleep, says the Ramayan. Ram now will have a grand physical abode as well. Peace and quiet should follow, not triumphalism that disrespects the norms of governance, which Ram valued above everything else, including the feelings of his loved ones.

     The most generous interpretation of the apex court verdict is that it wished to draw a curtain over a long festering wound. Bring legal closure, investing its majesty to an outcome which may not have been acceptable if it had come from arbitration or negotiation. The judgment now casts a duty on state and all citizens to prove worthy of the ideals of Lord Ram who will be honoured and cast in stone at this site. 2. A simple message should travel to the four corners of India, with the subtlety of a thunderclap.  No more hate crime against Muslims, especially related to the holy cow. Any such incidents - one took place in Gurgaon recently - will be treated as crimes against the state. 3. For Indiaâ  s 200 million Muslims, this solemn ground breaking ceremony should be an important milestone, setting them free from fear....  Read More

107,1617655293-244,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/3/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Of politics and dissent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/beyond-the-fact/of-politics-and-dissent/,Of politics and dissent,"December 21, 2019, 11:22 PM  IST","Groucho Max once observed, “Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies”. . . and thereby remaining in controversies keeping people engaged in unnecessary things to keep them away from necessary things.
Right from last general elections, the country is grossly engaged in politics and politics only, the entire society is just carried away, rather carried over, towards Art 370/35a, Sabrimala, govt formations in Haryana and Maharashtra, Ramjanmbhoomi and now CAA – as if all the issues of hunger and poverty, of education and living, of employment and livelihood etc etc have been sorted out and solved to our satisfaction and we have now enough time of having the luxury of engaging ourselves in either supporting or opposing the issues not even remotely effecting the poor, downtrodden and struggling to meet the both ends.
Come 23rd and we would have new topic of Jharkhand govt formation – plus and minus of it and based on what happens, we would be ready with our justifications and analysis and these talks may take few more days, if not weeks.
No media, no political party, no pressure group, no intellectual has really any time left to them to talk about rising price of potato now after soaring onions – the poor being left with only salt over their dry rotis. So nice of the govt, which came into being showing so many dreams to them and so nice of all the stakeholders of the system justifying and glorifying public mandate for growth and prosperity, for a cohesive and developed India, for a society with peace and warmth. 
And an ever new trend has emerged asserting that most of the people protesting against an issue, are not aware of the issue altogether meaning thereby people are either misguided or hired to protest by the opposition – having either vested interests or taking Pakistan line and thereby being antinational.
And I went back to the people at large – the real people at the ridge, just chanting Modi Modi all the way day and night who pushed Lotus button – and most of them did not know why they did vote for Modi. So? Does this mean that they were just manipulated or instigated (or hired?) to vote for Modi? Was or is the madness about Modi was wrong? Was the passion of the people that a change – an overall change – would come with Modi, a dilemma? 
At least a hundred of people attached with my family one way or the other would come and ask my grandfather – Baba whom to vote for – and my grandfather would suggest them this side or that side and they might have just adhered to that. Did my grandfather have vested interest in doing that and were the people respecting just playing in his hands? DO the illiterate laborers in the remote village of UP wearing amulet of Modi picture in his neck, not knowing anything about BJP and without any explanation for that, is a misguided or hired guy? 
And for that matter, did the people following Gandhi – the poor and illiterate – doing everything as asked for by Bapu, know what they were doing or why they were doing what they were doing?  
In fact, we Indians are too passionate people – passionate to the extent of being mad – and often swayed away by whosoever has the art of encashing the passion. Indira ji did it with Garibi Hatao and Modi ji Bhastchar Mitao and Desh Bachao. Example of Indira ji – because post Nehru people showed love and madness for only these two leaders of the nation. 
Paradox of politics is that if the madness is for them it is positive and respectful mandate, but if there are dissenting voices, they tend to become synonym for sedition and this happens more with the leaders elected with mammoth mandate for they often live in illusion that people’s mandate is eternal. They do not appreciate the fact that people’s mandate is often mercurial and true leaders do always try keeping pace with its surge and slide. 
Not all the protesters and dissenters of any govt move – from J&K resolution to CAA – are misguided and hired, most of them are in their brains and know what and why of their doings. They might be dissenters, at times even rebellions, but not enemies of either the govt or the nation. And though the govt might have been formed by the majority party but it becomes a nation’s govt, living a national ethos and trying doing good for each of the citizens. Of course, it is not always possible to keep all on same page and it is not necessary too.
Doing things by majority is a matter of convenience of democracy, it is not the essence of democracy. The essence remains doing good for all by the majority – not doing good only to majority by the majority. And let it be confirmed that this govt has the firm grip over the people at large – it honestly wished peace and calm after Ayodhya verdict, it did achieve it fully and completely. So the govt or media need not be resorting to terming the dissenters as a misguided lot only. This has to be dealt with gracefully and decently.   
The CAA protests have taken place at many states – remarkably Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, UP – why the handling has been so arrogant in UP and so descant in Maharashtra? 
BJP, after ruling the country for more than 5 years now needs to grow up and make a habit of ignoring certain things. CAA is law of the land now and if there are people protesting it, govt has to handle it prudently than harshly, if it has a clear and without prejudice intent. It has to have a defined mechanism to handle dissents and it would be naïve to presume that there would be 100% acceptability of whatever it does.
Two things are quite apparent – One, few leaders of the ruling party show arrogance in public by their statements as well as body language – arrogance enough to offend people despite caution by not less than Prime Minister himself. Two, the govt does not appear to do enough homework before taking a decision on, especially, contentious issues. It often appears to have been trapped in its own web. 
Protests, dissents and demonstration are the sign of a vibrant and dynamic democracy. Handling them are an art of politik and administration – away from politics this requires the statesmanship. It looks awkward that anyone in the govt talks out on any of the issues. This causes avoidable contradictions and overlapping. It would be prudent to have a tiny group of leaders in govt to handle the issues of public concerns. 
And somehow or the other, of late, people feel that Modi ji is running out of ideas. He does not appear to have the same enthusiasm and interest as his first term. This public perception is not at all good and Modi ji has to ensure more grip over the ethos, spirit and doings of his govt. 
A leader has to come up, take charge and ownership. The true leader goes by public opinion but at the same time moulds and shapes it as well. As Augustus Hare puts it “A statesman should follow public opinion. Doubtless, as a coachman follows his horses, having firm hold on the reins and guiding them”.

108,1617655112-202,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,The elections & after,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Citycitybangbang/the-elections-after/,The elections & after,"December 16, 2018, 8:10 PM  IST","The state elections are over and the countdown to 2019 has begun. The Congress has made some definite gains and the BJP’s aura of invincibility has been dented quite significantly. It squeaked through in Gujarat, could not quite make the grade in Karnataka and now has lost in 3 major Hindi heartland states. Mr Modi’s personal brand, too, has taken a hit, and in comparison, Rahul Gandhi has become a more serious rival. Head-to-head, the gap is still wide, but that may not matter for unlike 2014, 2019 is looking less like a Presidential-style election, and more in the mould of conventional Indian elections.
Can this result be read as a rebuke to the communally charged campaign that the BJP has been carrying out? Has the Indian electorate begun to reject the BJP because of what it sees as the attempts to promote a divisive agenda? Or can the BJP, by activating the Ayodhya issue extract more electoral mileage out of this fault-line?
Tempting as that reading is for those opposed to the BJP’s approach, to believe that the elections point to a rejection of its Hindutva agenda would be to over-read the verdict. There is a market for a communally charged agenda, but it finds different expressions and operates at different intensities, depending on the constituency in question.
The first group is a relatively small but significant set of hardcore supporters of the party that are committed to its Hindutva agenda and for whom the party’s anti-Muslim stance is the defining reason for its support. This group sees the victimisation of Hindus as the central issue of the time, and would back any and every move that furthers this cause. Had this group been larger, the BJP would have breezed through all elections, but that is clearly not the case.
There is another group, particularly amongst the educated middle class, that supports the party largely because it is led by Narendra Modi. The idea of a strong leader who empowers those that see themselves as the cultural mainstream is a very alluring one. At an overt level, the aggressive Hindutva hardline is not articulated as a reason for supporting the BJP, but it is rare to find this group getting upset about any excesses committed in its name. The framing of the appeal of leaders like Mr Modi, Mr Shah and Yogi Adityanath, tends to be through the labels of strength and decisiveness, and not through that of Hindutva, although clearly, that is very much part of the party’s appeal. For this group, the support for the party is largely intact, even if the intensity of support might have dimmed a bit,
Then there is a set of voters that aligned with the BJP largely because of its developmental agenda, thanks to Mr Modi’s image the aura around his work in Gujarat. They share no particular affinity for the Hindutva part of the proposition, seeing as a necessary if somewhat undesirable price to pay for their support of the party. This lot has seen a clear erosion of support, with a sense that their hopes of transformative change have been belied and the increasingly strident noises being made by the party on the Hindutva is making them uncomfortable. 
The largest group is perhaps of those that are not averse to a Hindu slant that the party displays, but do not see this axis as the one most central to their lives. They may not actively object to the party’s posture, but do not see it as the reason to support it. They do not actively support the more extreme elements of the party, but are unlikely to vote against the party for this reason. Only in case of extreme events like riots and wars, would their Hindu identity become an electoral issue. For them, the defining issues governing their electoral decisions today, have to do with issues of livelihoods and governance rather than culture and religion. This group feels let down by the party, having seen little change and in many cases, being adversely affected by demonetisation and the complex GST regime. For the BJP, this group, particularly in the Hindi heartland, is both a problem and opportunity, for in theory, it can be activated through more aggressive acts of polarisation.
How is the BJP likely to read the results? Will it rethink its emphasis on its Hindutva track, and the role that it has accorded to someone like Yogi Adityanath? The problem that the BJP faces is that whenever it finds itself on the back foot, regardless of what is a strategically more productive path to take, its natural instinct is to go deeper and more aggressively into the cultural side of its proposition. The preliminary analyses within the party after these results, indicate that the losses are being interpreted as arising out of too little rather than too much Hindutva.  
On the face of it, that is a risky strategy today.  If the current results are any indication, there are few incremental votes to be found that way. For the Opposition, the choices are simpler. They have to attack the present regime and be vague about their own promises, for what they seek is a negative vote. The BJP’s biggest problem today is that of attrition, of an erosion of its 2014 support base, rather than the rise of a compelling counterpoint. The party is good at fighting a war, but this situation is different. What it needs to do is to knit together support by aligning with diverse interests. Structurally, the party under the current leadership is uncomfortable with this kind of politics. It is geared to stand firm and not to respond to feedback and sees the world in absolute terms, even when the situation might call for a more nuanced accommodative worldview. The BJP has a difficult choice to make, but chances are that it is capable of making only one of those choices.

     You seem to be part of the gang that is trying to force BJP to give up its Hindutva. BJP will degenerate in to poor man's Congress without Hindutva.

They claim to be committed to Indian Constitution and the principles contained therein. They stand by the principles of pluralism in in all forms and adherence in non-violence – both in word and in action. The membership list of this group reads like the ‘Who’s Who’ list of Civil Services (mainly IAS, IFS, IPS and a few from other civil services) from about 1990 to 2010. They promote their views on their blog and open letters that can be accessed at https://constitutionalconduct.com/. Such initiatives are always welcome as long the intentions are noble and there is no hidden agenda.
In a recent statement the group has expressed its deep concern on the Rule of Law in India and on its citizens’ rights to free speech and dissent, basic elements of any democracy. They believe that the arrest of eleven activists, including Kafeel Khan, Safoora Zargar, Akhil Gogoi and Sharjeel Imam in connection with the anti CAA Protests was unwarranted. The group feels that their arrest seems clearly designed to send a message that criticism of government policies will not be tolerated. They also feel that investigations in NE Delhi riots have an institutional bias against the minority community.
Further, the group says flagrant misuse of draconian laws of sedition and the Unauthorized Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has led to the arrest of journalists, intellectuals, university students, film-makers, human rights activists and popular figures who dared to criticise the present regime. As per CCG detentions in Kashmir of hundreds of political activists and the suspension of communications for several months after the revocation of its special status was a blot on India’s democracy. Finally, the letter ends with an appeal ‘All Indians must unite in defence of the Rule of Law and Article 19, the repository of the democratic right to freedom of speech and to dissent.’ Does this mean that more and more Indians should speak the language of Sharjeel Islam or Safoora Zargar?
The group is very vociferous in defence of bureaucrat turned activist Harsh Mander and supports his speech that he gave at Jamia Milia during the anti CAA riots. They claim that both, NRC and NPR, are not required and CAA is untenable both morally and constitutionally. They have even questioned the Ayodhya verdict by nation’s highest court and charge the government of serious irregularities in the 2019 General elections in the country. These eminent bureaucrats forget that many among them were responsible for initiating NPR and NRC when they were in office.
The group cites pronouncements on India by vague international institutions and organisations like Press Freedom Index of Reporters without Borders, Independent experts like Special Rapporteurs and members of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions to support their claims. Most readers would have never heard of these entities.
Two facts emerge as a common link in many communications issued by CCG. The first is that that NDA government is not upholding the constitution. Secondly it feels the government is biased against minority community (read Muslims). On the whole the group hardly finds anything good or correct happening in the country in recent years, more precisely in last five years. This is where the group’s credibility takes a beating and one wonders if there is a hidden agenda somewhere.
Surely no one can claim by any stretch of imagination that NDA government is not doing anything right or not upholding the constitution of India. If that was the case then India may not have had the kind of international support that it enjoys today. This was evident from the record 184 votes cast in India’s favour at the Security Council for a non-permanent seat in June 2020. If current government was failing on most counts as alleged by CCG, then it would not have come with a clear majority of 353 seats in 2019 elections for a second term under Mr Modi, something that no elected government has achieved since 1971.
These supposedly experienced and nationalistic former bureaucrats conveniently forget that NDA government inherited systems and quality of governance that these very individuals nurtured and left behind as their legacy. They left behind a government machinery that was corrupt, inefficient and anti-citizens in almost every aspect of governance. They encouraged minority appeasement policies for decades that left the majority voiceless. In over six decades India’s poor only became poorer. Internationally the nation was forced to accept belligerence from Pakistan and China meekly. Given this background, is it any wonder that this group fails to appreciate efforts of the current government towards bringing more transparency and efficiency in many aspects of governance apart from giving India a new found stature internationally.
Does giving the majority (85%) a voice in affairs of the nation mean being anti-minority or going against the principle of pluralism? Were the curbs imposed in Kashmir not for safety of the local population when Article 370 was abrogated? Why were they silent, despite some of them holding very key positions, when Kashmir witnessed ethnic cleansing of lakhs of Pundits in 1990-91? Can slogans that seek to break the country be treated as freedom of speech and expression? Can our universities be allowed to become incubators for anti-national elements? Leaders like Kapil Mishra and Thakur made some inflammatory remarks in the run up to Delhi riots and they are guilty of same. But are these comments anywhere close to the deep-rooted conspiracy (with foreign funding) hatched by the minority that is now coming to light after investigations? Has CCG ever pondered over these questions? By being so one dimensional in its criticism of the government, CCG betrays its own fundamental beliefs that stem from the constitution of India. If it lacks faith or casts aspersions on a democratically elected government as prescribed in the constitution, then its motives have to be questioned. Informed and concerned citizens will wonder if there is a hidden agenda aimed at creating dissatisfaction and disenchantment in the country against a democratically elected government.
This supposedly eminent group is turning out to be a carbon copy of what is commonly termed as the ‘Lutyens’s group’. The agendas of both groups seem to have a common ring. The approach of both groups seems to be following the same path. Both resort to establishment (read government) bashing and shun constructive criticism. There is a distinct tilt towards minority appeasement in both groups. They cannot see the writing on the wall today where the majority, that was forced to be silent for decades, wants to be heard too.
The only thing that CCG can hope to achieve by writing such open letters or blogs is to further vitiate public discourse. Any sensible or informed citizen can read between the lines and see that CCG has an agenda that has political and communal overtones. If they believe so strongly in the Indian constitution and are convinced that it is under threat, it may be more prudent for the group to become a political force or align with likeminded political entities. Alternatively, it will not be difficult for them to seek an audience with the President or senior political leadership to express their sincere concerns, if any. Just pelting stones or firing barbs from the side-lines will not help the nation. Unfortunately, it is well known that BJP government neither encourages nor is sympathetic towards stone pelters or barb throwers.

We hesitate to acknowledge the fact that strength is a crucial factor to bring about decisive peace and prosperity. Swami Vivekananda said, “Strength is life, weakness is death. Strength it is that we want so much in this life, for what we call sin and sorrow have all one cause, and that is our weakness. With weakness comes ignorance, and with ignorance comes misery.”
India continued to remain a ‘sone ki chidiya’, a golden bird, so long as she protected herself militarily. In Treta Yuga, Ayodhya was a prosperous and flourishing kingdom because the kings of Suryavansh dynasty were great warriors. King Dasharatha conquered the earth with his combat skills. In Dwapara Yuga, all big kingdoms like those of Kuru, Dwarka, Magadha and Panchala had strong armed forces. The great Mahabharata war was fought with the intent to restore peace and dharma, righteousness.

In medieval times, many kingdoms mushroomed and disappeared really quickly. We remember only those who had a strong military base. Chandragupta Maurya built a large army and redrew the map of India. Even Alexander had to abandon his military campaign in India as he could not face the strong Mauryan army. Later, the great Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji established and expanded the Maratha empire with his guerilla warfare technique. In India’s freedom movement one cannot discount the armed defence the British had to face from the likes of Rani Laxmi Bai and Bhagat Singh.
Today, are we engaged with ahimsa in its real sense or just carried away, conveniently, with the pseudo-ahimsa concept? ‘Ahimsa means non-violence, that is, not hurting or harming anybody’ – but this is an incomplete definition of ahimsa. Its complete definition will be ‘Ahimsa is not hurting or harming anyone who equally understands, respects and follows its principles to the core.’
But, we have been conditioned to believe that ahimsa is an antidote to all evils of society. There are a gazillion slogans and statements describing Satyameva Jayate – truth alone triumphs. It is time we say it differently, ‘satyam saamarthyena jayate’ – truth triumphs when backed by strength. During the battles between Devas and Asuras or between Marathas and Mughals, it is strength, and not righteousness alone, that decided victory. Righteousness, alone, of Devas and Marathas, never got them victory. They won only when they were stronger than their foe. No law, no negotiations, no peace-talks can bring victory by just being righteous. Righteousness has to be backed by physical or armed strength.
There are many evils rampant in Indian society. Extremely worrisome are the physical attacks on women. Women need to ponder over whether any law, alone, will protect them. Will any court’s verdict bring them justice? It is important they learn to defend themselves. ‘Self-defence techniques’ are what every woman in India should learn. For how long will women have to beg for justice? There are organisations that volunteer to teach self-defence techniques to women. I recommend mandatory police or military training for every citizen, especially for women. Strength is the only way to a prosperous society. The pseudo-ahimsa promotion has to stop. A society or nation prospers only when it is strong, and without strength it is doomed.
Let’s not forget that the Bhagwad Gita lessons were expounded on a battlefield and not in a classroom!

     Totally agree with the writer's central idea about Strength as a means for maintaining Peace & Dignity. Ahimsa has to be understood in totality and not just a part of it. A strong foundation is necessary to rise higher....  Read More

And it was no ordinary struggle. It was a test of time, patience and faith.
The five-judge Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the outgoing Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, CJI-designate S. A. Bobde and Justices D. Y. Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan, and S. A. Nazeer declared what the majority of India wanted to hear – resulting in an epoch-making event.
The SC ruled that the underlying structure, below the disputed Ram Janambhoomi–Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya, was not an Islamic structure. And that a temple must be constructed at the disputed site, compensating the Muslims with five acres of land at a prominent place in Ayodhya.
Hanging fire for centuries now, the dispute that started in 1528 AD with the demolition of a Hindu temple has now concluded with a unanimous verdict. And there couldn’t have been a better verdict for a country that exemplifies “unity in diversity”.
Lord Ram – The Essence of India
Lord Ram and Ramayana, the religious text depicting his life, form the core of India. Although there are many sacred Hindu scriptures, but for most of us, our faith in Hinduism flows from two epics: Ramayana and Mahabharata. These define our culture, our Sanskriti, and give meaning to our existence. Their connect with India and Indians is so deep that both these epics find representation in the Constitution of India as well.
In fact, the indelible influence of the Ramayana reverberates in every part of India. Children, right from their early childhood, learn about Lord Ram. In most of our homes, the first religious story that parents and grandparents often teach their children is the story of Lord Ram and Ravan – about the victory of good over evil.
I remember I was only four-year-old when my grandmother started reciting Ramcharitmanas to me. And my love for Ram has grown ever since.
Hailed as the “Maryada Purushottam”, Lord Ram is the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu and the embodiment of truthfulness, righteousness, and compassion.
Today, if you go to the interiors of North India, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, you’ll find that each morning at the houses in these places begins with Ramcharitmanas. Lord Ram and his life remain central to India’s soul. No wonder why most of us are left teary-eyed whenever the Ram Vanvas Prasang comes in Ramayana. For he lies in the heart of Indians. We belong to him, and he belongs to each one of us.
For as long as I can recall, we have been learning about Lord Ram from our religious scriptures and from Ram Leelas that are enacted throughout the country. Transcending the boundaries of caste, creed, and religion, both the participants and the audiences take delight in the lively narratives of the cultural icon, Shri Ram.
In the Sikh Holy Scripture Guru Granth Sahib, his name is recited over two thousand times. Such is his impact on India and its culture that other religions adore him equally.
His story has been narrated in a thousand different languages and in a thousand different ways. But his magnanimity remains the same in every way.
The Significance of Ram Mandir for Hindus
For Hindus, the Ram Janambhoomi in Ayodhya is what Mecca is to Muslims. Apart from being the birthplace of Lord Ram, this very site is the abode of our God and an integral part of our religion. So much so that it’s akin to what the Vatican City, the home to the Pope, means for the Christians.
Today, the Sikh community is excited for the opening of Kartarpur Corridor, which makes one of their holiest sites accessible by crossing the Pakistan border without a visa. But we are sidelining the threat this move may bring along. Perhaps, feelings dominate religions and will continue to do so. Just as the Kartarpur Sahib holds immense significance for the Sikhs, so does the Ram Janambhoomi for the Hindus.
Various Hindus scriptures such as the Skanda Purana and Vasishtha Samhita contain a reference to the birthplace of Lord Ram in the holy city of Ayodhya and describe how one can attain salvation by just having a darshan of the Ram Janambhoomi.
Hindus believe that an ancient temple stood at this land in Ayodhya, on the banks of the river Sarayu. And in 1528, the Mughal emperor Babar allegedly built a mosque by demolishing this temple – giving birth to a dispute that claimed millions of lives over the years.
In 1885, Mahant Raghubir Das filed a suit seeking permission to build a temple on the chabutra (courtyard) of the Babri mosque. But his plea got rejected by the Faizabad court.
In the mid-1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) spearheaded the ‘Ram Mandir’ campaign to reclaim the disputed site for Hindus.
In 1989, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi allowed the VHP to carry out Shilanayas (laying of the foundation stone) near the disputed area.
Then, in 1990, L. K. Advani launched the “Rath Yatra” from Gujarat to Ayodhya to garner support for the movement.
On December 6, 1992, the Babri Masjid was demolished by a mob of kar sevaks, fuelling the title dispute over the 2.77 acres of land.
Although the disputed title case moved the Supreme Court in 2010 after the Allahabad High Court’s judgement to divide the land between three parties: one-third to the Sunni Wakf Board, one-third to the Nirmohi Akhara and one-third to Ram Lalla Virajman, Hindus have been fighting for Ram Mandir since 1528.
Finally, the centuries-old religious dispute that kept India’s politics burning for the past so many decades ended in 2019, making us feel fortunate enough to witness this landmark day in Indian history.
The Abandonment of Ayodhya and the Collapse of Congress
“Though my reason and heart long ago realized the highest attribute and name of God as Truth, I recognize Truth by the name of Rama. In the darkest hour of my trial, that one name has saved me and is still saving me.”
Such was the influence of Lord Ram on Mahatma Gandhi.
Just like millions of Indians, he was a true Ram bhakt. Throughout his life, he didn’t just chant Lord Ram’s name but lived by his example. Similar to Lord Ram’s life, which demonstrated simplicity, simplicity, self-sacrifice, and renunciation, Mahatma Gandhi’s life too draws on these virtues.
Just like Lord Ram went on a fourteen-year exile to the forest to serve his life’s purpose, leaving all the worldly pleasures behind, Mahatma Gandhi too wore the garb of a sanyasi after returning from South Africa in 1915 and fought for India’s independence by walking extensively throughout the country.
Following the ideals set by Lord Ram, most of the movements that he led were padyatras, especially the Dandi March, seeking inspiration from Lord Ram’s trudge to the dense forests of Dandakaranya.
He was so inspired by Lord Ram that he even visualized the concept of Ram Rajya for an independent India – an ideal state where justice and equality prevail.
This vision was later proselytized by Rajiv Gandhi. In 1989, from Ayodhya, his election speech started with a pledge to bring Ram Rajya in the country. Rajiv Gandhi also realized that Ramayana and Mahabharta are central to India’s character. He was of the opinion that Indian television should broadcast serials that depict the values held in our ancient texts. That’s why, on his advice in 1985, Doordarshan started telecasting Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan and B.R. Chopra’s Mahabharat.
His actions validate his love for Lord Ram and the Janambhoomi. In 1986, he convinced the then Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Bir Bahadur Singh, to open the locks of the Ram Janambhoomi temple and gave Hindus access to the birthplace of their Ram Lalla. Then, in November 1989, he sent the then home minister, Buta Singh, to Ayodhya to participate in the Shilanyas ceremony of the temple.
Also, not many people know (and, of course, Congress will not acknowledge this), but during Rajiv Gandhi’s last press conference at the old Meenambakkam airport in Chennai, he mentioned about building the Ram Mandir with the consensus of all concerned. When a journalist asked him where would the Ram Mandir be built. His reply was “Why, in Ayodhya, of course. Isn’t that obvious?”

After Mahatma Gandhi, it was only Rajiv Gandhi who understood the importance of Ram Mandir. If his government would have returned to power in 1989, the temple may have been built long back.
Even Subramanian Swamy, a staunch critic of the Nehru-Gandhi family, once said, “I have known Rajiv Gandhi very well. Had he become Prime Minister once again, he would have definitely constructed the Ram Temple at the same place (where the demolished Babri mosque stood).”
These words from an Opposition leader very well corroborate Rajiv Gandhi’s intent to build Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Unfortunately, his untimely demise not only buried this vision but also led to the downfall of the Congress party. His legatees couldn’t do justice to the hardheaded Ayodhya policy that Rajiv once commissioned.
After his assassination, Congress abandoned the Ram Mandir issue. And the BJP sensibly embraced it, becoming an unstoppable juggernaut. On the one hand, Congress gradually developed a phobia for Ram, Ramayana, and Ram Rajya. On the other hand, the BJP mobilized Hindus using the highly emotive issue and emerged as a dominant political force in the country.
Ever since Congress abandoned Ayodhya, Hindus starting abandoning Congress.
In 2009, when the UPA government filed an affidavit in Supreme Court questioning the existence of Lord Ram, it became a cause célèbre. The religious sentiments of millions of Hindus were hurt, and Congress is still paying a heavy price for what has been a decisive mistake.
Over the years, we never saw any Congress leader talking about Lord Ram. In fact, Ram Naam became Congress party’s bête noire to such an extent that anyone who takes the name of Lord Ram is termed as Sanghi, communal, bigot, or Hindutva agent by the party members.
The party lost the Ram Mandir narrative and, consequently, lost everything. It lost Uttar Pradesh in 1989 and never regained power in the state. As if that wasn’t enough, the party’s excessive focus on Muslim appeasement led to widespread disenchantment among the Hindus. While it lost Hindus to the BJP, Muslims too drifted away from the Congress in the wake of Babri Masjid demolition. As a result, it lost Muslims to regional outfits like the Samajwadi Party.
The end of Ram Lalla’s exile
With the Muslim community’s gracious acceptance of the Ayodhya verdict, the country’s secular values have been reaffirmed.
But now that the Supreme Court has given three months to the Central government to formulate a trust to build a temple on the disputed site, Indians will certainly wax lyrical about the Modi government in the center and the Yogi government in the state. Well, surely, no one can take away the credit from BJP-RSS on what has been one of the longest movements in the history of any civilization. Nonetheless, the biggest credit should go to Rajiv Gandhi for his efforts. Alas, no one will give credit to him, and his party won’t evenS claim it.
The Congress may have stated that it respects the Supreme Court verdict and is in favour of building Ram Mandir, but the fact that the party failed to say these words earlier can’t be undone. Had Congress made this statement ten years ago, the issue wouldn’t have gone to such an extreme. India’s political scenario would have been different, and so would Congress’ position. The grand old party wouldn’t have lost it all.
But that’s wishful thinking. The reality differs.
The exile of Ram Lalla has finally ended.
As the dust settles in the Congress castle, the party must reflect on how it failed to respect its former Prime Minister’s views and decision to work for the Ram Mandir.
Neither the Hindus have won, nor the Muslims have lost. This victory is for the entire nation. There are no individual winners, and certainly no losers. Except one. And that’s the Congress party.

              Double vision: Islamabad’s U-turn on trade with India is telling",on november 9 2019 a struggle of 491 years ended with a historic judgement and it was no ordinary struggle it was a test of time patience and faiththe fivejudge constitutional bench of the supreme court headed by the outgoing chief justice ranjan gogoi cjidesignate s a bobde and justices d y chandrachud ashok bhushan and s a nazeer declared what the majority of india wanted to hear – resulting in an epochmaking eventthe sc ruled that the underlying structure below the disputed ram janambhoomi–babri masjid site in ayodhya was not an islamic structure and that a temple must be constructed at the disputed site compensating the muslims with five acres of land at a prominent place in ayodhyahanging fire for centuries now the dispute that started in 1528 ad with the demolition of a hindu temple has now concluded with a unanimous verdict and there couldnt have been a better verdict for a country that exemplifies unity in diversitylord ram – the essence of indialord ram and ramayana the religious text depicting his life form the core of india although there are many sacred hindu scriptures but for most of us our faith in hinduism flows from two epics ramayana and mahabharata these define our culture our sanskriti and give meaning to our existence their connect with india and indians is so deep that both these epics find representation in the constitution of india as wellin fact the indelible influence of the ramayana reverberates in every part of india children right from their early childhood learn about lord ram in most of our homes the first religious story that parents and grandparents often teach their children is the story of lord ram and ravan – about the victory of good over evili remember i was only fouryearold when my grandmother started reciting ramcharitmanas to me and my love for ram has grown ever sincehailed as the maryada purushottam lord ram is the seventh incarnation of lord vishnu and the embodiment of truthfulness righteousness and compassiontoday if you go to the interiors of north india especially in states like uttar pradesh and bihar youll find that each morning at the houses in these places begins with ramcharitmanas lord ram and his life remain central to indias soul no wonder why most of us are left tearyeyed whenever the ram vanvas prasang comes in ramayana for he lies in the heart of indians we belong to him and he belongs to each one of usfor as long as i can recall we have been learning about lord ram from our religious scriptures and from ram leelas that are enacted throughout the country transcending the boundaries of caste creed and religion both the participants and the audiences take delight in the lively narratives of the cultural icon shri ramin the sikh holy scripture guru granth sahib his name is recited over two thousand times such is his impact on india and its culture that other religions adore him equallyhis story has been narrated in a thousand different languages and in a thousand different ways but his magnanimity remains the same in every waythe significance of ram mandir for hindusfor hindus the ram janambhoomi in ayodhya is what mecca is to muslims apart from being the birthplace of lord ram this very site is the abode of our god and an integral part of our religion so much so that its akin to what the vatican city the home to the pope means for the christianstoday the sikh community is excited for the opening of kartarpur corridor which makes one of their holiest sites accessible by crossing the pakistan border without a visa but we are sidelining the threat this move may bring along perhaps feelings dominate religions and will continue to do so just as the kartarpur sahib holds immense significance for the sikhs so does the ram janambhoomi for the hindusvarious hindus scriptures such as the skanda purana and vasishtha samhita contain a reference to the birthplace of lord ram in the holy city of ayodhya and describe how one can attain salvation by just having a darshan of the ram janambhoomihindus believe that an ancient temple stood at this land in ayodhya on the banks of the river sarayu and in 1528 the mughal emperor babar allegedly built a mosque by demolishing this temple – giving birth to a dispute that claimed millions of lives over the yearsin 1885 mahant raghubir das filed a suit seeking permission to build a temple on the chabutra courtyard of the babri mosque but his plea got rejected by the faizabad courtin the mid1980s the vishva hindu parishad vhp spearheaded the ram mandir campaign to reclaim the disputed site for hindusin 1989 prime minister rajiv gandhi allowed the vhp to carry out shilanayas laying of the foundation stone near the disputed areathen in 1990 l k advani launched the rath yatra from gujarat to ayodhya to garner support for the movementon december 6 1992 the babri masjid was demolished by a mob of kar sevaks fuelling the title dispute over the 277 acres of landalthough the disputed title case moved the supreme court in 2010 after the allahabad high courts judgement to divide the land between three parties onethird to the sunni wakf board onethird to the nirmohi akhara and onethird to ram lalla virajman hindus have been fighting for ram mandir since 1528finally the centuriesold religious dispute that kept indias politics burning for the past so many decades ended in 2019 making us feel fortunate enough to witness this landmark day in indian historythe abandonment of ayodhya and the collapse of congressthough my reason and heart long ago realized the highest attribute and name of god as truth i recognize truth by the name of rama in the darkest hour of my trial that one name has saved me and is still saving mesuch was the influence of lord ram on mahatma gandhijust like millions of indians he was a true ram bhakt throughout his life he didnt just chant lord rams name but lived by his example similar to lord rams life which demonstrated simplicity simplicity selfsacrifice and renunciation mahatma gandhis life too draws on these virtuesjust like lord ram went on a fourteenyear exile to the forest to serve his lifes purpose leaving all the worldly pleasures behind mahatma gandhi too wore the garb of a sanyasi after returning from south africa in 1915 and fought for indias independence by walking extensively throughout the countryfollowing the ideals set by lord ram most of the movements that he led were padyatras especially the dandi march seeking inspiration from lord rams trudge to the dense forests of dandakaranyahe was so inspired by lord ram that he even visualized the concept of ram rajya for an independent india – an ideal state where justice and equality prevailthis vision was later proselytized by rajiv gandhi in 1989 from ayodhya his election speech started with a pledge to bring ram rajya in the country rajiv gandhi also realized that ramayana and mahabharta are central to indias character he was of the opinion that indian television should broadcast serials that depict the values held in our ancient texts thats why on his advice in 1985 doordarshan started telecasting ramanand sagars ramayan and br chopras mahabharathis actions validate his love for lord ram and the janambhoomi in 1986 he convinced the then uttar pradesh chief minister bir bahadur singh to open the locks of the ram janambhoomi temple and gave hindus access to the birthplace of their ram lalla then in november 1989 he sent the then home minister buta singh to ayodhya to participate in the shilanyas ceremony of the templealso not many people know and of course congress will not acknowledge this but during rajiv gandhis last press conference at the old meenambakkam airport in chennai he mentioned about building the ram mandir with the consensus of all concerned when a journalist asked him where would the ram mandir be built his reply was why in ayodhya of course isnt that obviousafter mahatma gandhi it was only rajiv gandhi who understood the importance of ram mandir if his government would have returned to power in 1989 the temple may have been built long backeven subramanian swamy a staunch critic of the nehrugandhi family once said i have known rajiv gandhi very well had he become prime minister once again he would have definitely constructed the ram temple at the same place where the demolished babri mosque stoodthese words from an opposition leader very well corroborate rajiv gandhis intent to build ram mandir in ayodhya unfortunately his untimely demise not only buried this vision but also led to the downfall of the congress party his legatees couldnt do justice to the hardheaded ayodhya policy that rajiv once commissionedafter his assassination congress abandoned the ram mandir issue and the bjp sensibly embraced it becoming an unstoppable juggernaut on the one hand congress gradually developed a phobia for ram ramayana and ram rajya on the other hand the bjp mobilized hindus using the highly emotive issue and emerged as a dominant political force in the countryever since congress abandoned ayodhya hindus starting abandoning congressin 2009 when the upa government filed an affidavit in supreme court questioning the existence of lord ram it became a cause célèbre the religious sentiments of millions of hindus were hurt and congress is still paying a heavy price for what has been a decisive mistakeover the years we never saw any congress leader talking about lord ram in fact ram naam became congress partys bête noire to such an extent that anyone who takes the name of lord ram is termed as sanghi communal bigot or hindutva agent by the party membersthe party lost the ram mandir narrative and consequently lost everything it lost uttar pradesh in 1989 and never regained power in the state as if that wasnt enough the partys excessive focus on muslim appeasement led to widespread disenchantment among the hindus while it lost hindus to the bjp muslims too drifted away from the congress in the wake of babri masjid demolition as a result it lost muslims to regional outfits like the samajwadi partythe end of ram lallas exilewith the muslim communitys gracious acceptance of the ayodhya verdict the countrys secular values have been reaffirmedbut now that the supreme court has given three months to the central government to formulate a trust to build a temple on the disputed site indians will certainly wax lyrical about the modi government in the center and the yogi government in the state well surely no one can take away the credit from bjprss on what has been one of the longest movements in the history of any civilization nonetheless the biggest credit should go to rajiv gandhi for his efforts alas no one will give credit to him and his party wont evens claim itthe congress may have stated that it respects the supreme court verdict and is in favour of building ram mandir but the fact that the party failed to say these words earlier cant be undone had congress made this statement ten years ago the issue wouldnt have gone to such an extreme indias political scenario would have been different and so would congress position the grand old party wouldnt have lost it allbut thats wishful thinking the reality differsthe exile of ram lalla has finally endedas the dust settles in the congress castle the party must reflect on how it failed to respect its former prime ministers views and decision to work for the ram mandirneither the hindus have won nor the muslims have lost this victory is for the entire nation there are no individual winners and certainly no losers except one and thats the congress party

112,1617655097-198,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Campaign Wahin Banega,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-commentary/campaign-wahin-banega/,Campaign Wahin Banega,"November 8, 2018, 10:58 PM  IST","By Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay
Moments after television channels flashed trends of the three Lok Sabha and two assembly bypolls in Karnataka on Tuesday morning, BJP MLA from Rajajinagar S Suresh Kumar tweeted, ‘Time for genuine introspection.’ Later, when the 4-1verdict against his party was certain, he tweeted again, ‘Time for our cadre-based organisation-party to reinvent itself to get ready for the major exam.’
But recasting itself, especially for an incumbent, is a tall order. It also raises the question: is development then no longer the magic wand holding out hope for all?
Unity in Adversity

The Karnataka bypoll results are short of debacle for BJP for four reasons. First, these five seats were spread across the state and not concentrated in a small pocket. Additionally, Bellary was a BJP bastion since 2004 and its candidate was backed by the mining barons, Reddy brothers. Second, the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance tided over several self-inflicted challenges to its stability, and is now more sure-footed. Leaders of the two parties will now find greater virtue in sticking with one another.
Third, these results, barely six months after BJP’s stunning defeat in Kairana, Uttar Pradesh, serve a reminder to non-BJP parties that state-level strategic alliances are the only way to stop BJP. Fourth, the defeats are signs of BJP’s inability to regain political momentum and reverse its electoral downslide after the Gujarat assembly polls.
It’s been a quarter-of-a-century since BJP learnt that big political messages and spectacular accomplishments do not necessarily deliver victories in the first-past-the-post system. The Babri Masjid’s demolition in December 1992 was a major triumph.
The event ‘mainstreamed’ the argument that the mosque was symbol of Hindu subjugation and no proof was required on matters of faith. It was not just a 16th-century structure that was reduced to rubble. Rather, the fundamentals of national polity were reworked and the seeming consensus on minority rights and privileges was modified.
Despite programmatic and ideological hegemony, BJP failed to return to power in Uttar Pradesh in November-December 1993. The party’s inability to secure majority was testimony to the primacy of electoral arithmetic and that tactical, albeit incompatible, alliances could be successfully forged for short-term objectives.
Back then, both Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) were in political infancy. Mulayam Singh Yadav broke up with the Janata conglomerate to establish his own outfit just a month prior to the Babri demolition.
BSP, too, had barely begun displaying its presence, winning at best a seat or two in the Lok Sabha and a handful in the assembly polls with vote share of 8-9 % — steady over successive polls since 1989 but insufficient for a decisive role. The SP-BSP pact worked, despite increasing its vote share by 2% to 33.3%, while BJP’s tally shrunk from 221 seats in 1991to 177 in 1993.
Because May 2018 bypoll in Kairana demonstrated that BJP could face a united opposition in UP and several other states, its leaders have upped the ante along familiar turf: Hindutva, this time round, with a wider focus. Several BJP leaders and affiliates have displayed enthusiasm to initiate the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya by circumventing the judicial fiat.
The Temple Template

The Ayodhya issue was long considered as one yielding diminishing returns. But after BJP and its partners linked this to multiple issues and initiatives — from campaigns on cow protection, nationalism and ‘urban Naxals’ to the latest drive of renaming cities — the dispute has staged a comeback in the majoritarian imagination. The temple’s construction is being seen as a symbol of Hindu supremacy. If the demolition was a watershed first step in de-hyphenating religious minorities from the political process, kick-starting the construction of the Ram temple will serve to underscore their relative relegation in public life.
So, what resounds emphatically with voters? BJP has a ‘leader’, while the Opposition is making the absence of a prime ministerial face a nonissue, pointing to the fact that its regional and national collective will decide post-polls on the final selection, if the opportunity arises. BJP’s opponents will push to break down the elections state by state, and depend on cumulative disenchantment with the Centre as well as with local issues. BJP, besides preventing the Opposition from uniting, still requires a national idea to preface pro-people government initiatives.
BJP’s overarching appeal cannot but have roots in identity politics — with a heavy dose of nationalism infused into it. This entails reversing its 2014 development-centric plank and putting emotive issues upfront. The base structure of the party’s election plank has become visible over the last few months. Be prepared for gongs to celebrate-commemorate and alarm bells to raise fears.
Celebrations will be over ‘stamping out’ Faizabad and Allahabad, overriding the Supreme Court on the Sabrimala temple issue, inaugurations of gigantic statues, etc. Warnings will be sounded out on chaotic coalitions, altering demography and international conspiracies.
The pitch in Indian elections has progressively become shriller. It’s like to go up a notch or two now as we enter the last lap towards the 2019 Lok Sabha polls finishing line.

113,1617655019-179,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Faith matters as much as law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/kaleidoscope/faith-matters-as-much-as-law/,Faith matters as much as law,"October 1, 2010, 1:47 PM  IST","December 6, 1992 will never be forgotten, for all the wrong reasons. 
September 30, 2010, will never be forgotten for all the right reasons.
Yesterday’s verdict of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on the Ayodhya land title suits will be remembered for many reasons; and one of them is that it was not an escapist verdict, an easy-way-out-of-a-difficult-situation verdict. 
The court addressed controversial issues head-on. One of them was that of faith. All these years, Hindu-leaning parties and organisations have been saying that ""matters of faith can never be decided by a court of law"". It was a dangerous proclamation. But luckily all their leaders, most prominently, L K Advani and Narendra Modi, said as loudly as they could, that they would accept the court verdict.
A matter of faith was indeed decided by the court. And now, post-verdict, some commentators — most ironically those not sympathetic to the Hindu viewpoint — are saying that the court shouldn’t have decided on a matter of faith.
It was incidental that in question here was the faith of one community. It could have been the faith of any community.
We all believe in something,
may be something rational, 
may be something irrational,
but we all believe in something.
And it’s here that faith comes in.
For a moment, let’s forget the temple and the mosque. Take something very ordinary. 
Would we have travelled in a train if we didn’t have faith in the train driver? No, we wouldn’t have. We buy a car because we have faith in the car manufacturer. We go to a doctor because we have faith in his ability to cure us. We approach a teacher because we have faith in her. We live because we have faith in everything that the future holds. Faith is all over the place. Faith does play a big role in our everyday life.
Imagine for a moment if the court had ordered: ""Let there be no temple, no mosque; forget 2.77 acre or whatever, get all the land people are fighting over; and let there be a childrens’ playground or a library or an educational complex on it."" That would have looked such an artificial compromise. We need courts to settle disputes; not to cover them up.
It’s a matter of great pride for India’s judiciary that despite all fears being raked up, the issue was addressed, settled and a solution offered. It’s for litigants to agree or disagree. There’s a higher court of appeal. And, it’s such a music to the ears to hear that aggrieved litigants will treat the matter closed once the Supreme Court pronounces the final verdict.
It’s a matter of great pride for Indians that we all exhibited remarkable amount of patience and understanding post-verdict. This was unprecedented. There were no loud, animated, partisan, emotional, discussions and arguments, or fraying of tempers. 
September 30, 2010, would also hopefully be remembered as the day India came out of its adolescent years. The day India quietly but powerfully broke off the beaten, dirty path, cut a new lane, on to a new, brighter tomorrow.
Finally, one request to Sonia, Advani, Lalu, Paswan and every other politician on whom the success of our democracy rests: Hope you all politicians saw the way we people reacted. We expect the same maturity from you. Please don’t play politics with this high court verdict. Let’s look ahead and move on. We have had enough of the past.
India has woken up to a new world on the first of October. Tomorrow is Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. For once, he would have had a reason to smile.

     The problem with Indian secularism is that it is founded on the atheism of Jawaharlal Nehru. Since 95% of the people of this country are religious minded, irrespective of whether they are Hindus, Muslims, Cristians etc, secularism based on atheism is not truly acceptable to majority of the people. Even in the western secular nations, the majority faith is not ridicules or suppressed as is being done in India. And that is a major problem.Faith is inevitable for any human being as the writer has stated, even if it is atheism which itself is another form of faith....  Read More

right reasonsyesterdays verdict of the lucknow bench of the allahabad high court on the ayodhya land title suits will be remembered for many reasons and one of them is that it was not an escapist verdict an easywayoutofadifficultsituation verdict the court addressed controversial issues headon one of them was that of faith all these years hinduleaning parties and organisations have been saying that matters of faith can never be decided by a court of law it was a dangerous proclamation but luckily all their leaders most prominently l k advani and narendra modi said as loudly as they could that they would accept the court verdicta matter of faith was indeed decided by the court and now postverdict some commentators — most ironically those not sympathetic to the hindu viewpoint — are saying that the court shouldnt have decided on a matter of faithit was incidental that in question here was the faith of one community it could have been the faith of any communitywe all believe in somethingmay be something rational may be something irrationalbut we all believe in somethingand its here that faith comes infor a moment lets forget the temple and the mosque take something very ordinary would we have travelled in a train if we didnt have faith in the train driver no we wouldnt have we buy a car because we have faith in the car manufacturer we go to a doctor because we have faith in his ability to cure us we approach a teacher because we have faith in her we live because we have faith in everything that the future holds faith is all over the place faith does play a big role in our everyday lifeimagine for a moment if the court had ordered let there be no temple no mosque forget 277 acre or whatever get all the land people are fighting over and let there be a childrens playground or a library or an educational complex on it that would have looked such an artificial compromise we need courts to settle disputes not to cover them upits a matter of great pride for indias judiciary that despite all fears being raked up the issue was addressed settled and a solution offered its for litigants to agree or disagree theres a higher court of appeal and its such a music to the ears to hear that aggrieved litigants will treat the matter closed once the supreme court pronounces the final verdictits a matter of great pride for indians that we all exhibited remarkable amount of patience and understanding postverdict this was unprecedented there were no loud animated partisan emotional discussions and arguments or fraying of tempers september 30 2010

114,1617655127-206,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/5/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,"This Diwali, let Ram’s spirit bring out best in Hindus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/bloody-mary/this-diwali-let-rams-spirit-bring-out-best-in-hindus/,"This Diwali, let Ram’s spirit bring out best in Hindus","October 27, 2019, 10:08 AM  IST","Lamps glow and sparkle on Diwali. It’s the time when the victorious king Ram returned home to Ayodhya and then went on to establish the Ram Rajya, or the kingdom defined by universal citizenship and justice for all. In 2019, the legend of Ram has acquired a special significance. This year, there’s a growing sense of anticipation among the ranks of political Hindus that the Supreme Court will soon clear the way for a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. UP CM Yogi Adityanath has planned a grand ‘deepotsav’ and Diwali with a Ramayana theme. In TV studios, sadhus and sants are speaking in triumphalist tones, referring to the Ram Mandir as a ‘victory’ even before a judicial verdict is pronounced.
BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has announced that the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya will begin on December 6. The gentle salutation ‘Jai Shri Ram’ has been converted into such an aggressive chant that a group of citizens recently lamented it has become a “provocative war cry”. But have those who call themselves Ram’s warriors acquainted themselves with the spirit of Ram?
Ram’s divinity came from his intense humanity —throughout the Ramayana he is presented as a flawed human striving for excellence. Ram lost his kingdom, was forced to fight long wars, yet was never depicted as angry or wrathful. Instead the Ramayana is full of moral dilemmas and exploration of human bonds. Ram’s tribulations in his closest relationships is one of the reasons the Ramayana speaks so powerfully down the generations, and why it is so uniquely modern. Should the richly philosophical Ram be used to assert angry politicised Hindutva on the street? How can a text which exudes so much humanity, be used to foment hatred and rage?
Manufactured Hindu victimhood surrounds the Ram Mandir agitation, one that keeps harking to medieval wars and harps on Hindu places of worship being attacked by marauding Islamic invaders of past centuries, emphasising that the Hindu is still in perpetual siege from the enemy within. The recent murder of the Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari has only bolstered this campaign. Yet while the Tiwari murder case has been cracked and the killers caught in swift police action, the murderers of intellectuals like M M Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and Gauri Lankesh have still not been traced. There is justifiable outrage on the slaying of Tiwari. Yet when those accused of lynching in the name of cow protection are granted bail or when police investigations into violent acts of “gau raksha” are slow and half-hearted, arguments are mounted that so called “cattle smugglers” deserve punishment by mobs. With the Kashmir Valley placed under a harsh lockdown and daily reports of human suffering and misery coming, is it the Hindus who are the victims of today? Ram’s capacity for empathy seems to have deserted those who speak in his name.
Ram is a personification of the human, and thus of the divinity within every human being. He embodies the individual capacity to strive for excellence, for goodness. Ram possesses no magical powers, instead his powers come from his own struggle to build his own capacities. It’s this heroic struggle to be his best self — from his relationships with his parents, to being forced into penury to a lonely war to the dilemmas of the battlefield, to his troubled marital relations and estrangement from his sons — that makes Ram the maryada purushottam or the perfect man.
Can a figure whose entire life is about achieving one’s best self, now be used to give licence for the worst kinds of aggression and sharp politics? Or to browbeat minorities in his name when Ram’s kingdom was one of justice? The tragic politicisation of Ram has prevented us from becoming true legatees and inheritors of the Ram legend. In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Masjid sparked terrible riots in which hundreds were killed. Those responsible got away with their act of criminality, some even using it as a political ladder to ascend in public life. Should a modern nation in 2019 be obsessed with avenging the acts of a 16th-century invader and blame today’s Indian Muslims for the burdens of history? This Diwali, lets rejoice in the spirit of Ram, the inclusive humanist, rather than prepare to play dangerous political games that are divisive and potentially violent.
Let’s not reduce an inspiring text like the Ramayana to an empty slogan. If we imprison Ram in a political agenda, we grow distant from the empathetic hero who constantly strove for truth. If Ram becomes hostage to violent street armies, we do a terrible injustice to the god-king’s persona and the ideal he has represented down the generations.

     I didn't read this blog. But I am sure when Muslims are spreading all kinds of hate and violence all over the world she won't write on Eid a similar piece for Muslims. Hindus are by and large peaceful and pluralistic but she won't care because it will shut her shop. Isn't it a fact that Hindus remained peaceful even though they suffered ethnical cleansing in Pakistan Bangladesh and Kashmir. But this line of argument doesn't suit likes Of Sagarika and her ilk....  Read More

As the Lok Sabha elections approach, and we get inundated with numerous surveys, not to mention the cacophony on social media, perhaps it’s the right time to recall philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s words, referring to the Roman deity of wisdom and history, from his Philosophy of Right, ‘The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.’
Since a proper poll analysis can be conducted only after the election verdict, one can, at best, cast a hawk’s eye on the pre-poll landscape to form a coherent picture. This is a daunting task since the stance of political leaders towards one another remains as fickle as the weather. What appears to be a good guesstimate on one day, looks inaccurate on another.

Taking Stock of Frenemies 
Often, this very banter is part of the negotiation tactics. Take, for instance, the shifting posture of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) towards one another. Till there is clarity on this, there is no foreseeing the extent of BJP’s worries in Delhi.
Uncertainty within political parties across the spectrum also underscores the power of the proverbial ‘silent voter’. In India, there is no evidence of rigged verdicts, as may be the case in several parts of the world, although ‘controlled voting’ at the booth level can be challenging.
The pre-election period is when the ‘heroic’ sheen of even the most astute leader wears thin. It is a time when he or she is most likely to make mistakes. Recall Indira Gandhi’s decision to call for polls in January 1977, simply because of the belief that she would win.
Or her son Rajiv Gandhi’s decision to kick-start the 1989 campaign from Ayodhya and promise ‘Ram Rajya’ to people on the assumption that after squaring with Muslim conservatism, he could enlist caste Hindus too.
Also, recall Congress self-goals in Gujarat during the last assembly polls in 2017. Or BJP’s overestimations in Bihar and Delhi in 2015.
The game board, after the end of Parliament session, offers little clarity at this stage. Whatever coherence seemed to appear in early January was unsettled with Congress announcing Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s formal entry into politics. The die in Uttar Pradesh, which had appeared to have been cast, was recast and presents some worry for BJP, on the one hand, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)-Samajwadi Party (SP) alliance, on the other.
Gandhi Vadra’s entry, coupled with Rahul Gandhi’s assertion of the party’s double vision — a focus on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well as UP’s assembly elections in 2022 — has enthused a moribund party network, even as its capacity to convert crowds into votes remains untested. At this stage, there is no certainty if UP will witness a threecornered contest, or whether Congress will eventually be accommodated, openly or tacitly, by the BSP-SP duo.
First Among Non-Equals?
The final picture would depend, to a great extent, on Mayawati’s ambition for a role at the Centre of a non-BJP, non-Congress government. The BSP leader senses that a potential leadership position would be undermined if Congress is part of an anti-BJP alliance, either in UP or nationally, because Rahul Gandhi — besides Congress’ wider presence beyond specific states —has made a case for himself by taking Prime Minister Narendra Modi head-on on issues, while most regional leaders, Mayawati included, have limited themselves to a ‘Modi hatao’ discourse.
Although the ‘Priyanka’ wild card is currently restricted to UP in the formal sense, there is no knowing if she would campaign in other states to bolster her brother’s image.
Before Modi, only Indira and Rajiv Gandhi secured resounding victories in 1971 and 1984, but they both lost the elections that followed. With history stacked against him, and also because the ‘certainty’ that everyone was talking about in 2017 is less certain now, the probability of Modi bucking the trend has declined. However, Modi has the advantage of going into elections with no visible anti-incumbency against him, even as there is also no discernible pro-incumbent sentiment.
This allows him a better opportunity to highlight his ‘achievements’.
A similar situation, though, existed in 2004 when not a single pollster had predicted Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s defeat. His personal ratings, too, were high and the economy was doing well enough for the government to use ‘India Shining’ as its campaign slogan.
In his political career, Modi has never faced such a wide array of challenges as he does today. The Opposition, too, senses an opportunity they previously thought would not come their way for years. With Hegel’s Minerva’s owl still in slumber, it is time to put weathercocks on high alert.

116,1617655015-178,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/page/6/?s=Ayodhya+verdict,Living in the time of fear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/No-Man-Land/living-in-the-time-of-fear/,Living in the time of fear,"September 26, 2010, 10:00 AM  IST","Imagine being evicted of your home, your birthplace, where you’ve lived all your life and where generations have spent a lifetime. Imagine it being burnt down in front of your eyes by a rioting mob. Imagine living under the constant fear and uncertainty of ‘what if’ only because you belong to a certain community. Imagine the enormity of this fear, if you are living in Gujarat.
How real is this fear? ""Ask me! Just few days ago, my staff came to me asking where to put my studio’s stuff, since verdict on Ayodhya issue is on September 24 (it has now been postponed to September 28) and I will be in Malaysia during that time,"" says this well-known Ahmedabad-based artist.
He comes from a creative background and belongs to the educated Muslim class. He is an interior design graduate from one of the reputed design schools in the city and in the last 16 years, he has built a rich repertoire of Indian embroidery. He owns a swanky studio in one of the posh localities of the city. The scars of ’92 riots are so fresh in his mind that he doesn’t trust anyone in such circumstances. ""I have asked my staff to vacate the studio and put away all my belongings at my place in the old city. My collection that I’ve built so painstakingly is not insured. I can’t see them being destroyed,"" he says.
It’s almost two decades but he still lives with the pain of those memories. It was shocking for me because I was face to face with the decades old fear for the first time. I was not here when the two major riots happened. So, I only have the images of what media fed us with, both electronically and in the print. Meeting him was like seeing the enormity of the suffering. I began calling up people, all educated and belonging to liberal Muslim class, and talking to them. The undercurrent is so tense… their pain and fear are so deep-rooted.
Babri masjid demolition, post-Godhra riots or 9/11… just a mention of these events and the discomfort is palpable. ""My husband’s factory was burnt twice, in 1990 and again in 1992 during communal violence in the wake of Babri masjid episode, and looted once during 2002 riots,"" says a social activist working with a local NGO for riot-affected people. ""We didn’t have the heart to go back and rebuild the entire thing from the scratch,"" she says, tears welling up in her eyes. Instead, they decided to relocate to a place, where other Muslim families lived.
Ahmedabad was not polarised on communal lines before 1969, when during a major riot 600 people were killed in a single day. Mass exodus of Muslims to ‘safer places’ began after anti-reservation violence in 1985. What began as a protest against reservation policy of the state government soon took the shape of communal violence between Hindus and Muslims within a month.
""Tame ke va (what are you), my neighbour asked me when I shifted to my present address after my marriage. She was confused because neither I looked like a Parsi as I am not fair nor I had a Hindu surname. Moreover, I am married to a Jew who people think is a Christian. So, I told her that I am Gujarati,"" says a research scholar from UK, adding that her answer was not wrong because ""I am a Gujarati"". In Gujarat, Muslims are not referred to as Gujaratis, nor do they call themselves Gujaratis.
It’s sad. More so as the city boasts of a rich history and efforts are being made to get Ahmedabad the world heritage city status. History states that different communities lived here in harmony. In fact, Ahmedabad was founded by a Muslim ruler, Sultan Ahmed Shah, on February 26, 1411 AD.
Legend has it that while camping on the banks of the Sabarmati River, the sultan saw a hare chasing a dog. He was so intrigued by this that he asked his spiritual adviser for explanation. The sage pointed out unique characteristics of the land, which nurtured such rare qualities that inspired a timid hare to chase a ferocious dog. Impressed by this, the sultan, who had been looking for a place to build his new capital, decided to found the capital here and called it Ahmedabad.   
Teen Darwaza in the walled city has seen bloodiest communal riots, but it is here that the lamp of hope burns for harmony. According to folklore, nearly 600 years ago, Khwaja Siddiqui, a guard of the ancient city posted at Teen Darwaza, had stopped goddess Lakshmi from leaving the city without the permission of Sultan Ahmed Shah. The goddess promised that she would wait till he returned. The guard went to the sultan and asked to be beheaded. Having given her word to the guard, the goddess was forced to stay back.
In the memory of the guard’s sacrifice and honour to the goddess, a lamp burns 24X7 to this day at Teen Darwaza, one of Ahmedabad’s 12 beautiful gates.
As the date of the verdict on Ayodhya issue nears, one can feel the uneasiness building up. ""We only hope that the peace that has been restored in the last decade is not disturbed,"" says a city-based academician, who teaches history at a local college.  
And, so do I.
